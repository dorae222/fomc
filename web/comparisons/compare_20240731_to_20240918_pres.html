Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of
August.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy
restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>This decision reflects our
growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the
labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving
sustainably down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data
point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth of consumer spending has
remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic
pace last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising
strongly in the first.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the
strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic
Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median
projection of 2 percent over the next few years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 26

In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged
116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in
the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage
growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, a broad
set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before
the pandemic in 2019.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year,
four-tenths higher than projected in June.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food
and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation expectations
appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households,
businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median projection
in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat
lower than projected in June.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For much of the past three years,
inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely
tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 2 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply
and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well
anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much
closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation
have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We now see the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the
risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today’s meeting, the
Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to
4¾ percent to 5 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of
the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we
begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are not on any preset course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At
the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and
employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,
the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
Page 3 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this
year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These median projections are lower than in June,
consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the
changed balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy remains solid and inflation
persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to
respond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in
pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In July, you said you weren’t necessarily thinking about a 50.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You didn’t want to be
specific, but you said you weren’t thinking about a 50.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The inflation data last week came out a
little firmer than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what
Page 4 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it
shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I guess, should we expect more
50s in the months ahead?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And based on what should we make that call?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Laughter] Let me jump in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
since the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve had the
two employment reports, July and August.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one
that came in during blackout.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not
maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high
and will be revised down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data
collected in] the Beige Book.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we took all of those, and we went into blackout.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we
thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the
people that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s one question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What
was the second and third?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do we make the—sorry, thank you, sir.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do we figure out
in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that
call?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So a couple things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A good place to start is the—is the SEP,
but let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by
meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If you look at
the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from
where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s
more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that process will take
place over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to
Page 5 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
get this done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This, this process evolves over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, that’s a projection.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a
baseline projection.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do
will depend on the way the economy evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can go quicker if that’s appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We can
go slower if that’s appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can pause if that’s appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s, that’s what we are
contemplating.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the
Committee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are
thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRIS RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
projections show that the Fed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their
estimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So does that suggest that you see rates as
restrictive for that entire period?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you
said you’d like to avoid?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little
bit higher?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I
think people write down their estimate, individuals do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think every single person on the
Committee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s
a wide range where that could fall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are model-based
approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any
given time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, realistically, we know it by its works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that leaves us in a place where we’ll
be—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be
looking at the way the economy reacts to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the
question that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We know—if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a
time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Today, unemployment
is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we know that it is time to
recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and
on employment moving to a more sustainable level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the balance of risks are now even.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of
neutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What you have
is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How close was this in terms
of the decision?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was the weight
clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we had a good—a good discussion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, if you go
back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut
and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so there was a lot of
discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there was also
broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would add, though, look at the
SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All 19.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a big change
from June, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Seven of the—seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the
19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you
know, there is a dissent, and there’s a range of views, but there’s actually a lot of common
ground as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Follow-up to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now that this is in the books, can you give
us some guidance as sort of a follow-up to Steve on the pacing here?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you expect this to
be running every other meeting once we get into next year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s
no sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We made a good, strong start to this,
and that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down
toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That gives us the ability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can, you know, make a
good, strong start.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—and I’m very pleased that we did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To me, the logic of this, both from an
economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think we’re
going to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for
taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the
unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Obviously, historically, when the
unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’t typically
just stop—it continues increasing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the
labor market stabilizing, sort of what’s the mechanism there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what do you see as the risks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our
intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can say that about the whole
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The U.S. economy is in good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming
down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s what we’re
doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry—Nick.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, does today’s
action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data,
or is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate
such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, multiple questions in there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say we don’t think
we’re behind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of
our commitment not to get behind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s, it’s a strong move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, your other question was?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between
this meeting and the last meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or is this about the level of the funds rate—the high nominal
level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you’re trying to maintain equilibrium?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that
was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation
and very low unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve waited.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our
confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that is what enables
us to take this, this strong move today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do not think that anyone should look at this and say,
“Oh, this is the new pace.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of
course, what happens will happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP,
you see cuts moving along.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a
more neutral level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given
Page 9 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
developments in the economy and the base case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy can develop in a way that would
cause us to go faster or slower, but that’s what the base case is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you
did the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With a larger cut today, is
there any—should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “end
state” on the balance sheet policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They
haven’t come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As
you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this
at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that these two things can happen side by side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In a sense, they’re both a form of
normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting
rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>COLBY SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just following up
on Jeanna’s question on rising unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Is it your view that this is just a function of a
normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something
more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have
softened too?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not—why should we not expect
a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have
cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level—
the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 10 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So you’re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what’s driving it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Clearly, clearly
payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many—
By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a
very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the labor market bears
close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But ultimately, we think—we believe,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing,
and that will support the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic
activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an
economy that is still growing at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that should also support the labor market over
time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but again, we’re—it bears watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to
happen, wouldn’t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin
to recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising
layoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something
that’s getting ready to happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there
is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when
we begin to see the layoffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s some lore on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s the situation we’re in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have,
in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that
we consider.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions
meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To follow up on
that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a
higher unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style—
rather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So if—as I
mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the
ability to react to that by, by cutting faster.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate,
though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to
2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ll be to the labor market,
since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant
amount of monetary easing to just maintain it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see
further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we have a
dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we
been trying to achieve?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability
without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’re trying to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think you can take today’s action as a sign of our strong
commitment to achieve that goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 12 of 26

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re describing this view that you don’t think you’re behind when it
comes to the job market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be
most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve mentioned a couple, but would you be
able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job
market now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most
important one probably.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re at 4.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we
were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back
over the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Participation
is at high levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for
aging, participation’s at pretty high levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a good thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wages are still a bit above what
would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the
very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to
what that sustainable level is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we feel good about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Vacancies over—per unemployed is
back to what is still a very strong level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not as high as it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That number reached two to
one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As measured, it’s now below—it’s around
one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, quits have come
back down to normal levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I could go on and on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>There are many, many employment
indicators.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What do they say?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>They say this is still a solid labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The question isn’t the
level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you
know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the
Page 13 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
downside risks to employment have increased.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and because we have been patient and held
our fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we’re now in a very good
position to manage the risks to both of our goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what do you expect to learn between now and November that
will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, more data, the usual.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Don’t look for anything else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll
see another labor report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll see another jobs report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we get a—we might, actually—
we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the
Friday before the meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and inflation data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll get all this data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications
of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and
think, what’s the right thing to do?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of
our goals over time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin with Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve only been
running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you view that
level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be—would you be content if we
were to kind of stick at that level?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the
last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather
than job losses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor
market cooling will have to come through job losses?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows,
right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating
Page 14 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
100,000 jobs, you’re going to see unemployment go up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it really depends on what’s the trend
underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We understand there’s been quite an
influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed
the unemployment rate to rise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is
something we also watch carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think
everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long
way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment,
job loss.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things
with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that
further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s been—
it’s been a great ride down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor
market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½,
maybe under 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near-
zero federal funds rate, and some think we’re heading in that direction again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s the
likelihood that cheap money is now the norm?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Intuitively, most—many,
many people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were
trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at
Page 15 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
negative rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so—and it
was—people were issuing debt at negative rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It seems that’s so far away now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My own sense
is that we’re not going back to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, you
know, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was
back then.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How high is it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t—I just don’t think we know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—again, we only know it by
its works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will
likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,
and, you know, it’s always the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in
particular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we do that, and
we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s—that’s always what it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
never about anything else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things
that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, nonetheless, this is
what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, if we
get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this really concentrates the
mind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t put up any other
filters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we just don’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My first
question is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the
American people, with this unusually large rate cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place,
and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>More specifically, the economy is
growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and
the labor market is still in solid shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we
currently see in the U.S. economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll do that by returning rates from their high level,
which has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re,
we’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just have a follow-up to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Listening to you talk about inflation
moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive
victory over inflation and rising prices?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, we’re not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So inflation, you know—what we say is we want
inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think we’re going
to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re
certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I have
to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CATARINA SARAIVA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just would love
to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we’ve seen in housing
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging
a bit, if I can say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which
Page 17 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’re not rolling over—the leases that are
rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, you know, it’s been
slower than we expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those
lower market rents to get into this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as
market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time
it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As long
as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say it’s—the
rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I
believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services
piece, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with
starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing
market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People don’t want to sell their homes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As rates
come down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many
cases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean,
the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough
housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so it’s going to be challenging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places
Page 18 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where people want to live.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and,
you know, where are we going to get the supply?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is not something that the Fed can, can
really fix.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, I
mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and
getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And then
the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Just following up on some of the
labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and
I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too
much comes from the fact that you’re starting to act now and that’s going to give people more
room to run versus just the labor market is strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, also, if I could, following up on
Nick’s question, do you see today’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that
you didn’t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at forecasters or
talk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s no
sense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know,
business people who are actually out there doing business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, you know, I think our
move is timely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as I said, you can—you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a
commitment to make sure that we don’t fall behind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re really asking about—your second question, you’re asking about July.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I
guess if you ask if we’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We might
Page 19 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t make that decision, but we might well have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think that’s not—you know,
that doesn’t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let’s look, you know—at
this meeting we’re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report,
the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things
that I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re looking at all of those things, and we’re asking ourselves, what’s the
right—what’s the policy stance we need to move to?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We knew—it’s clear that we—clearly,
literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’s time to move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just how big—how fast
do you go, and what do you think about the paths forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this decision we made today had
broad support on the Committee, and I’ve discussed the path ahead.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>How
much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Very hard for me to say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really
speak to mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our intention,
though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think that it’s time to
begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come
down as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the
economy performs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to
be doing—going to be doing.</strong></em></p>

home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What do you say to those
households?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had
a burst of inflation.</strong></em></p>

when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy
off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s not something that people experience as
pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And a
good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about
inflation anymore.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just keep it low, keep it stable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re restoring that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what we’re going through now really
restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Price stability benefits everybody
over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I completely—we don’t
tell people how to think about the economy, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, of course, people are [still]
experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we understand that’s painful.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was wondering
if you could go through—you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was
like an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would sort of
argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President
John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the
day.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, I mean, could you talk—
Page 21 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a
50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was
a really small probability of a 50 point cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that play in your consideration at all?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just talk
a little bit about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for
the economy at that time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’ll do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what we did today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve mentioned how closely you’re watching the labor market, but you also noted
that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward
revisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And given the
SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be
the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,
including the payroll numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not discarding those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we’ll certainly look at those,
but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There isn’t a bright line.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of
course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move
that would dictate one thing or another.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data
on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our
policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Matt Egan from CNN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I know that you discussed
earlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, in general,
can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed
decisions on interest rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Because that’s something that former President Trump, who
obviously appointed you, has previously suggested.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I know the Fed is designed to be
independent, but why?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So countries that are—democracies around the world,
countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central
banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from
direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe
people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s the idea, is that—
you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get
lower inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not
serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s just maximum
employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s how the other central
banks are set up, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public
and I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking the
questions, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask
you about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the
changes to the Basel III endgame.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what
those changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you’re looking

for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then
yesterday, other banking regulators—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know what, hold the second question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll give you the second question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the answer to your question
is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with
my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that
Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, yes, that is—that’s happening
with my support.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there a date for that—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re putting
them out for comment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t
have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea
is that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly
where that is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment,
and then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them,
and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, yesterday.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>there were merger reform finalizations
from the other bank regulators.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair
Barr.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer, for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 24 of 26

JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration
strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even
though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly
balanced.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given what you’ve said, though, today, I’m curious, are you more worried about the
job market and growth than inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are they not roughly balanced?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had a historically tight labor
market, historically tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we
had inflation way above target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation,
concentrate on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put
in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Part of
bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what that tells
you is, it’s time to change our stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we did that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The sense of the change in the stance is
that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And today
was—I think we made a good strong start on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it was the right decision, and I think it
should send a signal that we, you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome
here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that
could tip it into recession?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it
this way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You see—you see growth at
a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that’s, that’s still at very
solid levels.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 31, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the
past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate
remains low.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy
that benefits everyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in
order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are attentive to
risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after
briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent
last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment,
government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of underlying demand—
grew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Growth of consumer spending
has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Investment in equipment and
intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the housing sector, investment
stalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Improving supply conditions have
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter—a solid pace, but
below that seen in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at
4.1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged
25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has eased over the past
year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that
conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the
pandemic—strong, but not overheated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our
longer-run goal of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in
June; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose
2.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a
broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from
financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials
like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As
the labor market has cooled and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment
Page 2 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and inflation goals continue to move into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Indeed, we’re attentive to the risks to
both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the
federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably
toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and
more good data would further strengthen that confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our
decisions meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much
could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At the same time, reducing
policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In
considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will
carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If the economy remains solid and inflation
persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than
anticipated, we are prepared to respond.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and
uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our success in
delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that our actions affect
communities, families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in service to our
Page 3 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wonder if
you think that’s a reasonable expectation, and, if so, why not just make the move today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on September, let me say this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we have made no
decisions about future meetings, and that includes the September meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The broad sense of
the Committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to
reduce our policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will
not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The question will be
whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with
rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If that test is met, a
reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you asked, why not today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the
Committee is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our
policy rate but that we’re not quite at that point yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So just to, to follow up on that a bit, if inflation behaves as
you expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the
baseline scenario right now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I would—I would think about it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll give an
example of, of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’t be
Page 4 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
appropriate to cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or
less in line with expectations, growth remains, let’s say, reasonably strong, and the labor market
remains, you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a, a rate cut
could be on the table at the September meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If, if inflation were to prove, you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from
inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I
think it’s going to be not just any one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s going to be the inflation data, it’s going to be
the employment data, it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it—it’s going to be the
totality of all of that that would help us make this decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And just to follow up on that—specifically, in what ways
right now, given all you’ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et
cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to
2 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think it’s just a question of seeing more good data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have
seen—the last couple of readings have, have certainly added to confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve seen
progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation—that’s goods, nonhousing services,
and housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So it’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at
the beginning of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then we saw some more good inflation data; we had seven months at
the end of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we just want to see more and, and gain confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as I
said, we have—we did gain confidence, and more good data would cause us to, to gain more
confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 25

COLBY SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The March SEP
pointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at
4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Since we’re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was
projected for the labor market, I’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best
guidepost for policy rather than, let’s say, the shallower one laid out in that June SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, so I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to
depend on the way the economy evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I can’t really give you any, any better forward
guidance on it than that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will do another
one at the September meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would just say, I can—I can imagine a scenario in which there
would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves,
and I wouldn’t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve said what I—what I can
say about September and about today, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Chair Powell, you’ve said
before that you wouldn’t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation
has lagged.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that apply for the labor market, too?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the labor market is back in equilibrium,
why is restrictive policy and, potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate,
warranted right now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is the very reason that we’re thinking about—that we’ve said
in our—in our statement that we’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the
risks are coming back into balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is
an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move, really, from
Page 6 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
overheated conditions to more normal conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We are watching the labor market conditions
quite closely, and that’s what we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we—if we start to see something that looks to be
more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s part of what we’re thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And when you talk about seeing something that’s more than
whatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ve said that stronger growth
wouldn’t, wouldn’t override better news on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder how that cuts the other way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If
you’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change
the calculus on what you’re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have, we have—growth isn’t one of our three.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have two
mandates, as you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market, maximum employment is one, and stable prices is
another.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we weigh—we weigh those two things equally under the law.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When we were far
away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now we’re back, back to a closer to
even focus, so we’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we’re getting what
we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as I said, we’re prepared to respond if we see that it’s—that it’s not what we wanted
to see, which was, you know, a gradual normalization of conditions—if we see more than that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And it wouldn’t be any one statistic, although, of course, the unemployment rate is generally
thought to be, you know, a single—a good single statistic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’d be looking at wages, we’d
be looking at participation, we’d be looking at all the things—surveys, quits, hires, all of those
things—to determine the overall status of the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re looking at it now.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I would say, again, I think you’re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions,
and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think inflation
was actually—core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we don’t think—I don’t
Page 7 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary
pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would—I would not like to see a material further cooling in the labor market, and
that’s part of what’s behind our thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The other part, of course, is that we have made real
progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we’re—we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite
there yet, but we’re more confident that we’re on a—that we’re on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those two things are working together, and we’re factoring those both into our
policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned not
wanting to see any further cooling in the job market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why not?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or would you consider
preemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that something you
would cut ahead of time for?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t want to see any other cooling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would
be more of a material difference.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If we—if we’d be looking at this and if we see something that
looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have
the intention of responding to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in terms of—I don’t think of it that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think of it as, you
know, we’re actually in a good place here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re balancing these two risks of, you know, go too
soon, and you undermine progress on inflation; wait too long or don’t go fast enough, and, and
you put at risk the recovery.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we have to balance those two things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the nature of
having two mandates, and I think we—this is how we balance them.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s a rough balance, but it
does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it’s in a place where it’s just a process of
ongoing normalization; 4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’ll
just have to see what the data show us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, just to follow up quickly: [I] wanted to see what
you thought of the recent JOLTS report, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down
even below 2019 levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Layoffs remain low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it painted a picture of a very static labor
market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the
direction we would want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job
openings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was good.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today’s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that’s, that’s
a good reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level
continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s exactly the pattern that we
want to be seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I think the data—the data we’ve been seeing in the labor market are
broadly consistent with that normalization process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, we’re closely monitoring to see
whether it starts to show signs that it’s more than that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked
about cutting rates as a process, and, in June, you talked about the idea that, well, one rate cut
wouldn’t do anything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wonder if you can sort of—following up on Colby’s question—talk
about, are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate
cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Talk us through the process that you think—or is it just one rate cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or are you in the
process now of thinking that rates need to be normalized here?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I can’t really say that, honestly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re—we—
we’ve seen significant movement in the labor market, and, you know, we’re very mindful of this
question of, is it just normalization or is it more?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think it’s just normalization, but we want
to be in a position to, to support the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, we’re seeing progress on
Page 9 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we actually got to this—we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment—sorry, inflation was
over 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was a completely different economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now we’ve made a lot of progress, and
the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid-3s, so it’s a different economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
I think it’s time, it’s coming to be time, to adjust that so that we support this continued process.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The thing we’re trying to do is—you know that we have, we’ve had this really significant
decline in inflation, and unemployment has remained low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is a really unusual and
historically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What
we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is—this is part of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We think we don’t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ve
made: 12-month headline at 2½ [percent], core at 2.6.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s way down from where it
was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The job is not done on inflation, but, nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the
restriction in our policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think we’re just—it’s part of a process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of what that looks like, I mean, I think most rate—you would think, in a base
case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’t want to try to give specific
forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think
that’s really going to depend on the economy, and that’s highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we
saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would
you characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 10 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Actually, what we’re seeing now is a little better than what we saw
last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last
year was from goods prices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an
unsustainable rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is a broader disinflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This has goods prices coming down, but it’s
also—we’re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories: nonhousing services and
housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, the thing is, we’ve only—you’ve got one quarter of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We
had seven months of low inflation; you got one quarter of this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say the quality of this is,
is higher, and it’s good, but so far, it’s only a quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think, you know, we need to see more
to know that we’re—to have more confidence that we’re on, on a good path down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we’ve been getting good data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
things like the ECI report and, frankly, the softening in the labor market conditions, you know,
give you more confidence that the economy’s not overheating.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t look like an
overheating economy, and it looks like an economy that’s normalizing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if we’re to think about the first couple months of the year, is
there any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate
cuts as were some of the projections going into 2024?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the thing about—if what it is is seasonality, and it could just be—
it’s very, very hard to, you know, to do appropriate seasonal adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If that’s what it is,
then that actually implies that, that other months were underreporting too low inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you
smoothed it out, it’s a zero-sum game.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s why we look at 12 months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at
12 months because that takes all of that out, all those effects out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Twelve-month now is
2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is so much better than where we were even a year
ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a lot better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, the job is not done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to stress that, and we’re committed to
Page 11 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
getting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress,
and we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more
equally than we did a year ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d like to
ask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>At this point, is the risk greater
to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the
economy in slowing demand and raising prices?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Or is it more important for the American people
that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I—you know, I think that we’ve been given an assignment by
Congress.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment
and price stability, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so in our, you know, quasi-constitutional document, the Statement
on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals, and if one of
them is farther away than the other—the two variables, inflation and employment—if one is
farther away from its goal than the other, then you, you concentrate on the one that’s farther
away.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you take account of the time to reach the goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, for the last couple of years, the best service we could do to the American people was
to focus on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But as inflation has come down—and I think the upside risks to inflation
have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now the labor market has softened—you
know, probably the inflation, inflation’s probably a little farther from its target than is
employment, but I think the downside risks to, to the employment mandate are, are real now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
we have to weigh all that, and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive
policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s clearly restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s been the rate we’ve had in place for a full year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the
Page 12 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
time is coming—as other central banks around the world are facing the same question—the time
is coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions, restriction
so that we may address both mandates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday
and another one before you meet again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you certain that you won’t fall behind the curve and
lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHAIR POWELL. “</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Certainty” is not a word that we have in our—in our business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
you know, we get—we get a lot of data between now and September, and it isn’t going to be one
data read or even two.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just—and
then how is that affecting the outlook?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And how is it affecting the balance of risks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
going to be the assessment that we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Of course, we’ll, we’ll all look carefully at the
employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and
the September meeting, and we’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence of Fox
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a,
a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Looking at the
job sides, we’ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve—we’re hearing on
earnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the jobs report from the BLS,
government jobs has been a leading creator.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could the government jobs—as a sector—hiring
mask underlying weakness in the jobs report?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you know, we’ll look at everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen some, some
tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we’ve
Page 13 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
had some months where, where job creation was broader.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, you know, the headline
number of jobs has come down, so—but you look at the whole thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think you do look at
private demand extra carefully, to your point about, about government.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll just be looking
at, at all those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just as a follow then—so could the Fed then be behind the
curve?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Because you said some of the reports—in the last meeting, you said the reports could be
noisy or overstated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was there a discussion of, of—what kind of discussion was there for a cut
today, and could the Fed be “behind the curve”?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve been—you know, we, we had
seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We said we wanted to see more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
said—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first
quarter wasn’t, wasn’t great—inflation data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And now we’ve got another quarter—a quarter that
is good.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’re balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too
late.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s no guarantee in this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a very difficult judgment call,
but this is—this is how we’re making it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a—you know, we had
a nice conversation about, about this issue today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The overall sense of the Committee, as I
mentioned, is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial
back restriction, but we’re not quite at that point yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to see more good data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
decision was unanimous—all 19 participants supported it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But there was a real discussion back
and forth of what the case would be for, for moving at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A strong majority supported
Page 14 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
moving—not moving at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was the strong sense of the Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s a
conversation that we had today, certainly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When the Fed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and
variable lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder if that applies on the way down, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How are you and the Committee
thinking about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, it does.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the
last six months, by the way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You, you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean, even a
few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look at the labor market
now—you can see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And look at inflation—sorry—rate-sensitive, interest-sensitive spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You really do see now that policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say it’s extremely restrictive, but it’s
certainly effectively restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, there—the lag should, should be on the way down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
should take some time to get into—to get into the full economy, affect financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing, and, ultimately, inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
doesn’t—it’s not instantaneous, although it’s faster than it used to be because markets move now
in anticipation of our moves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long
and variable lags, even when you’re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the Fed to
help stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to worry about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we—just to make it clear, you
know, it’s a very difficult, challenging judgment, and we don’t want to go too soon, and we don’t
want to go too late.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s—this is how we made that judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I feel good about where we
Page 15 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re certainly very well positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at
5.3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not
what we’re seeing, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we’re seeing—look at the—look at the first-half growth
numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not signaling a weak economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
also not signaling an overheating economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate has moved up seven-tenths, and we’re
seeing—we’re seeing normalization there, but wage, wage increases are still at a high level.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Unemployment is still at a low level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Layoffs are very low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Initial claims have moved up, but
they’re pretty stable, and they’re historically not high at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So the total scope of the data
suggests a normalizing labor market, and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that
continues to be the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>On the labor market, I was
wondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the
Sahm rule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—so I would just say, the question really is, is one of, are we
worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and the answer is, we’re watching
really carefully for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a—I
would call it a statistical, statistical thing that has happened through history.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A “statistical
regularity” is what I’d call it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not like an economic rule where it’s telling you something
must happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, again, what do we see?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What are our eyes telling us?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at—we look at all the
things we’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market—again, job creation at a
Page 16 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
pretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job
vacancies have come down, but they’re still high by historical standards.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, again, I’ve been
through some of the data already, but what we think we’re seeing is, is a normalizing labor
market, and we’re watching carefully to see if it—if it turns out to be more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If it starts to show
signs that it’s more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave
differently this time than it has historically?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That
statement is very true about the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You never assume it’s going to be just the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>An
example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are many, many
examples, so it’s never exactly the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also, let’s remember that this pandemic era has been
one in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve
for starters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, many, many received—pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s
because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the
shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very
strong demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the whole—the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior
inflation or downturns that we’ve seen or business cycles that we’ve seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re having to
learn.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
we don’t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themselves automatically.</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the
very recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you take those anecdotes seriously—
Page 17 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that is, that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what’s shown in
the data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s even
greater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with,
with businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their
Districts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I’ll tell you, it’s a pretty—the picture is, is not one of a slowing or, you know, a
really bad economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth
is stronger than other regions, but, overall, it’s—again, look at the aggregate data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The aggregate
data is—particularly PDFP, private domestic final purchases—is 2.6 percent, and that’s a good
indicator of private—of private demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we listen to all of that, and it does, does—I think
it’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Especially, you
know, it’s very hard—GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s just hard to measure
economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are a lot of—it’s just difficult to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I look at both, but I wouldn’t
say that the—that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s more mixed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, thanks for
taking our questions today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You have consistently said that the Fed does not consider politics in
making decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two
months before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so
close to the election is something the central bank knows “they shouldn’t be doing.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s
your response, and do you believe it’s possible to really remain apolitical with a September rate
cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 18 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I absolutely do, and I think it’s—first of all, we haven’t made any
decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say it this way: haven’t made any decision about any future meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t
know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I really
don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do know how we will make that assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what I do know.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if you take a step back, the current situation, again, is inflation has come down much
closer to our goal, and that’s happened while unemployment has remained low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re
very tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s at
each of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing
else—doing our part, whatever that part may be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re using our best thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re doing our best to understand the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we follow academics.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We follow the
many commentators who bless us with their commentary [laughter], but we don’t change
anything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all
times, not just some of the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll say this, too: We never use our tools to support or oppose a
political party, a politician, or any political outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The bottom line is, if we do our very best
to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we get it right, the
economy will be stronger.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’ll have price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People will find jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages will rise in
real terms.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everyone will benefit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what we believe, and that’s how we will always act.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can tell you this is how we think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on
the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 19 of 25

JO LING KENT.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just a quick follow-up—do your economic forecasts and models take
into account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris
and Trump, and, if so, how?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do not do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We absolutely do not do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t—
we don’t know who’s going to win.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know what they’re going to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t act as
though we know, and we just can’t do that, you know?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We basically—we have our forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not—we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to
make policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn’t happened yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We would
just—that would just be a line we would never cross.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re a nonpolitical agency.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t want to be involved in any—in politics in any way, so we wouldn’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nicholas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s
Magazine.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There hasn’t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If the
data do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you
get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Basically, are there meaningful differences in Committee members’ assessments of how much
more confidence is needed?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s—there are always meaningful differences.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do have a very robust
discussion of these things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re right that in, in most cases, people, if they feel heard and they
feel that they’ve—that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people, most
of the time, that’s going to be enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are dissents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s fine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, no one has a
veto.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We’ve had—we’ve had, you know, dissents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t had so many during the pandemic era,
and it just may be that we, we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get
things right, but before the pandemic, we had plenty of dissents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And dissents happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s part
of the process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s nothing wrong with dissents, and if it happens, it happens.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hello.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is a 50 basis point cut as a
first cut at all likely or even on the table?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I don’t want to say—I don’t want to be really specific
about what we’re going to do, but that’s, that’s not something we’re thinking about right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we haven’t made any decisions at all as of today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not to get into the minutes, but you said there was a real discussion today for
moving at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the
discussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, so, you know, the way the meeting is set up, the first day
there’s a discussion of financial stability because it’s every other meeting we have that, and then
we have an opportunity to comment on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then we have an economic go-round.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then,
this morning, we have the monetary policy go-round.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think in people’s economic or in
their monetary policy go-round, people express their views about this, and, you know, there’s a
range of views.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People—as you will know from the speeches that they give—people have
different ways of thinking about the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, in the minutes, we’ll lay this out in a
much—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there’s a range of perspectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
Page 21 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you know—but I do think that we are, we’re a consensus-driven organization.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People come
together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This was a unanimous—a unanimous decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, at the end, everyone, everyone
supported the outcome—not just the voters, but everyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would also say, some people
examined the possibility, you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but, overwhelmingly,
the sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending
on how the data come in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could
move at the next meeting—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>assuming inflation comes?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, assuming that the totality of the data supports such an
outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think that the time is, is—
it’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we—that we hope we get, then a reduction in our
policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg earlier this
month, which you probably saw, in which he said, “It might already be too late to fend off a
recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is he wrong?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is the judgment that we have to make, and we’re, we’re well
aware of the judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re—as I’ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against
the risk of going too late.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we go too soon, we can—we had a lot of advice, you know, to go
ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We said we needed to see
Page 22 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
more.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Then we saw some higher inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we’ve
seen the labor market move quite a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as I mentioned, I don’t think it needs to cool off
anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is,
of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s a difficult judgment to make, and what you see is the judgment of the
Committee is that that time is drawing near.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That time could be in September if, if the data
support that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And have the chances of a hard landing increased?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I, I don’t know whether they’ve increased.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think they’re low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
think this is—you don’t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply
weakening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s just not in the data right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What’s in the data right now is an economy
that’s growing at a—at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but, nonetheless,
inflation—sorry, unemployment is low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The data overall show a strong labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
that’s, that’s really what you see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not—it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s kind of what you would want to see, but, of course, the job is never done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
we’re, we’re watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I think we’re—if
we are to respond to weakness, we’re certainly, you know, well equipped to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s
not what we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What we’re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good
labor market and inflation coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you so much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the—in the minutes of the June meeting that
came out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some Fed officials
said maybe the Fed wasn’t as clear enough about its reaction function.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and when I talked to
Page 23 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the commentators who bless you with their comments [laughter], they say that they really don’t
have a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going
forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They don’t have a good sense of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there anything you can say, like how will we
judge that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I mean, I think the reality is that, that forecasters—and this
isn’t just the Fed by any means—forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the
strength of the economy last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we had to be pretty humble about, about giving
forward guidance about this, that, and the other thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We need to be pretty careful about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, when you’re saying you’re going to be data driven, of course, it’s always what
the data—how they affect the outlook and the balance of risks, but it’s—nobody has great vision
deep into the future.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of a reaction function, that’s a—that’s a long-time discussion that people have
had forever.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think people have understood for a long time, actually, that we were very focused
on bringing down inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nobody was really confused about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The data have, you know—
again, we’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Markets move
around on that—on the data, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not so much—it’s not really what we’re going to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
more just that the data keep coming in, and markets are very, very responsive to that data right
now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go to Jeff for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEFF COX.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m going to change gears on you just a little bit
from all of the rate talk and whatnot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year,
there hasn’t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you
could give us an update on where things are with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that considered a dead issue now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it
Page 24 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
still something that’s being discussed within the Committee, and what, what’s happening with
that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not something that comes up at all with the—in the FOMC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
more broadly, digital finance is an area that’s having—that has really significant implications for
payments generally, instant payments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, it’s something that’s going to really
change the way—it’s going to make more efficient and, hopefully, safer and all those things—
the way payments are made around the world.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we have people who are researching that
and trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as
a convener and as an operator, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of a CBDC, there’s really nothing new going on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s not much going on at
all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not—we don’t have the authority to issue a CB—a retail CBDC that’s available to the
public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not seeking that authority.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what we’re doing is keeping up with—keeping up
with developments there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing,
doing that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re really
not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re really just evaluating, you know, the story and what’s happening out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
think it’s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we
don’t have—on a CBDC, we don’t have any plan to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We would need to go to Congress, and we
have no plan to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not—no one here has decided that we think it’s a good idea yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 25 of 25</del></p>
