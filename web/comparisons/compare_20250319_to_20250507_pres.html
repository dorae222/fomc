Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 7, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-
run objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to
have risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to
respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Cough] Pardon me.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were likely driven by businesses bringing in
imports ahead of potential tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This unusual swing complicated GDP measurement last
quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the first quarter, the
same as last year’s pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated while
investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated
uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It remains to
be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged
155,000 per month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains
low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wage growth has continued to moderate,
while still outpacing inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the
labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor
market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat
elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the
12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices
rose 2.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, as reflected in
both market- and survey-based measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Survey respondents, including consumers, businesses,
and professional forecasters, point to tariffs as the driving factor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Beyond the next year or so,
however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent
inflation goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The tariff increases
announced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All of these policies are still
evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As economic
conditions evolve, we’ll continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based
on the incoming data, the outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Page 2 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to
generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The effects on inflation could be short lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It is
also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Avoiding that
outcome will depend on the size of the tariffs’ effect—tariff effects, on how long it takes for
them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation
expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent
a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As we act to
meet that obligation, we’ll balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are
in tension.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For the time being, we’re well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any
adjustments to our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review
of our monetary policy framework.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We focused on inflation dynamics and the implications for
our monetary policy strategy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference next
week.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Throughout this process, we’re open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take
on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We intend to wrap up the
review by late summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chair, for taking my
question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A lot has happened since the last meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There have been tariffs put on, tariffs taken
off, and meanwhile, there was a bill advancing in Congress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I just wonder if I could press
you on the last part of your statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you any closer now to deciding which side of the
mandate is going to need urgent care first?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, so, as we noted in our—in our statement—postmeeting
statement, we’ve judged that the risks to higher employment and higher inflation have both risen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this, by the way, of course, is compared to March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what we can say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think
we can say, you know, which way this will shake out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty
about, for example, where tariff policies are going to, to settle out and also, when they do settle
out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s
too early to know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I mean, ultimately, we think our policy rate is in—is in a good place
to stay as we await further clarity on tariffs and, ultimately, their implications for the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 25

STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hearing you describe what you’re looking for in terms of being able
to make a decision, it sounded like that’s a long-term process before you sound like you’re going
to be comfortable, or the Committee would be comfortable, to act on what the data’s telling you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think we know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I think—look where we are
today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We have an economy that, if you “look through,” you know, the sort of distortions in Q1
GDP, you’ve still got an economy that looks like it’s growing at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market
appears to be solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation is running just a bit above 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s an economy that’s
been resilient and is in good shape, and our policy is sort of modestly or moderately restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was last fall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we think that leaves us in a good
place to wait and see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t think we need to be in a hurry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think we can be patient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be watching the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The data may move quickly or slowly, but we do think
we’re in a good position, where we are, to, to let things evolve and become clearer in terms of
what should be the monetary policy response.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos for the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, there’s
naturally a lot of [inaudible] around 2021 in supply shocks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But there are some who argue that
the current situation has notable differences.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Energy costs are down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Housing imbalances look
nothing like they did four years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Labor demand appears to be gradually cooling, with wage
growth running below 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What do you see right now that could nourish higher inflation
beyond a rise in goods prices this year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the underlying inflation picture is, is good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s what you see,
which is inflation now running a bit above 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve had basically decent readings
in housing services and nonhousing services, which is a big part of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that part, I think is, is
moving along well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But there’s just so much that we don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—and we’re in a good position to
wait and see, is the thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t have to be in a hurry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is—has been resilient
and is doing fairly well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our policy is well positioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The costs of waiting to see further are
fairly low, we think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’ll, we’ll see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
Administration is entering into negotiations with many countries over tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll know more
with each week and month that goes by where—about where tariffs are going to land—you
know, land, and we’ll know what the effects will be when we start to see those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we
think we’ll be learning.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can’t tell you how long it will take.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, for now, it does seem like
it’s, it’s, it’s a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see and watch.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when you say that you don’t need to be in a hurry, does that mean
that—could the outlook change in such a way that a change in your stance could be warranted as
soon as your next meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, as I said, we’re—we are comfortable with our policy
stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think the right—we’re in the right place to wait and see how things evolve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
don’t feel like we need to be in a hurry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We feel like it’s appropriate to be patient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, when things develop—of course, we have a record of—we can move quickly when that’s
appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we think right now, the appropriate thing to do is to wait and see how things
evolve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s so much uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you talk to businesses or market participants or
forecasters, everyone is just—is just waiting to see how developments play out, and then we’ll be
able to make a better assessment of what the appropriate path for monetary policy is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re
not in that place, and, you know, as that develops—and I can’t really give you a time frame
on that.</strong></em></p>

JONNELLE MARTE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, many economists have been
pricing in higher odds of a recession, and several are noting that it is more difficult for the Fed to
cut rates preemptively, given the higher risks for higher inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, given the outlook, do you
still see a path for a soft landing, and what does that look like?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, let me say—I mean, so let’s, let’s, let’s look back and see
where we are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, go through 2024 up to the [present] day.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve had—we’ve had, you know,
unemployment in the low 4s for more than a year, we’ve had inflation coming down in the—now
in the mid-to-low 2s, and we’ve had an economy growing at 2½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that is—that is the
economy as we see it now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we
will see the—certainly, the risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
if that’s what we do see, if—and if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we
don’t know, then, then we will see—we won’t see further progress toward our goals, but we
might see a delay in that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think in the—you know, in our thinking, we would get—we would
never—we never do anything but keep achieving those goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what we would—at least for
the next, let’s say, year, we would—we would not be making progress toward those goals, again,
if that is—if that’s the way the tariffs shake out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The thing is, we don’t know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s so
much uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of the tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
terms of preemption, you know, I think you can look back at the 2019 cuts as preemptive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
wouldn’t say that what we did last fall was at all preemptive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If anything, it was a little late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
2019, we did cut three times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the situation was, you had a weakening economy, and you had
inflation at 1.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s a situation where you can move preemptively.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Now we have
inflation running above target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has been above target for four years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not so far above
target now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we have an expectation conditional on what happens that we’ll see upward
pressure on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at where forecasters are, they’re all forecasting an increase in
Page 7 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it makes it—and then we’ve also got, you know, forecasts of weakening in the
economy, and some have recession forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t make a—we don’t make—publish a
forecast about, about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t publish a forecast that assesses how likely a recession is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, in any case, it’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don’t
know what the right response to, to the data will be until we see more data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>How much weakness does the
Committee need to see, though, in the labor market and the economy more broadly to lower
interest rates again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is it about a certain increase in the unemployment rate over a period of
time, or perhaps a certain number of negative monthly job reports?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, how are you making
that assessment?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, so first of all, we don’t see that yet, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have
4.2 percent unemployment, good participation, wages behaving very well, participation, I
mentioned, at a good level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, with the labor market, we would look at the totality of
the—of the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’d look at the level of the unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’d look at the speed with
which it’s changing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We would look at the whole huge array of labor market data to, to get a
sense of whether conditions are really deteriorating or not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, at the same time, we’d be
looking at the other side of the mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We could be in a position of having to balance those
two things, which is, of course, a very—a difficult balancing judgment that we’d have to make.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On that point about balancing, I mean, you’ve mentioned that the
Committee would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the time it would take to
kind of get back to that point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what does that mean in practice?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, how much of that
assessment will be rooted in a forecast, versus data dependence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would be a combination of the two.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, let’s just say this is
a—this would be a complicated and challenging judgment that we would have to make if—and
this is—we’re not in this situation, but the situation is if the two goals are in tension.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So let’s say
that unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way and so is inflation—not the situation
we’re in—hypothetically.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they’re
expected to be from the goals, what’s the expected time to get back to their goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’d look at
all those things and make a difficult judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s in our framework.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s always been in
our thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s—we haven’t had—we haven’t faced that question in a very long
time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, again, difficult, difficult judgment to make, and not one that we face today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
we may never face it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we have to be keeping it in our thinking now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we had
the CPI report that came out that showed, month over month, the first increase in inflation in
about three years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The jobs report—you said “solid”—that we saw.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, we have
those new tariffs that we’re living under.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, given this, should the Federal Reserve be cutting
rates at all this year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s going to depend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you have to just take a step
back and realize this is—this is why we are where we are, is, you know, we are going to need to
see how this evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are cases in which it wouldn’t, and we just don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Until we know more about
how this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment, for—and
for, for inflation, I couldn’t confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 9 of 25

EDWARD LAWRENCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, following on that, just, you know—so then how does
President Trump calling on you personally as well as the Federal Reserve to make rate cuts affect
your decision today and affect your job difficulty?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>[0:18:00]
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Doesn’t affect our—doing our job at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we—you know, we’re
always going to do the same thing—which is, we’re going to use our tools to foster maximum
employment and price stability for the benefit of the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re always going to
consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s it, that’s all we’re
going to consider.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering—I mean, given the complexity about the first-quarter GDP and what lies ahead,
I’m just wondering what your intuition tells you about the underlying direction of the economy
right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many of your colleagues have said they feel growth is slowing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If so, do you have
any sense of by how much, to what degree the slowdown may be?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What does your gut tell you
about how things are evolving out there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is
extremely elevated [laughter] and that the downside risks have increased.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The risk is—as we
pointed out in our statement, the risks—the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation
have risen, but they haven’t materialized yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They really haven’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not, really not in the
data yet, so that—and that tells me more than by intuition because I think—I think it’s obvious,
actually, that the right thing for us to do is to—we’re in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our policy’s in a very
good place, and the right thing to do is, is await further clarity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I—you know, there’s—
usually, things clarify, and that—the appropriate direction becomes clear.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what usually
Page 10 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right now, it’s very hard to say what that would be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the meantime, the
economy is doing fine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our policy isn’t—you know, it’s not highly restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s somewhat
restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was in, you know, last summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we
think it’s—we think it’s in a good place, and we think the appropriate thing is for us to wait and
see and get more clarity about, about the direction of the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, let me press you on this idea of the economy being fine
right now, because, reading the Beige Book very closely the last time around, there was a lot of,
you know, negative stuff, negative sentiment that was in there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I know that everybody’s
looking at soft data right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned it yourself—that the sentiment’s sour.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the
Beige Book was talking about, you know, the beginnings of layoffs in some industries, prices
rising in, in some places, and an awful lot of investment decisions being, being pushed to the
sideline.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Doesn’t that point to a slowdown?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It may well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just hasn’t shown up yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, we all
look at all these sentiments and read many, many individual comments just to get a better feel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it—you know, businesses and households very broadly are concerned and, you know,
postponing economic decisions of various kinds.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, yes, if that continues and nothing,
nothing happens to sort of alleviate those concerns, then you would expect that to begin to show
up in economic data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It wouldn’t maybe show up overnight, but it would show up over weeks
and months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that may be what happens, but it hasn’t happened yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, there are
things that can happen that will—that will change that narrative.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, they haven’t happened,
but it’s possible to imagine things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in the meantime, yes, we’re watching it extremely
carefully, like everyone is, but don’t see really much evidence of it in the actual economic data
yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And by the way, consumers keep spending, credit card spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—you know, it’s

still—it’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment
on the part of people and businesses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
Fed’s been criticized recently by a former Governor for what he calls “mission creep”—you take
on more problems, use more tools, and then end up building tools to deal with the fallout of those
tools, which then makes it a given that you will act more aggressively in the future.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that a fair
critique, and is that something you would be looking at in your framework review?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, say that critique again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That the Fed has been involved in mission creep—gets involved in
using too many new tools to deal with problems and to go too far.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that something that—the
critique was based around the fact that you did QE and QE and QE and—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Oh, okay.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MICHAEL MCKEE. —</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>and went beyond the narrow confines of your mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—well, I mean, there are a couple—that’s not really beyond the
confines of our mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—look, I would say this: We—you know, we did things—essentially,
we were on an emergency footing for a couple of years in the pandemic, and it’s very fair and
very welcome for people to look back over what we did and say, “Hey, you could have done this
better and different.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And one thing we hear a lot is, we could have explained the QE a little
better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We did think we were explaining it in real time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I completely accept the, the thought that
we could have explained it better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a lot of thinking that we went on too long with QE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
can tell you that the reason we did was, we were—we were concerned that we didn’t want a
tightening of—a sharp tightening in financial conditions at a time when we thought the economy
Page 12 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was still vulnerable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we did hold on for a long time to QE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we, of course, tapered
and everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then we immediately went into QT, and, you know, we’ve—we’re down a
couple of trillion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I get the—that, you know, we, we certainly, with the benefit of hindsight,
could have tapered earlier or faster.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s absolutely right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But this is all very welcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
know, it’s, it’s—you know, we knew, doing this in real time, that we weren’t going to get it
perfect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And those kind of—those kind of, you know, after-action kind of looks are essential.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re doing the same thing in—you know, in our review, so—on some issues.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There—the other part of that critique is that you’ve taken on topics
that are outside of the mandate, such as climate change and trying to ensure that certain groups
are benefited by your economic policies in terms of employment, et cetera.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, okay, on climate, you’ve heard me say over and over again that
we will not be climate policymakers and that our role on climate is a very, very narrow one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
I think—I think that’s what we’ve done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve done really very little on climate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can say
that was—that little bit that we’ve done was too much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I wouldn’t want to give any
impression that, that, you know, we take—that we’ve taken climate in and it’s something that
we’re spending a lot of time and energy on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have very, very narrow things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
did one thing, one guidance for the banks, and then we did one—a one-time stress analysis,
climate stress analysis, and that’s it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we dropped out of the Network for
Greening the Financial System.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we didn’t do much on climate, but—and I do think, and I’ve
said this publicly several times, I think it’s, it’s a real danger for us to try to take on a mandate
like that, which is very narrow application to our work.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, the risk is, if you—if
you go for things that are really not on your mandate, you know, then why are you independent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I think that’s a very fair question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I do think we’ve done a whole lot less on
climate than some people seem to think we did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Anyway, that’s what I think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 13 of 25

<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Should you have taken on the question of bringing unemployment
rates down for specific categories?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, we said—what we said was that we
never targeted any unemployment rate for individual racial or demographic groups.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What we
said was that maximum employment was a broad and inclusive goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I think what we meant
by that was, we’re going to consider the totality of the country as we look at our maximum-
employment goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, we were never going to target on any individual group with that,
but I think some people, you know, wanted to hear it that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s not at all what we
meant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—so that’s just not a correct reading of our—but I can see how, you know, maybe
people found that confusing, and, you know, we have to take that into consideration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jo Ling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JO LING KENT.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our questions today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m Jo Ling
Kent with CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve said, “Wait and see” and “The economy is doing fine” today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the impact of tariffs are already showing up at the ports.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Businesses big and small are telling
us that they feel it, and most importantly, consumers say they feel it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the challenges are here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there’s no waiting and seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For Main Street, what is the breaking point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What would
have to happen to prompt a rate cut specifically?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you know, so we really don’t see in the data yet big economic
effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We see—we see sentiment, their concerns that higher prices may be coming, or things
like that, but—so people, they’re worried now about inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re worried about, you
know, a shock from the tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But they really haven’t—that shock hasn’t hit yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Okay, so, you
know, we’re going to be looking at not just the sentiment data, but also the real economic data as
we assess what it is we should do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And remember, we’re—there will be two effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One of
them would be weakening economy—weakening economic activity, which translates into higher
Page 14 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployment, and the other would be potentially higher inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, to say it again, the
timing, the scope, the scale, and the persistence of those effects are very, very uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s
not at all clear what the appropriate response for monetary policy is at this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re—
you know—and by the way, our policy’s in a good place, so we think we can wait and move
when it is clear what the right thing to do is; really not at all clear what it is we should do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So
people are feeling stress and concern, but unemployment hasn’t gone up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job creation is fine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wages are in good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, people are not—layoffs are—people are not getting laid
off at high levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, initial claims for unemployment are not increasing, you know, in
any kind of impressive way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the economy itself is still, you know, in solid shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just a quick follow-up: President Trump now says he does not plan to
remove you as Chair.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When you heard that, what did you think?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t have anything more for you on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve pretty much
covered that issue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I
just wanted to follow up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Earlier, it sounded like you said it was unclear how the Fed—you
know, what kind of interest rate decisions you will make later this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So does that—you
know, in March, there was guidance that two cuts might happen, you know, two cuts were
penciled in for this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that now—that guidance from the last press conference, has that
been overtaken by events at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we don’t do a Summary of Economic Projections at
every meeting, as you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do it every other meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so this was the meeting when
we didn’t do it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I—you know, we don’t also kind of poll people, so I really—I really
wouldn’t want to try to make a specific projection for where we are relative to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will—in
Page 15 of 25

six weeks, we have the June meeting, and you’ll have another SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not going to hazard a
guess here today what—as to what it would be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, what I would say is that we think our
policy rate is in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think it leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to
potential developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s where we are, and that—depending on the way things play out,
that could include rate hikes—sorry, rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it could include us holding where we
are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just are going to need to see, you know, how things play out before we make those
decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow up on that, I mean, when you
address the issue of how the Fed would handle both rising unemployment and rising inflation,
how are you thinking about the fact that addressing one could exacerbate the other?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So a rate cut
to reduce unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How does that—how do you
handle those challenges?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you just captured the—this is the issue with the two goals
being in tension.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a very challenging question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, there can be a case in which one goal is
very far—one variable’s very far from its goal, much farther than the other.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if so, you
concentrate on that one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, frankly, that was the case—well, it wasn’t a case where they were
really in tension.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But if you go back to 2022, it was very clear that we needed to focus on
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market was also super tight, so it wasn’t really a tradeoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, if—I
think you know what our—what our framework document says.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It says we’ll look at how far
each goal—each variable is from its goal and also we’ll factor in the time it would take to get
there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, that’s going to be a—potentially, a very difficult judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the data
could break in a way that it’s not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I just don’t think we know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The data could
easily favor one or the other.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And right now, there’s no way to—no need to make a choice and
no real basis for doing so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 25

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask, Congress is
currently debating spending cuts alongside expending—extending the tax cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I know
you’ve talked many times about how the path of the debt is unsustainable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But given that we’re
also talking right now about the economy slowing, potentially even recession, I was just
wondering, is there a danger that spending cuts now could slow growth a lot more?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we don’t give Congress fiscal advice.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—they’re going
to do—we take what they do as a given, and we put it in our models and in our assessment of the
economy, so I wouldn’t want to, you know, speculate on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I think we do know that
the debt is on an unsustainable level—on an unsustainable path—not on an unsustainable level,
but an unsustainable path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s on Congress to figure out how to get us back on a sustainable
path, and, you know, it’s not up to us to give them advice.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, do you think that they should take macroeconomic
conditions into account as they look at this?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think they don’t need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal
policy any more than we need their advice on monetary policy. [</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Andrew.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>ANDREW ACKERMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Andrew Ackerman with the
Washington Post.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In your Jackson Hole comments last year, you said you would not welcome
further cooling in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate then was 4.2 percent, which
is what it is now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Forecasters—many forecasters now predict a higher jobless rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>How has
your tolerance for weakening labor market conditions changed compared to a year ago?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it was quite a different situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What was happening last year is
that over the space of six, eight, seven months, the unemployment rate went up by almost a full
Page 17 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know,
everywhere, people were talking about downside risks to the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time,
payroll job numbers were getting softer and softer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So there was a really obvious concern about
downside risk to the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so at Jackson Hole and then in September, you know, we
wanted to address that forthrightly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We wanted to show that we were there for the—I mean, we
had been there for inflation for a couple of years, and we wanted to show also that we’re there
for the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it was important that we send that signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Fortunately, since then, the
labor market has really—and the unemployment rate have really been moving sideways at a level
that is, you know, well in the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that
concern has gotten a lot less.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, you know, you’re at 4.2 percent unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we
were in a very different situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And now we have a situation where, you know, the risks to
higher inflation and higher unemployment have both gone up, as we noted in our statement, and
we’ve got to monitor both of those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We actually have a potential situation where there may be a
tradeoff or tension between the two potentially.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t have it yet, and we may not have it,
but that’s what we [may] have, and that’s why I think it’s a very different, different situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I mean, I guess I want to follow up by asking how much of
a rise in the jobless rate you would—you could tolerate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can’t give you a—you know, a—I’m not going to try to give you a
specific number.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I’ll just say, we’ve got—we have to now be looking at both variables and
which of them is, is, you know, demanding—if one of them is demanding our focus more than
the other, that would tell us what to do with policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If they’re more or less this, you know,
equally distant and equally—or not distant, then we don’t have to make that assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
know, the assessment is, you wait.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m not going to try to be really specific about what we
need to see in terms of the number.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if—look, if we did see, you know, significant
Page 18 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deterioration in the labor market, of course that’s one of our two variables, and we would look to
be able to support that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’d hope that it wasn’t also coming at a time when inflation was
getting very bad.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, we’re speculating here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know any
of these things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very hypothetical.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re just going to have to wait and see how the—how it
plays out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of getting some clarity, we’ve
got some talks at the weekend in Geneva between the U.S. and China.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A lot of economists are
ask—are attaching an awful lot of importance to how—what we hear from those talks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How
much importance are you attaching to them in terms of judging what will happen to the U.S.
economy going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just in a similar vein, you know, some economists are saying it’s
days, not weeks, that we have until we start to put the U.S. economy at risk of seeing a sort of
pandemic here, with shortages and higher prices, if we don’t kind of soothe relations between the
U.S. and China.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it would be good to have your view on that, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, these are not talks that we’re in any way involved in,
so I really can’t comment directly on them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but what I will say is this: You know, we
had—coming out of the March meeting, we, we—the public generally had an assessment of
where tariffs were going.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then April 2 happened, and it was really substantially larger than
anticipated in the forecasts that I’ve seen and in our forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and now we—and now we
have a different—we’re in a new phase where—it seems to be we’re entering a new phase where
the Administration is entering into beginning talks with a number of our important trading
partners.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—that has the potential to change the picture materially or not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I
think it’s going to be very important how that shakes out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I—you know, we simply have to
Page 19 of 25

wait and see how it works out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It certainly could change the picture, and we’re mindful of not
trying to make conclusive judgments about what will happen at a time when the—you know,
when the facts are changing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And just on the fall in shipping volumes from China over these
tensions, I mean, do you share that concern that we could start seeing goods shortages and higher
prices in the coming weeks if this isn’t resolved very quickly?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I don’t want to get my—we’re not—we shouldn’t be
involved, even verbally, in questions about the timing of these things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, we’re—of course,
we follow all that data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see the shipping data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see all that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, ultimately, this is for the
Administration to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is—you know, this is their mandate, not ours.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I know they’re—
as you can see, they’re, again, having—beginning to have talks with many nations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that has
the potential to change the picture materially, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The
volume of imported goods increased significantly in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Do you think the decision
could cause a delay in the impact of tariff on inflation, and does this mean that it will take a
longer time to reduce uncertainty?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The decision we made today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Which decision?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the future decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the volume of imports—

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KOSUKE TAKAMI. —</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>imported goods has increased significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the impact of the
imported inflation may delay.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, what is the impact to your future decision?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, so, I mean, I think we—I think we think that the—you know,
there was a big spike in imports—right?—very big, historically large, really, and—to beat tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 20 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And now that should actually reverse so that it’s—you know, it’s the difference between—it’s
exports minus imports, so—and imports were huge, and so then it conveyed a very negative
contribution to U.S. GDP—annualized GDP in the first quarter, as we all know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that could, in
the second quarter, be reversed so that we have, you know, an unusually large contribution to—
unusually positive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s very likely as imports drop sharply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You could also have—you know,
very likely you’ll have restatements of the—of the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’ll turn out that consumer
spending was higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It will turn out that inventories were higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so you’ll see—you’ll see
those data revised up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It may actually go into the third quarter, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I think it’s going—
this whole process is going to, a little bit, make it harder to make a clean assessment of U.S.
demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mentioned private domestic final purchases, which doesn’t have inventories,
government, or—inventories, government.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Anyway, it’s a cleaner read on private demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But
that, that, too, probably was flattered a little bit by—you know, by strong demand for imports to
be tariffed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that might overstate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a really good reading, 3 percent PDFP in the first
quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That might actually overstate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s not really going to—I don’t think it’s going to
affect our decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will just say, though, that it’s a little confusing and it’s probably less
confusing to us than it would be to the general public as we try to explain this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s
complicated, and, you know, GDP is sending a signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>PDFP is sending a signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a little bit
confusing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think we understand what’s going, and it’s not really going to change things
for us.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I guess, you
know, we talked about some of the indications of potential layoffs, price hikes, an economic
slowdown all being evident in the soft data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m curious why the Fed needs to wait for that to
translate into hard data to, you know, make any type of monetary policy decision, especially if
Page 21 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the hard data is not as timely or might be warped by tariff-related effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you worried that
the soft data might be some sort of false warning?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s—look, the—look at the state of the economies.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The
labor market is solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation is low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can afford to be patient as things unfold.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s no
real cost to our waiting at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also, the sense of it—the sense of it is, we’re not sure what
the right thing will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, there should be some increase in inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>There should be
some increase in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those call for different responses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so until we know—
potentially call for different responses—and so, you know, until we know more, we have the
ability to wait and see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it seems to be a pretty clear decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everyone on the Committee
supported waiting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that’s why we’re waiting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just a very quick follow-up: There was this sort of vibe
session, if you will, where the sentiments expressed in soft data did not translate into the hard
economic data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you—how are you thinking about that when interpreting some of the signs
in the softer survey data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I think, going back a number of years, the link between
sentiment data and consumer spending has been weak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not been a strong link at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the
other hand, we haven’t had a move of this, you know, speed and size.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it wouldn’t be the case
that we’re looking at this and just completely dismissing it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s another reason to wait and
see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re right that we had a couple of years during the pandemic where people were
saying—just very downbeat surveys and going out and spending money.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that can happen,
and that may happen to some degree here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is an outsized change in
sentiment, though, and so none of us are looking at this and saying that we’re sure one way or
the other.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 22 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MATT EGAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you mentioned earlier
that you’re monitoring the shipping data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we have seen in the shipping data that imports
from China into the Port of Los Angeles have plunged.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that has raised concerns about
potential shortages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What tools, if any, does the Fed have to ensure that prices and inflation
expectations don’t get out of hand if tariffs do cause significant supply chain disruptions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I mean, we don’t have, you know, the kind of tools that are good at
dealing with supply chain problems.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t have that at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a—that’s a job for the
Administration and for the private sector more than anything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, what we can do with
our interest rate tool is, we can support—be more or less supportive of demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—
that’d be a very inefficient way to try to fix supply chain problems.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, you know, we don’t
see—we don’t see the inflation yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, of course, reading the same stories and watching the
same data as everybody else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, right now, we see inflation, you know, kind of
moving sideways at a fairly low level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up on that, President Trump has indicated that he will
likely name a replacement for you when your term as Chair expires next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But your position
on the Board runs through January 2028, I believe.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you consider remaining on the Fed
Board even if you’re no longer Chair?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t have anything for you on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My whole focus is on—
and my colleagues’ focus is all on, you know, trying to navigate this tricky passage we’re in right
now, trying to make the right decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we want to make the best decisions for the
people that we serve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we think about day and night.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is a challenging
situation, and that’s, that’s 100 percent of our focus right now.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 19, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved
closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also made the technical decision to slow the pace of decline
in the size of our balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say about these decisions after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year,
with GDP rising at 2.3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Recent indications, however, point to a moderation in consumer
spending following the rapid growth seen over the second half of 2024.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Surveys of households
and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It remains to be
seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In our Summary of
Economic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year,
somewhat lower than projected in December, and to rise a bit below 2 percent over the next two
years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged 200,000 per
month over the past three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains low and has
held in a narrow range for the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The jobs-to-workers gap has held steady for several
months.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in
the pandemic recovery.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor
Page 1 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
market are broadly in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary
pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end
of this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Some
near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see this in both
market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are
mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of
longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median
projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, a
little higher than projected in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In 2027, the median projection is at our 2 percent
objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Looking
ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is the net effect of these
policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>While there
have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty
around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we parse the incoming
information, we’re focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As
Page 2 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the
target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,
and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward—an admittedly challenging exercise at this time in light of
considerable uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of next
year, unchanged from December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>While these individual forecasts are always subject to
uncertainty, as I noted, uncertainty today is unusually elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, these projections
are not a Committee plan or a decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is not on a preset course.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy
stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If
the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward
2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy
accordingly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties
that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At today’s meeting, we also decided to slow the pace of decline in our balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Since we began balance sheet runoff, our securities holdings have declined by more than $2
trillion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>While market indicators continue to suggest that the quantity of reserves remains
abundant, we have seen some signs of increased tightness in money markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Beginning in
Page 3 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
April, the monthly cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $25 billion to $5 billion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run,
we are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This action has no implications for our
intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the
medium term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Committee also continued its discussions as part of our five-year review of our
monetary policy framework.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>At this meeting, we focused on labor market dynamics and our
maximum-employment goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we have indicated, our review will include outreach and public
events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a
research conference in May.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical
feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand
that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for your time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
two things on sort of the real side here, one inflation and then—and then GDP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much of the
Page 4 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
higher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs, and since the policy path remains the same,
are you effectively reading this as a one-time price-level shock?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, so how much of it is, is tariffs?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say that it is going to
be very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs
and from, from other—and that’s already the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You may have seen that goods inflation
moved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Trying to track that back to
actual tariff increases, given what was tariffed and what was not—very, very challenging.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
some of it—the, the answer is clearly some of it—a good part of it is, is coming from tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
we’ll be—we’ll be working, and so will other forecasters, to try to find the best possible way to
separate nontariff inflation from tariff inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the, the—your, your sort of looking-through question, too soon to say about
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As, as I’ve mentioned, it, it can be the case that it’s appropriate sometimes to look through
inflation if it’s going to go away quickly without action by, by us, if it’s transitory.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that can
be the case in the case of, of tariff inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that would depend on the, the tariff inflation
moving through fairly quickly and would depend critically, as well, on inflation expectations
being well anchored—longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I, I guess I’m looking at the obvious here—the fact that
the policy path doesn’t change at all and inflation is unchanged in the outyears also.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Doesn’t that
imply you all have basically decided that there is no signal here and that it’s just going to—we’re
back to “transitory” again?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think—I think that’s kind of the base case, but, as I said, it’s—
we really can’t know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to have to see how things actually, actually work out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the fact that there wasn’t much change—I think that’s, that’s partly because, you know, you
Page 5 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see—you see weaker growth but higher inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They kind of offset.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, frankly, a little
bit of inertia when it—when it comes to changing something in this highly uncertain
environment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you’re—you, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you
just say, “Maybe I’ll stay where I am.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You just
described inflation expectations as well anchored, but has your confidence in that assessment
changed at all, given the increase in certain measures and the high degree of uncertainty
expressed by businesses, households, and forecasters?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So our inflation expectations—of course, we do monitor inflation
expectations very, very carefully—basically, every source we can find, and, you know—short-
term, long-term, households, businesses, forecasters, market-based.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think the picture,
broadly, is this: You do see increases widely in short-term inflation expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And people
who fill out surveys and answer, you know, questionnaires are pointing to tariffs about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If
you look—in the survey world, if you look a little further out, you, you really—you really don’t
see much in the way of an increased longer-term inflation—inflation expectations are mostly
well anchored, if you look at the [series maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of] New York,
for example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then you have market based, and it’s the same pattern.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, people and
markets are pricing in and, and breakevens, some higher inflation over the next year must be
related to tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know from the surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if you look out five years or five-year, five-
year forward, you’ll see that breakevens have—are either flat or, actually, slightly down in the
case of a longer-term one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So we look at that, and we will be watching all of it very, very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do not take
anything for granted.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s at the very heart of our framework: anchored inflation
expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what—that’s what you see right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and how much weight do you put on the deterioration in
consumer confidence surveys?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You said recently that this is perhaps not the best indication of
future spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I’m curious, you know, what you think is behind this deterioration and, and
to what extent it could be a leading indicator for hard data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let’s start with the hard data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we do see pretty
solid hard data still.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So growth looks like it’s maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending
moderating a bit, but still at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Unemployment’s 4.1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job creation, most
recently, has been at a healthy level.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has started to move up now, we think partly in
response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s the hard data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, it’s a solid picture.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The, the survey data, [in the case of] both
household and businesses, show significant rise in uncertainty and significant concerns about
downside risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So how do we think about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—that is the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned the other day, as you pointed out, the relationship between survey data
and actual economic activity hasn’t been very tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There have been plenty of times where
people are saying very down—downbeat things about the economy and then going out and
buying a new car.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we don’t know that that will be the case here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will be watching very
carefully for signs of weakness in the real data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course we will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I, I—you know, given
where we are, we think our policy’s in a good place to react to, to what comes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think
that the right thing to do is, is to wait here for, you know, for greater clarity about, about what,
what the economy’s doing.</del></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Chair Powell, Chair
Greenspan once defined price stability as, as an environment in which inflation is so low and
stable over time that it doesn’t materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Can
you say that today we have that price stability—that households and businesses are ignoring
price growth, or do you see, by an advanced psychology, big changes in inventories and surveys
that show consumers, at least in the short run, expect higher inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I do like that definition a lot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In fact, I used it at the recent
conference where I spoke.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think a world where, where people can make their daily
economic decisions, and businesses, and they’re not having to think about the possibility of
significantly high inflation—we know inflation will bounce around.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s, that is price
stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say we were at
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation was running around 2½ percent for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I do think with the arrival of, of
the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed, if the SEP doesn’t really show further
downward progress on inflation this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that, that’s really due to the tariffs coming in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, delayed, but if you look at our forecast, we do see ourselves getting back into the low 2s in
’26 and then down to 2 [percent] by ’27—of course, highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I see progress having,
having been made toward that, and then progress in the future.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that progress is probably
delayed for the time being.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If that’s the case, why are there cuts in the SEP for 2025?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, again, people wrote down two cuts the last time, and they look
at—they look at the—you know, the—and they wrote down, you know, meaningful decline in
growth out from 2.1 to 1.7 in 2025, a tick up in the unemployment rate, so not much there, but
Page 8 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
core inflation up by three-tenths.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so those two kind of—those kind of balance each other
out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So people—not everybody, but, on balance, people wrote down similar numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
changes aren’t that big.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The other—the other factor, though, as I mentioned, is just really high uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What
would you write down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s just—it’s really hard to know how this is going to work out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, we think our policy’s in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think it’s a good place where we can
move in the direction that—where we need to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in the meantime, we, we—it’s, it’s really
appropriate to wait for further clarity, and, of course, you know, the costs of doing that, given
that the economy is still solid, are very low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So with near 4 percent unemployment rate, that should be low enough to bring people
in from the sidelines in terms of hiring.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re seeing the hiring rates have been stuck at
2023, 2024 levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, what’s going on there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so that’s a feature of the—has been for some time, a feature of
this labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You have pretty high participation, accounting for aging.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’ve got wages
that are consistent with 2 percent inflation, assuming that we’re going to keep getting, you know,
relatively high productivity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve got unemployment, you know, pretty close to its natural
level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But job—the hiring rate is quite low, but so is the layoff rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the, the—you look at
initial claims or layoffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re not seeing people losing their jobs, but you’re seeing that
people who don’t have a job having to wait longer and longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the question is,
which way does that break?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we were to see a meaningful increase in layoffs, then that would
probably translate fairly quickly into unemployment, because people are—you know, it’s, it’s
Page 9 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a—it’s not a big hiring market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve been watching that, and it’s just not in the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
hasn’t happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we’ve had is, is a low-firing, low-hiring situation, and it seems to be in
balance now for, you know, for the last six, seven, eight months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s where we are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s
healthy levels of job creation, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, overall, it’s a labor market that’s in balance, and, you
know, we, we watch it very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So then, have we seen the Administration—the new
Administration’s policies in the economic numbers yet?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And when do you anticipate that
happening?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In labor?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or in, in other—?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In labor and inflation, just across the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Have we
started to see the new policies take effect in the numbers?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, you know, only in a—kind of an early way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s only been
a few months, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, for example, the, the layoffs that are happening here are, you
know, they’re certainly meaningful to the people involved, and they may be meaningful to a
particular neighborhood or region or area, but at the national level, they’re not—they’re not
significant yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know what—where that—how far that will go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll, we’ll find out much more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mentioned that—you, you saw it—we’ve had two, two very strong goods inflation
readings in the last two months, which is very unexpected, and, I think, hard to trace it to specific
tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it must have—it must have something to do with—it’s either noise and it’ll come
back, and that—that’s very possible, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if it is persistent, then it must be to do with, you
know, people buying ahead of tariffs, or raising prices ahead of tariffs, and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That—those kinds of things happen, and they’re very, very hard to capture because so much of it
Page 10 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is indirect.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>A great example is there—washing machines were tariffed in the last, last round of
tariffs, and prices went up, but prices also went up on, on dryers, which were not tariffed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the
manufacturers just, you know, they just kind of followed the crowd and, and raised it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So things
happen very indirectly, and so there’ll be a lot of work done in the coming months to, to try to
trace all that through.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, ultimately, though, it’s too soon to be seeing significant effects in
economic data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CRAIG TORRES.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
said transitory price increases from tariffs are the base case—transitory is the base case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wasn’t
it the base case last time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And didn’t the FOMC forecast lower inflation ahead last time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
wasn’t the lesson that it quickly got into services, haircuts, daycare, everything else?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I’m
just wondering why the nine aren’t taking that on board and are cutting twice this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When you say “last time,” are you talking about the last—
CRAIG TORRES.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Pandemic, yes—during the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You could have been talking about the last time there were tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In which case, the inflation was, was transitory.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No—of course, we’re well aware of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know,
it’s, it’s still the truth, if, if there’s an inflationary impulse that’s going to go away on its own, it’s
not the right policy to, to tighten policy, because by the time you have your effect, you’re—you
know, you’re—an effect that by—by design, you are lowering economic activity and
employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if that’s not necessary, you don’t want to do it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In real time, as we know, it’s
Page 11 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
hard to make that judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and, and we’re well aware, you know, of what happened,
obviously, with, with the pandemic inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, I mean, we have to look at this as a—as a
different situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s, there are differences and similarities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s a different time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, we haven’t had real price stability fully reestablished yet, and we have to keep that in
mind.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, you know, we also have—we hear that people are very reluctant to take on—to, you
know, to, to allow prices to go up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, we hear that businesses are intending to
pass many of these prices through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s hard to say how this is going to work out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve, Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking my question,
Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Bank of Canada in its last policy statement said, “Monetary policy cannot
offset the impacts of a trade war.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What it can and must do is ensure that higher prices do not
lead to ongoing inflation.”</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wonder if that kind of reflects your own sense of prioritization,
faced with higher prices and weaker growth—that the idea is, you have to take care of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know—so we, we have two goals, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We have maximum
employment and price stability, and we have to balance those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there can be
situations in which they are in tension, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we have, actually have a provision in our—in
our consensus statement that says what we should do in that case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a very challenging, you
know, situation for, for any central bank, and certainly for us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, what we say that we’ll do
is, we’ll, we’ll look how far each of those two goals is—each of those two measures is from its
goal, and then we’ll ask how long we think it might take to get back to the goal for each of them,
and we’ll make a judgment, because our, you know, our tools work in one direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re
either tightening or loosening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s a very challenging situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let me say, we don’t have
that situation right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not what the—that’s not where the economy is at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also
Page 12 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not where the forecast is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know any mainstream forecast that really shows significant
problems like that, so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, just to follow up, yesterday the UCLA Anderson Forecast said
there’s—a high probability of a recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where, where do you stand on whether or not the
slowdown you’re seeing creates a higher probability or concern that you may have on recession?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, there’s always an unconditional probability—possibility
of, of a recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It might be broadly in the range of one in four at any time, if you look back
through, through the years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It—there could be, within 12 months, a one in four chance of a
recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the question is, is whether that—whether this current situation, those possibilities
are elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will say this: We don’t—we don’t make such a forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at outside
forecasts, forecasters have, have generally raised—a number of them have raised their possibility
of a—of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate levels—you know, still in the
region of, of the traditional, because they were extremely low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you go back two months,
people were saying that the, the likelihood of a recession was extremely low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, has moved up,
but it’s not high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As
you know, I guess, last night the—President Trump fired two members of the Federal Trade
Commission, an independent agency, and this could cause the kind of legal fight about the
Administration’s power to fire independent people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If those firings stand, is that a threat to the
Fed’s independence?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could he do the same thing to the Fed Board?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 13 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think I, I did answer that question in this very room some time
ago, and I, I [have] no desire to change that answer and have nothing new for you on that today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I just—okay, well, maybe I’ll have another
mulligan. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter] As you know, I, I wanted to go back to the consumer sentiment,
particularly the inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the summer of
2022, you cited the rise in the long-term inflation expectations in that index as the reason that
you went big with a three-quarter-point hike.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I know you’ve—I mean, you’ve talked about
all the different measures now, but you seem to not be placing the same weight on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
I’m just wondering, are you dismissing that, what we saw last week from the University of
Michigan, or does that carry the same weight as it did in the past?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I mentioned it back then, but in no way did I place a huge
weight on it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it, it—that was an ex post story, but it wasn’t the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was a
preliminary reading, and so is this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s also—this is—that, that Michigan, the one you’re
referring to, the longer-term thing—you know, we look at it, and we don’t dismiss data that we
don’t like.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we force ourselves to look at it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it is an outlier compared to market-based
and compared to other survey-based assessments of longer-run inflation expectations, so we’ve
got to keep that in mind.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I—again, I, I would just say, we look at—we look at all of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that one—that one’s kind of an outlier, but, you know, nonetheless, we, we take notice of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There is a
worry on Wall Street that when you say you want to study the net effect of the fiscal policies, we
may see on the economy that you would end up waiting too long and be “behind the curve” in
Page 14 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
responding to any downturn.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How can you reassure people that you can spot a problem early
enough, unless you decide to be preemptive?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, look, we’re, we’re aware of the—we’re well aware of how
things are going to evolve and the time frames and all that, and, you know, we will—we will use
our tools to foster achievement of our goals to the—to the best we can.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, we’re
going to try to be timely with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For right now, the hard data are pretty solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we are
obviously aware of the soft sentiment data and high uncertainty, and we’re watching that
carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think it’s a, a good time for us to wait for further clarity before we consider
adjusting our, our policy stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you think it’s going to be hard to get clarity in a “government
by tweet”?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, do you have a, a feeling that at some point you actually will have a forecast
you can trust?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, I think we will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just—it’s hard to say when that will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
know, we’re—these decisions are going to be made, and they’re going to be implemented, and
then we’ll know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At that point, we’ll know what the decisions are, and we’ll have to make
assessments then about their, their implications for the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those things will happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A
lot of them will happen over the course of, you know, in coming months, certainly over the
course of this year, and we’ll be adapting as we go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>RACHEL SIEGEL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank
you for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the beginning, you were talking about separating the signal
from the noise, and tariff inflation from nontariff inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you “walk us through” what that
Page 15 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
looked like over the last couple of months—if there were specifics, from the January meeting to
now, that helped you make those distinctions?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when we say “separating the signal from the noise,” that’s just a
way of saying that things are highly uncertain and that, you know, you’re reading about
developments—the news is full of developments of tariffs being put on and taken off and things
like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s—some of that is noise in the sense that it’s, it’s not really telling you anything.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re trying to extract a signal from that, and the signal is what’s going to be the effect on
economic activity, on inflation, on employment, and all those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so that’s really when
we say “signal and noise.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, the second thing was—?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or, similarly for tariff inflation, nontariff inflation, ways that you’re
making the distinction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s sort of a, a special case of that—of, you know, with the
idea being—and I think—do think that the first two months of this year are a great example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got high readings for goods inflation after a string of readings that averaged close to
zero, and you have to ask—it’s coming during tariffs, but, you know, you—it’s very hard to,
actually, scientifically go back and match up those increases and say, “Yes, I can prove that
that’s from tariffs.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it kind of has to be, to some extent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Plus, noise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There can be
idiosyncratic readings in various categories, which will shortly reverse, and that, that happens,
too, and that could be a big piece of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I think we’ll know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In a couple of months,
we’ll know whether those were—you know, where that really was from.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s a—that’s
another case where I think it’s going to be very, very challenging to unpack the inflation that we
see over the course of this year and be able to say with confidence how much of that came from
Page 16 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation and how much of it—sorry, from tariffs—and how much of it didn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s what
we’ll be doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be doing that, and so will everybody else, and we’ll all be trying very hard
to, to make that assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I, I’m sure we will make a lot of progress on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we already have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it, it’s going to be a challenge.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you have a sense yet as to what, in your mind, what makes
something cross from noise to a signal—what that threshold would look like?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it would depend on what we’re talking about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean,
obviously, you’re looking for direct evidence that, that particular pieces of, of inflation are, are—
or are clearly not—caused by tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For example, something that was, you know, in the service
sector that was far away from anything that’s tariffed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You, you might think, okay, well that is—
like, frankly, housing services inflation—which, which, by the way, has been behaving well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know—which, for, for some time, was kind of our problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now it’s been—it’s slow, but
it’s definitely, you know, moving down in a—in a very good way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s more now with goods
and, to some extent, with, with nonhousing services inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KELLY O’GRADY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly O’Grady,
CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So consumer sentiment has dipped dramatically, but you say the economy and the
hard data is still solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is your message to consumers that clearly disagree and don’t feel
that strength?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Because the hard data they’re looking at is their grocery bill.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, so a couple things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The grocery bill is about, about past
inflation, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There was inflation in ’21, ’22, and ’23, and prices went up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The current
level—it’s not the change in prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s, they’re unhappy—and, and they’re not wrong to be
unhappy—that prices went up quite a bit, and they’re paying a lot for those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s—I
Page 17 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think that is the fundamental fact and has been for a long time—a couple years—why people are
unhappy with the—with the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not that the economy’s not growing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s not that
inflation’s really high.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s not that unemployment is high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s none of those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have,
you know, 4.1 percent unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve got 2 percent growth, and, you know, it’s, it’s a
pretty good economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But people are unhappy because of the price level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and I do—we
completely understand and accept that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to follow up: Why are you still projecting two rate cuts
this year if your own projections show inflation higher for longer?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does that mean you see a
slowdown in economic growth as a real threat?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think if you—yeah, I mean, remember, we came into this
with—at the December meeting, and the median was two cuts, the median was.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so you
come in, and you see, broadly speaking, weaker growth but higher inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they kind of
balance each other out, so you think—and, and unemployment is really, really only, only a one-
tenth change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s—there’s just not a big change in the forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There really isn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Modest,
you know, meaningfully higher growth and meaningfully higher inflation, which call for
different responses, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So they cancel each other out, and people just said, “Okay, I’m going
to stay here.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the second factor is, it’s so highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is just—you know, we’re sitting here
thinking—and we, we obviously are in, in touch with businesses and households all over the
country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have an extraordinary network of contacts that come in through the Reserve Banks
and put it in the Beige Book—and also through contacts at the Board.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we get all that, and
we, we do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not
yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’re watching carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would tell people that the economy seems to be—
Page 18 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seems to be healthy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that, that sentiment is, is quite negative at this time, and that
probably has to do with, you know, turmoil at the beginning of an Administration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s making,
you know, big changes in, in areas of policy, and that’s probably part of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do think the
underlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more—is more about the
price level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask, first of all, if
you could clarify.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You were talking about how tariffs were a good part of the uptick in the
inflation forecasts, and I was just wondering what that specifically refers to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that the tariffs
that have already been put in place?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that anticipating some of the tariffs that might be coming
on April 2?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then also, if you wouldn’t mind talking a little more about the balance sheet
decision and what drove that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Did that have anything to do with expectations of how the debt
ceiling—raising the debt ceiling might affect the reserve supply?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Yeah, so, in the SEP, you’ll see that there’s not further progress on
core inflation this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re kind of side flatlining, going sideways.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t ask people to
say—to write down how much of this is from tariffs and how much of it is not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But some of it is
from tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that tariffs are coming, and we know that they’re probably already—all,
all forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core PCE inflation [and] core CPI inflation this year,
without exception.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not aware of an exception.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s in there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can’t tell you how much of
that it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the balance sheet—so, yeah, we—I think—I guess the way I’d say it is, you
know, it was the flows in and out of the, the TGA that got us thinking about it, but as we, you
know, as we thought about it, we really came to the view that this was a good time to, to make
Page 19 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the move that we made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, broadly, Committee came around—came around to the view that
we, we would do the same thing we’d already done, which is, once we—I guess in June, we—
was it June?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Whenever it was, we, we lowered the pace of QT, and we’re just going to do that
again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to cut it roughly in half.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the sense of that is, if you’re cutting the pace
of QT roughly in half, then the runway is probably doubled, okay?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s going—it’s going to
be slower for longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And people really liked that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People thought, “That’s, that’s a good idea.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s like a plane.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can think of it like a plane coming in for a landing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we get
closer and we—by the way, we still think that reserves are abundant, although you begin to see
some of the—some of the things we look at begin to react a little bit, but we still think that
they’re abundant.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, now, the TGA is emptying out, so reserves are, are higher
now, so you can’t really see the underlying signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we came around to the view, and, and it
had a lot of appeal, and so we did it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It really—it has no implications at all for monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has no implications at all for the ultimate size of the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It isn’t sending a signal in
any hidden way that you can try to tease out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just not there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re basically—it’s
very consistent with our plans and our practices that we’ve published and that we’ve followed
since we began this—what is a very successful, you know, rundown of the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again,
[this is] the second time that we’ve slowed the pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve said that we would stop when
we were somewhat above the level [of reserves] we judge as ample.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, clearly, we’re not at
that level yet, but we’re going to be approaching it more slowly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a commonsense kind of a—
kind of a thing, and it had—it had pretty broad appeal, I will say.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You said in January, Chair Powell,
that inflation expectations remained well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you still say they remain well
Page 20 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
anchored today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to reiterate the question others have asked, if they’re not so well
anchored, why hasn’t there been a more radical shift to the policy path today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when we—when we talk about inflation expectations being well
anchored, we’re talking about longer-run inflation expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they really haven’t moved
much, I mean, if at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There, there’s one reading that everyone’s focusing on that’s higher, but
the other survey readings and the market-based readings all show relatively, you know, well-
anchored inflation expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You would expect that expectations of inflation over the course
of a year would move around, because conditions change, and in this case, we have tariffs
coming in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know how big, what’s—there’s so many things we don’t know, but we
kind of know there are going to be tariffs, and they tend to bring growth down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They tend to
bring inflation up at the—in the first instance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so I would say, you, you know, I’m not
dismissing what we’re seeing in short-term inflation expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, as I mentioned, follow
that very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But when we say expectations are well anchored, we’re really looking at,
you know, longer term, five year and out, and there’s really no story to tell five years and out,
either in market based or, or in surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we keep—we’ll watch it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we’re not, you
know, we’re, we’re not going to miss any evidence that longer-term or medium-term inflation
expectations are, are moving.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin with Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Treasury Secretary Bessent has
observed that a large share of job growth over the last couple of years has been in what he calls
government or government-adjacent sectors—health care, education.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you agree that there’s
some weakness in underlying private job growth, and do you see the composition of job growth
as something that has policy implications?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 21 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that has been the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We talked about that over the course
of the last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There were—there were some good number of months and times when a lot of
the job creation was, was concentrated in, you know, educational institutions, health care, state
governments, things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There were also times when private-sector job growth has been
moving, moving in a healthy frame—and they’re all—they’re all jobs, but—and remember,
we’re, you know, we’re at very low unemployment for, you know, for, for quite a time now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
I, I think it’s a good labor market, but it’s—look, it’s something that we monitor carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>From
our standpoint, employment is employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But I, you know—the, the elected government is
entitled to have—you know, we, we don’t have policies that address different kinds of
employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, but the elected government has a—has a different role, and they can—they,
they can have those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Quick QT question: Does the Committee envision at some point
tapering the MBS runoff, runoff as well?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think tapering it—I, I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s no plan to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
know, at a certain point, we’ll stop runoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we may or may not stop MBS runoff, though,
because, you know, we can—we can—we, we want to stop runoff in net at some point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
haven’t made any decisions about that, but, you know, we, we want the—we want the MBS to
roll off our balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We really, strongly desire that, so—but we haven’t made any
decisions about that, you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we will—we—I think we’d, we’d look carefully at letting
that keep going, but hold the overall size of the balance sheet in, you know, constant, at some
point—a point that we’re not at yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
SIMON RABINOVITCH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair
Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Several times today, you’ve said that you feel you’re well positioned to wait for greater
clarity.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At the same time, you could point to quite a few growth risks at the moment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve
seen a stock market that’s gone quite wobbly, rapidly cooling housing sales, plunging confidence
surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, not only did the SEP mark down the growth outlook, 17 of 19 see risks to the
downside.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So my question is, how confident are you that you’re well positioned?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or is that one
more thing that you’re uncertain about?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m confident that we’re well positioned in the sense that we’re,
we’re well positioned to move in the direction we’ll need to move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I mean, I, I don’t know
anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the point is, we are—we are at, you
know, we’re at a place where we can cut or we—or we can hold what is a clearly a restrictive
stance of policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what I mean.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I mean, I think we’re—that’s well positioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Forecasting right now, it’s—you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current
situation, I just think it’s—uncertainty is, you know, remarkably high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, sorry, standing here today, would you be surprised to, to
pivot back towards rate cuts in May?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, like, I, I think we’re not going to be in any hurry to move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as
I mentioned, I think we’re, we’re well positioned to wait for further clarity, and not in any hurry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matt Egan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The Fed’s statement
released today removed the line that previously said “the Committee judges that the risks to
achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you explain the
Page 23 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
decision to remove that line?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does it mean that you’re now more concerned about inflation or
about employment?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Actually, it does not mean either of those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
sometimes with language they—it, it lives its, its useful life, and then we take it off, and we—
and, and that was the case there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s really not meant to be any signal here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past
year, you know, conveying this sense of the balance of risks was important that they be in
balance or close to being in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was useful as we approach liftoff, if you remember.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re past that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or, I’m sorry, no—beginning, beginning to cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we just—so we just
took it out.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I actually would say that the more important thing now about risks—and this is in,
in pages like 10, 11, 12 of the SEP—if you look, participants widely raised their estimate of, of
the risks to our—of uncertainty, but also of the risks to growth in our employment and inflation
mandates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s a more salient point now than whether they’re—whether they’re in
balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just on the, the stock market, the stock market has obviously declined
significantly since the Fed last met.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you concerned at all about some of the market volatility
having a real economic impact in terms of hurting business spending or consumer spending,
especially among higher-income households?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So financial conditions matter to us because, you know, financial
conditions are the main channel to the real economy through which our policy has its effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
so they’re important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what matters from, from a Fed standpoint for the macroeconomy is
material changes to overall financial conditions that are persistent, that last for a while—long
enough to actually affect economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what we’re looking for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I’m not going
to opine on the appropriate level of any market—equity, debt, commodities, or anything like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 24 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And I would just point you to the—to the bigger picture again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the, the real
economy, the, the hard data are still in, in reasonably good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s the soft data—it’s the
surveys that are showing, you know, significant concerns, downside risks, and those kind of
things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t dismiss that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re watching it carefully, but, you know, we, we don’t want to
get ahead of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we want to focus on the hard data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This—if it’s—if that’s
going to affect the hard data, we should know it very quickly, and, and, of course, we’ll, we’ll
understand that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you don’t see that yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you look to navigate higher inflation and lower growth, the Fed has talked
about heeding the lessons from the 1970s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the Fed willing to have a recession if it means
breaking the back of inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, fortunately, we’re in a situation where we have seen inflation
move down from, you know, higher levels to pretty close to 2 percent, while the unemployment
rate has remained very consistent with full employment, 4.1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we now have inflation
coming in from an exogenous source, but the underlying inflationary picture before that was, you
know, basically 2½ percent inflation, I would say, and 2 percent growth, and 4 percent
unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so that’s what—that’s what we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what, together, the economy
accomplished.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t see any reason to think that we’re looking at, at a replay of the ’70s or
anything like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, inflation—underlying inflation is, is, you know, still running in
the 2s, with probably a little bit of a pickup associated with tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I don’t think we’re
facing—I, I wouldn’t say we’re in, in a situation that’s remotely comparable to that.</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s reports there could be a bill introduced on

growth and, and outlook for inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I—it’s not—it’s not appropriate for me to speculate on
political ideas or, or fiscal policy, for that matter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m going to—I’m going to pass on that
one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Daniel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>DANIEL AVIS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You
mentioned that tariffs are already having at least some impact on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just wondering
how you and your colleagues on the FOMC have been thinking about the possibility of
retaliatory tariffs from other countries, especially with April 2 coming up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was it something you
considered during this meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, since the very beginning, we’ve had kind of a placeholder—the
staff has a placeholder of—range of—really a range of possible outcomes from tariffs, and from
trade policy generally.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they generally assume full retaliation in those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s, that’s
kind of baked into the numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What happens—it will be complicated, and there will be some
retaliation and some not and, and all that, but, ultimately, they’re trying to, with the placeholder,
give us a broad sense of what this might look like.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This—when we know—when we actually
know the specifics, we’ll be able to, to have still uncertain but, you know, better-informed
forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so, yes, that’s in there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Last question goes to Jean.</del></p>

JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Had a couple
questions on the balance sheet change that you made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the minutes had initially described
your discussion on slowing QT as temporary, until the debt ceiling is resolved, but it—from what
you said earlier, doesn’t sound like there’s a desire to kind of regain the pace of QT that we have
at the moment after the, the debt ceiling is resolved.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that the case?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Yeah, so we, we looked at pausing, and we looked at, at slowing,
and, really, people came together very strongly behind slowing, not pausing, for a variety of
reasons.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so people really came to be, you know, pretty strongly in favor of, of this move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
slows down the path and probably lengthens it—you know, doubles it, effectively, by slowing it
by half.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s—people thought that’s, that’s a good place to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’ll, it’ll, you know,
help us assure that this path is, is a smooth one as we get closer and closer to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how
that came about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I guess my question is more, was that meant to be a temporary
measure during the debt ceiling episode, or—?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it was—it was actually—it was the, the TGA flows—
Treasury General Account flows that got us thinking about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the more we thought about
it, we came around to this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, it, it is—yes, it was provoked.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The original
discussion was provoked by that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think what we came up with, though, was broader than
that and different than it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It does address that issue, but it really is also—it fits in really nicely
with our principles and our plans, and the things we’ve done before, and the things we’ve said
we would do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s why I—you know, pretty, pretty strong support.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d just say it’s, it’s
nothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with the size of the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just
kind of a commonsense adjustment as you get closer and closer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s slow down a little bit

again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, that way, we’ll be more and more confident that we’re getting where we need to get.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can take your time getting there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re shrinking the balance sheet every
month, and we think that’s—we think it was a good play and, as I mentioned, well supported.</del></p>
