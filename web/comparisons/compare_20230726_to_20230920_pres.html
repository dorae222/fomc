Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 20, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Good afternoon, everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>My colleagues and I remain squarely
focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the
American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain
strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Looking ahead, we’re in a position
to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be
appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and
the evolving outlook and risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and,
so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Recent readings on
consumer spending have been particularly robust.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Activity in the housing sector has picked up
somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage
rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In our
Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments
Page 1 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Participants expect growth
to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate
ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has moved
up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward
pressures on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from
3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Based on the consumer
price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the
12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core
PCE prices rose 3.9 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,
and longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad
range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
has a long way to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this
year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure
on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from
tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In light of how far we have come in
tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the
federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our
securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP,
FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the
federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most
likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this
year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Compared with our June
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year
but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>These projections, of
course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the
path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability
goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the
Page 3 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well
as the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the
incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Real interest rates now are well above
mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties
in precisely gauging the stance of policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,
and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving
down sustainably toward our objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price
stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over
the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What makes the
Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive,
Page 4 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s noted uncertainty about policy lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Headwinds have emerged from the looming
government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt
payments—things of that nature.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit
differently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at
5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we say we’re
committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive
to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the fact that we decided to
maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have
not at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you looked at
the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants
believe that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates
one more time in the two remaining meetings this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Others believe that we have already
reached that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by
deciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, right now, it’s still an open question about “sufficiently
restrictive”—you’re not saying today that we’ve reached this level?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we
decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to see convincing
evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—
we’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we need to see more
progress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
COLBY SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And just on the 2024 projections—what’s behind that shallower path
for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real
interest rates are, are positive now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We
need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we need—
we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, you know—
remember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a
plan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a cumulation of individual
forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t want to,
you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But what it reflects, though, is that
economic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be
appropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our
inflation goal, as you see in the SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Rachel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding
steady?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could
you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our
current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But this,
of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’ve got—you
have some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between
Page 6 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now and the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next
two meetings that we have between the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it wasn’t like we were arguing over
that—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see
how the data come in.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
want to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last
three months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to see, you
know—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good
example of what we do—of what we do want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was a combination of, of, you know,
of—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those are
the two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that
we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be
careful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that
the data, you know, support that conclusion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and
how quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we
assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting
by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, in your view, what would—I know nothing has been
decided yet—but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to
inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out
for us?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one
way or the other won’t matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a
pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always
Page 7 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to be learning from data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ve learned all through the course of the last year
that, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you go back a year—and what we
thought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we don’t really
know until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A
year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now—now we’re fairly close, we think,
to where we need to get.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t
attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, you know, we
need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you
know, we’ve been moving toward it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at
which we’ve moved.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that was appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And now that we’re getting closer, we, we—
again, we have the ability to proceed carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Steve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby’s
question here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What is it saying about the Committee’s view of the inflation dynamic in the
economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a
point of the funds rate on it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Does it tell you that—does it tell us that the Committee believes
inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine, effectively?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I guess a related
question is, if you’re going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a
row, at what point do we start to think, “Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually
higher”?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense
of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen
Page 8 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that’s something
that’s appeared in the recent data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s more about stronger economic activity, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to
attribute one explanation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates—
we have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
terms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We only
know it by its works, really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we
use, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you
know, there are lags here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has
risen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising
their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher
than, than the longer-run rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run
rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is
higher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more
resilient than, than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Howard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’ve said
several times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation
consistently back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit—1.5 percent is just a
touch below what’s the estimate of potential.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So the fact that you’re getting so much done at so
much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how
Page 9 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction
that’s necessary to achieve this?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now
meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s,
that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and
in the jobs–worker gap.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I would
say, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to
be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so
that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate
comes down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better
balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So all of those things are happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we
don’t see a big increase in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is
just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is not guaranteed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>There, there
may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what
we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So just to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we’ve
gone from a very narrow path to a—to a soft landing to something different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you call the
soft landing now a baseline expectation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, no—I would not do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I would just say—what, what would
I say about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that
there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted
off.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Ultimately,
Page 10 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I do
think it’s—I do think it’s possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know—I also think, you know, this is why we’re in
a position to, to move carefully again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That—we, we will restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we know
that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we
have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is
an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t want to handicap
the likelihood of it, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not up to me to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Chair Powell, both you and
Vice Chair Williams have indicated that “sufficiently restrictive” will be judged on a real rather
than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year—provided further
compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the FOMC focused on
targeting a real level of policy restriction?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And can you explain what would constitute enough
evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real
policy settings sufficiently restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter
and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, I would say, you know—you know
“sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You—it’s not something you can arrive at with
confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so what are we seeing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the
pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing
Page 11 of 28

demand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand—the combination of those two things is
actually working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s principally now in
goods—also in housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think—we think that that is working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want
to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think
confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels
like it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that
level—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s a whole other set
of questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s what
we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But it looks like there was—because there was an across-the-board
drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it
seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same
real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you—than you
currently anticipate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and,
certainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the
data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and
the other events that are happening out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I
can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a
Page 12 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that
would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help
us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEANNA SMIALEK.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Following up on Nick’s question,
actually—John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of,
“Next year, as we see inflation kind of”—again, to Nick’s point—“as, as we see inflation coming
down, we’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we’re not squeezing the
economy harder and harder over time.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I wonder if that’s basically the logic that you
apply—you know, is that how you think about it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then I also wonder—in the last press
conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, “It’s a full year out—those
discussions,” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’t see a possibility of a rate cut in
the first half of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you
know—how you’re thinking about that timing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals
about, about cutting, I’m never intending to send a signal about timing; I’m just answering them
as, as the question is expressed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry—
the first question was, is that how?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question
we’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about
the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some
point, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Part of that may be that
real rates are rising because inflation is coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the
factors that we see in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 13 of 28

And you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that
might be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there’s—you know, there’s so much uncertainty around that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In, in—
when we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one will look back at this
and say, “Hey, we made a plan.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not like that at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—this is—these are estimates made
a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that’s how it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks so much, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin with Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wonder—how
do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we’ve been seeing is driven
by excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, relatedly,
if GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own
be a reason to consider more tightening?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very,
very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust
in its—in spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, your second
question was—
NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Does GDP stays “hot,” but without inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question will be, is, is the
level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get
back to 2 percent inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s going to be the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not—it’s not a question about
GDP on its own.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you
know—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
in a sustainable way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we’d be—we’d be
looking at GDP just, just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Victoria Guido with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are multiple external
factors that are playing out right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We see rising oil prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see auto workers striking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was just wondering,
for each of those things, could you talk about how you’re thinking about how that might affect
the course for the Fed and the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it—
you know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments,
higher long-term rates, oil price shock.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you
can—you can look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and
handicap all of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these
things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the
strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we, we do have to make an
assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so
uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It will depend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve
looked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s really
going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we—and then it also
depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So none of those
things are known right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very, very hard to know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you just have to leave that
uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and we’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period,
much more about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the same is true for the others.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we—I don’t know if you
Page 15 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
mentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t comment on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
hasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—energy
prices being up can affect spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It can affect the consumer over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A sustained period of
higher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We tend to
look through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But so the question is,
how long are, are higher prices sustained?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic
effects into account as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those are—those are some of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not sure if I hit them all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’re, you’re coming into this with an economy that
appears to have significant momentum.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s what we start with.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we—but we
do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CRAIG TORRES.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was a little surprised, Chair
Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This economy’s seeing
added supply in a way that could create long-term inflation stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have prime-age labor
force participation moving up where people can add skills.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Workers want to work.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have a
boom in manufacturing construction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve had a decent spate of homebuilding.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And since
inflation’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All are
which—good for the Fed’s longer-run target of low inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if we lose that in a recession,
aren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So are you taking this into
account as you pursue policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say
otherwise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The, the real point, though, is—the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price
stability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don’t restore price stability, inflation
comes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very
uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It can be a miserable period
to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and
again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think
now, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move
carefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we fully appreciate that—you know, the
benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market
and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in
unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—
MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of
what some economists are calling “the low-hanging fruit”—such as the unwinding of supply
chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions—or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that
involves most goods and services across the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way:
I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we
lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of
these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the
response.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that unwinding was going to be important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, monetary policy was going
to help.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general,
Page 17 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
better aligning supply with demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those two forces were always going to be important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
think it’s very hard to pull them apart.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They work together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I do think both of them are at
work now, and I think they’re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we—that we are
seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Mike.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In June,
you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you’ve more than
doubled your growth forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, what
would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And given all
the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or
the American people have in your forecasts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, forecasts are highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Forecasting is very difficult.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But to get to, to your question,
though—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Stronger than expected—and
that’s required higher rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate
unemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in
the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing
significantly higher unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, we’re continuing that trend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of inflation,
you, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s only three readings,
you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you look
at June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core
inflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in
nonhousing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those are the three buckets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Headline inflation, of course, has come way
Page 18 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think—people
should know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain
forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But these are—these are our forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, they’re, they’re—we have very
high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other
forecasters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Given the—given the forecast that you have, what justified not
moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming
down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate
increases that we’ve made.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly,
and we did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary
policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the
risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening
becomes more equal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach
that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that, that’s what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So
we’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more
carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need
to get inflation back down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>With your focus on year-over-year PCE, isn’t it true that base effects are huge
and that by the time you meet in November, that it’s more likely that you’ll have a low PCE
number that would make you feel more comfortable?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, secondly, how would the lack of key
Page 19 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
indicators—like CPI, the jobs report—impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to
have a government shutdown?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What was—missed what
factors?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The base factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Base factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on that, we’re, you know, we’re
looking at just monthly, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase
was from the prior month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base
factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we can—we can adjust for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we
don’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It—it’s possible—if, if there is a
government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t—
we wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we
would just have to deal with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s hard for me to say in advance how that
would affect that meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects
that—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November,
would you feel more comfortable at that point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, yes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how
much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, that’s what we’re looking
at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And month by month, what’s the reading?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I think—I think what we’re
really looking at is, there’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but
they’re incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s why we look at 12-month [rates].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 20 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But I think, in this situation—where it looks like we’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in
June—we’re also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months’ inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That—that’s the right way to
go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what
to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can let the data evolve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for the question, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I want to focus back in on oil prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re seeing oil prices, as you
mentioned, move up, and that’s pushing the price of gas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So how does that factor into your
decision to raise rates or not—because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we’ve
seen, the overall inflation has actually risen?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, energy prices are very important for the
consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This, this can affect consumer spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It, it really
comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The reason why we look
at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how
tight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>However, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high,
that’ll have an effect on spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations
of inflation—things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s just things we have to monitor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the consumer—they’re putting more and more of this on
their credit card.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How long do you
Page 21 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And are you concerned
about a, a debt bubble related to that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to
look through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Consumer distress—
measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—
during and after the, the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re now moving back up to normal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re
watching that carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic
era.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEAN YUNG.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yields along the Treasury curve
have risen to their highest in years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is the Fed’s view about what’s been driving that
increase in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations—and how
much to technical factors?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, rates have moved up significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I
think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition
of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation
expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields—
and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a
very precise answer, but they give you different answers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re
moving up because—it’s not because of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s because probably—it’ll probably have
Page 22 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
something to do with stronger growth, I would say—more, more supply of Treasuries.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kyle Campbell, American Banker.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking the
questions—just two on, on housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline
and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’s also some questions out
there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which
are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it’s measured and
felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And then as far as a constrained housing
supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now
than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about
taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over
time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so—and supply is kind of
structurally constrained.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as,
as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re-
leased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A year ago, it would have
been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So as
those leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing
services inflation coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your second question was the lock-ins.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much is that
affecting things, really?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 23 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
KYLE CAMPBELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates
down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a
lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea
being that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they
want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly
in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight—
in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I, I don’t think it would.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
mean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what,
what rates does the economy need?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic
or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point
that—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think
that that would be a reason for us not to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something we’re thinking about at all
right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair
Powell, you’ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence,
maybe cut back consumer spending—possible government shutdown, high gas prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At this
point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Would that help you get
inflation closer to your 2 percent target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I wouldn’t say it that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re not looking for a decrease in
consumer spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a good thing that the
Page 24 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we’ve done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a good thing
that the labor market’s strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The, the only concern—it, it just means this: If the economy
comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary
policy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that answer your
question?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I guess, on the other hand, would you
worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, that’s always a concern.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I mean, concern number one is, is
restoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that
we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight
labor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that said—of
course, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how
quickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of
that consideration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of
rate sensitivity than in the past.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Obviously, we’ve talked about households with long fixed-rate
mortgages—also companies that refinanced before last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is your thinking about the
efficacy of rates and how that’s changed?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, related to that, how do you think about the
distributional consequences in the sense that if you’re a relatively wealthy household with a long
fixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if
Page 25 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a
lot tougher a lot more quickly?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has
been stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why is that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One, one
is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had
understood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not sure about
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question is whether that’s
sustainable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could
also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long
enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s—there are many candidate explanations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to, in, in all this
uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a
very strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We were making progress on
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth is strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call
for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s where we are, and, you
know, we have to—we have to deal with what comes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On your second question, which was—
sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer
about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My point there was that if you’re somebody who has a
long fixed-rate mortgage, you’ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you’re
somebody who’s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are
punitive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 26 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so the point I would make there is that we’re trying to get
inflation back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a
fixed income.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you’re a person who spends all of your income, you don’t really have any
meaningful savings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You spend all your income on the basics of life—clothing, food,
transportation, heating—the basics—and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you’re in trouble right
away, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and,
and we, we want to do it as quickly as possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Obviously, we—we’d like to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’d like
the current trend to continue, which is that we’re making progress without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that we’ve seen past—in past things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you’re right, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When
we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to
feel that more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a—have a
much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to—it’s not going to affect
them as much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GREG ROBB.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the Beige
Book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups
about the economic health of low-income Americans—moderate-income Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I have two
questions about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a
quarterly survey of those groups—like the senior loan officer survey?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And from your—and also
the second question is, from your recent look—readings of these surveys, how are low and
moderate Americans doing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy
Page 27 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Americans kind of driving things?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s an idea we
can—we can take away and think about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you
know, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think during the pandemic,
the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, if you know
the—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were
actually in very, very strong financial condition.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and
you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of]
real wages are now positive by most—by most measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think, overall, households are
in good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Surveys are a different thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of
that is just, people hate inflation—hate it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s
terrible.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, at the same time, they’re spending money.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Their behavior is, is not exactly what
you would expect from the surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
I, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in
the labor market and with wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low-
wage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages,
which is a good thing.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 26, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Good afternoon.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Price stability is the responsibility of the
Federal Reserve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In particular,
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions
that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and
we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve covered a lot of
ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Looking ahead, we will
continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Although activity
in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear
to be weighing on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market remains very tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, job gains averaged
244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The
unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are some continuing signs that supply and
Page 1 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has
moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>While the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of
available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the 12 months
ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In June, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, the process
of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Despite elevated inflation,
longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our
mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are also continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With today’s action, we’ve raised our
Page 2 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have been seeing the effects of our
policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy,
particularly housing and investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It will take time, however, for the full effects of our
ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, the economy is
facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely
to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
and economic and financial developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</del></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, thank you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You have, I think a couple of times in
your opening remarks, talked about this language “in determining the extent of additional policy
firming that may be appropriate.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on
the way?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And should we also believe that all future meetings—say, September and November—
are live, or are you in an every-other-meeting mode?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not
something we’ve looked at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into
each meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we haven’t made any
decisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you
read the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations:
Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the
June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the June CPI
report, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We hope that
inflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we
don’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, what are we going to be looking at?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader
picture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re looking for supply
and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the
labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ll be looking at inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole
collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if we
make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how we’re thinking about
Page 4 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the next meeting and, you know, how we’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially,
but, you know, we’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we
get two more job reports, two more CPI reports.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think we have an ECI report coming later this
week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say it
is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant
it, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re
going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying
we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Monetary policy,
we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there: You
said the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that
mean there’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that
two more hikes are necessary?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just going to go back to what I said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we—you know, that’s
the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I
recited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it really—we
did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s just one reading, as
everybody knows.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Many
forecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we
see the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll be focusing on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEANNA SMIALEK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ve
seen the Barbie movie numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this
summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does seem like
growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I wonder, from your
perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know,
performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’s inflationary, or is it good news
because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just how are you thinking about that sort
of trajectory?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the
economy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any
meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a
good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s good to see that, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence
coming up and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That will support activity going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you’re, you’re
right, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that
would require an appropriate response for monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll be watching that carefully
and seeing how it evolves over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MICHELE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, as you referenced
earlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look
good.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if you’re data dependent, why not pause again?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why not stay on hold?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why not take
another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if you go back to what we’re trying to do here, we’re trying to
achieve a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At
the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that would take—of what that would
take, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say, we looked at
the interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent,
but broadly consistent with expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as a result, we went ahead and, and took another
step.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but, but gradually
slowing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but, you
know, we’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from, from a single reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how we look at it, and, and so
we did take that step today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, markets
widely believe the median FOMC participant’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter
of this year will be too high, given autos and shelter, and that by September, that may warrant a
downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Would that type of inflation
progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below-trend growth and
decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you’ve done enough?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of
this and how much of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ll be looking at everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’ll, of
course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the
opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be looking at the growth
data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall
Page 7 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on, on
making progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If I could follow up: Last month you said there were benefits to
moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that
slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
September, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots
of activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision
then.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that
we decide to maintain at that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves
is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if we
get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee—
then we will move ahead.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining
policy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just
don’t have it yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So consumer
confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of, of the declines in headline
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long
time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of
3 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side
of the dual mandate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I’d say it this way: First, it is—it is a good thing that
headline inflation has come down so much, because that’s really what the public experiences.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a—it
will strengthen the broad sense that, that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will
in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you are really—sorry, your question
was?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I mean, you’ve talked for many press conferences
now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So how much of that are we
still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I would put it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s
really a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too
little?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there
really are risks on both sides.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not,
but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do
increasingly face that risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down
that far, you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better
signal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by
volatile energy and food prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because
that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And
core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s reason to think it can come down now,
but it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re
Page 9 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we need to
be prepared to raise further if that—if we think that’s appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, and then if inflation were to—just a quick
follow[up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in
unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People are talking
about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but how much?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment
rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So that’s a real
blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s not
that we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have
to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and
slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that is still the, the likely outcome here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we hope that that’s
as little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not
get it done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-
term social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is
volatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the—
that’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 10 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHAEL MCKEE.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we
have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to
the downside.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now
under these conditions?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do you think you might need to do more, because I’m curious about
what you see as inflation dynamics now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the economy still moving in a direction where it
creates more inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have
some large labor settlements.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or is the economy disinflating, and you’re just, you’re able to go
back to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is,
we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to
demand and supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to
help ease inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand
balance, particularly in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And all of that should lead to declining inflationary
pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re
seeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are
telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have
its full desired effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that
inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further
tighten if that is appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long
way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, do you think under current conditions you are restrictive
enough unless something changes?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 11 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I think—we think, you know, today’s rate hike was
appropriate, and I think we’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at
the next meeting about, is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if it does
tell us that—collectively, if that’s our view—then we will do more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If September is,
in fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace
that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the
June meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every
other meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could be two out of three meetings, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could be—it just means if you’re
slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and
closer to, we think, our destination.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every
other meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment
where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes
all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so
that’s what we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I, I think it’s possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mentioned it before.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s possible that we
would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
really going to depend on what the data tell us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the best we can do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we shouldn’t assume that every other meeting is the lowest
tightening frequency, let’s say?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could be, you know, longer intervals in between as well?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 12 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’re—look, I think we’re going to—we’re going to make a
decision about the next meeting, and then we’re going to make a decision about the one after
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think it’ll sort itself out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, among your
colleagues, there have been people who’ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken
place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it’s
happened very fast this time, and it’s kind of up to date.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Where are you on that continuum?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in
financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation,
right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our
decisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier
than it—than it used to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that
it has.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know
that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and
variable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of
the lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>First, the first thing to say is, we’re
determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one should doubt that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would look at it this way, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The real federal funds rate is now
in meaningfully positive territory.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the
mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is
Page 13 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well above most estimates of the longer-term neutral rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say, monetary policy is
restrictive, more so after today’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on
economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not
appropriate to do so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how I think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are resolutely
committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has proved,
repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at
some point, that may change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve
come, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the—on the credit side, I’m wondering if you saw
anything in the—in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’re getting a quantum of
credit contraction beyond what you’d expect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The bank lending data really is—the growth rate’s
edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession
indicator.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I
would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got
lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it,
it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s really hard to tease
out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the
overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS
will say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 14 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what
share of that credit you would give to factors that don’t stem directly from rate hikes or that
might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the
past year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, interesting question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me start by saying that the
inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and,
and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic
and the response from fiscal and monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve always expected that the
disinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-
related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which
would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think
that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down
sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a]
reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s a
good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both
factors, both that I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing
an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into
services and away from goods.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And take autos as an example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The combination of an increase in sales and inventories,
while, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s
Page 15 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also a role for demand, as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
they’re both working there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Housing services inflation now starts to move down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Clearly, higher
rates have, have slowed the housing market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I would say, monetary policy is
working about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward,
in particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market
will come in as a very, very important factor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we think both of those—both of those sources
of disinflation are playing an important role.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources,
that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there a more even split
there, too?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward
because we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very
specific pandemic things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and
shortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be
important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First, let me compliment your tie,
the choice of tie.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a good color.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So thanks for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the Beige Book, it
said, “Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably” for
manufacturing sectors.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Is that an indication that there’s a, a wage inflation pressure?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And how
do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that
supply chains and, and shortages are easing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, what was the first part of it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, wage inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Like, how do you—how do you target
wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think what
we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what
we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So wages have actually been gradually moving down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re still at levels what
would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, we’re making progress there.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And by so many indicators, labor market demand is
cooling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can
look at the quits rate normalizing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can look at job openings coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can look at
just job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it
was at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s actually not a bad thing, in
a sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is
really the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work,
getting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s
gradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want
to get.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But still we see a push to raise minimum wage.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re seeing
a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is, they come out with
agreements like big pay increases, like UPS, and we have the autoworkers coming up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you
concerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contracts, pushing wage inflation
then?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 17 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not for us to comment on, on contract negotiations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not our job, not
our role.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we monitor these things, and we’ll keep an eye on them, but, really,
that’s something that’s, that’s handled at that level and not—
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Victoria Guida with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wanted to ask about the SEP,
which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under
3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so I’m wondering, is the level of inflation what’s sort of important there as you
think about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which
inflation is falling also important?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think you’d take both into account.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think you’d take everything
into account when you start cutting rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide
range of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just
is a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s
time to start cutting rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what
happens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there, what’s motivating people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if it’s sort of—sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you
wouldn’t necessarily cut rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not giving you any
numerical guidance around that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when
we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would be—you
know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the median was several for next
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,
Page 18 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and it’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is, in fact, coming down to our 2 percent
goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>STEVE MATTHEWS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the
Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing, and they’ve reduced their forecast for a
recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession
being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident
that you can achieve a soft landing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and
my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without
the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in
some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
been my view.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s still my view.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent
with, with what I see today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have
a lot left to go to see that happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the
forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a
recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is
independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Having an independent
staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our
process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make—
informs our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 19 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE MATTHEWS.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and
you still have a strong labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, does that add to the optimism?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would—I would
say, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve,
we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s, that’s a really good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s
very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And consistent with having a soft
landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still
likely as we—as we go forward with this process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t—
we haven’t really seen that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher
unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the
way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen
participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the
temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it
continues.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEFF COX.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You and other Fed
officials in the past have suggested that you don’t need to keep hiking until inflation hits
2 percent, that—as long as you see continued progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I’m wondering, how close do you
need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How many months of data do you need to
Page 20 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see that will—that will give you sufficient confidence, and how, how far does this fight need to
go before you’re willing to kind of declare victory on it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to
2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s
clearly not the appropriate way to think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we,
we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a
grain of salt.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal
funds rate is at a restrictive level now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a
restrictive level anymore.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and
then below a neutral level at a certain point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we would, you know, we would—we, of
course, would be very careful about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming
down in a sustainable level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical
assessment of when and where that would be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d
start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before
you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation
until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s been over four months since a handful of regional banks, including Silicon
Valley Bank, failed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When you look at credit conditions now, given Banc of California’s
acquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt, or are you
Page 21 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
comfortable saying that we’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this
point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And how does this play into your outlook for policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I
will say, things have settled down for sure out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Deposit flows have stabilized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Capital and
liquidity remain strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up
significantly year over year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we’re still watching,
you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the
banking sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were,
were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more
affected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort
of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They may be
tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are
tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think—I think
we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think—I think, basically,
we’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s,
that’s going to restrain economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is restraining economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how I
would look at it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And how is that informing your outlook for setting
policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we—that goes—that’s—an expected result of tightening
interest rate policy is that—is that bank credit conditions—bank lending conditions would
tighten as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened
in May?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just don’t think we know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’re looking at the current data in GDP, and
we’re seeing strong spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re seeing a strong economy, and it’s made us confident that
we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I—it
seems like the economy is weathering this well, but, of course, we’re watching it carefully and,
and expect to continue to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Megan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MEGAN CASSELLA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary
impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer
sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we’ve been seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that
increases in] real wages are positive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, that’s a great thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we want that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
want people to have [gains in] real wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s
consistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages
have been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We expect to see more of
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We don’t really think
that, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I
would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor market conditions
broadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we
think we need some further softening in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 23 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MEGAN CASSELLA.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you
mentioned at the start how you’re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might
be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families
if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment
back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s the message there of, of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise
them?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get
inflation under control.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit
those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get
inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think that is the most
important thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away
are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or,
you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re
just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right
away.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People, people
on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we need—we need to
get this done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we
don’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s how I would explain what
we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
Page 24 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the event, the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate
move that you announced today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The decision was, of course, unanimous, and the statement was
basically unchanged from last month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting
actually a live one?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision
was, was actually going to be?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I mean, you could—“Was there doubt?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look, I would say
there’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks, you’ll
see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should
do at the next meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many times when we go
into a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, we have the
meeting, and some—some—some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others, and I’ll
just leave it at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Evan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>EVAN RYSER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Evan Ryser, Market News International.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks—the dollar, the
stock market, et cetera.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come
down to target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course,
very focused on rates and our own policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy
tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication
is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could
mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what tends to happen,
Page 25 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though, is, financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we’re doing, and, and,
ultimately, over time, we get where we need to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If I could also ask about the SEP from June that showed rate cuts—do
you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So that, that could happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question is, you know, is that
consistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world
where things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more
normal levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to
continue it, depending on where you are in the cycle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So they are two independent things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you can imagine circumstances
in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different
ways.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that wouldn’t be the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Kyle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kyle Campbell with American Banker.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
have a question about the discount window.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering if, since the bank failures of the
spring, if you’ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that
they’re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether
policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to, to show that
they are prepared to use it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s a very important thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And yes to both sides of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window,
and we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We did find, as you know,
during the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It can be a little

clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So why not be in a situation where, where
you’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Mark Hamrick.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MARK HAMRICK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve talked in the
past about getting the housing market back into better balance—excuse me—and also that the
market might have bottomed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right
now, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might
otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and,
of course, also all of that happening with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage still around 7 percent
on the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’re talking about tightening industry lending
standards?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are we getting closer to balance or farther away?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s your sense?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the
reasons that you talked about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have
low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going
to because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing
homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>On the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and,
and there are people coming in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming
in, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think this will take some time to work through.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Hopefully, more supply comes on line,
and, you know, we, we work through it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath
of the—of the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</del></p>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage
through the Black Sea, and alternative routes at this point could be closed off.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Just wondering,
how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, and how closely are you
watching that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are watching it, of course, very closely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security,
particularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Grain prices did go up on
this news, but they remain well below their peaks of last spring.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And the moves that we’ve seen
so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of
course, we will be watching that situation carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you don’t think it would have a big effect on Fed
policy at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Doesn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You wouldn’t say so looking at what we—what we
know now.</del></p>
