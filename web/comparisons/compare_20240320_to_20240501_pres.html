Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 1, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Inflation has
eased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s
very good news.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not
assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are fully committed to returning inflation to our
2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market
that benefits all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our restrictive stance of monetary
policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our
2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters, even as high interest rates

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have weighed on housing and equipment investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Improving supply conditions have
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come
into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while
the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Strong job creation over the past year has
been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation
among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal
wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor
demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The inflation data
received so far this year have been higher than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Although some measures of short-term
inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear
to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
Page 2 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
holdings, though at a slower pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and
inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved
toward better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly
attentive to inflation risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range
for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is
likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are
prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we’ve seen on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too
little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering any adjustments
to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,
the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks
and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to
make decisions meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Turning to our balance sheet: The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the
pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per
month to $25 billion per month as of June 1.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold
primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities
Page 3 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unchanged per month, and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury
securities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion
per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The decision to
slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it
would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to
set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>A question and
follow-up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still—are you confident that it’s
sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I do think the evidence shows, you know, pretty clearly that
policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can start with the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So demand is still strong—the demand side of the
labor market, in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,
Page 4 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and you see that in job openings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You saw it—more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report,
as you’ll know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s still higher than pre-pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it has been coming down both in the
Indeed report and the JOLTS report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s, that’s demand cooling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The same is true of quits
and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I also look at the—we look at surveys of
workers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses, and [they] ask workers, “Are jobs
plentiful?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>and ask businesses, “Are workers plentiful?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it easy to find workers?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’ve
seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You also see in
interest-sensitive spending, like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates
are weighing on those activities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sufficiently restrictive, I guess.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that]
over time it will be sufficiently restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That will be a question that, that the data will have to
answer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So as a follow-up, if inflation continues running roughly
sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and
expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Expectations are not anchored?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Stable, roughly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you disrupt that for the last half point
on PCE?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I don’t want to get into complicated hypotheticals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I
would say that, you know, we’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy
for as long as is appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wonder—you
know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to
increase further, although it’s not her baseline outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder if you see that as a risk as well,
and, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d say it’s unlikely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is—
which is how long to keep policy restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You ask, what would it take?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, I think
we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re
seeing, as I—as I mentioned, but that’s—something like that is what it would take.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’d look at
the totality of the data in answer to that question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That would include inflation, inflation
expectations, and all the other data too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Would that be—would that be a reacceleration in inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come
to that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of
all the things we’d be looking at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It could be expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could be a combination of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that
conclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.</strong></em></p>

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
didn’t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn’t mention the idea that it
might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
has the Fed sort of dropped its easing bias?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where are you standing on that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, on—let me address cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, obviously, our decisions that we
make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving,
and the balance of risks, as always.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll look at the totality of the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, and we
think, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And
we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance
until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves
more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving
sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could
be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there’s also other paths that the economy could take, which, which would cause us
to want to consider rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain
greater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and
another path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it really will depend on the
data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think the data
will have to answer that question for us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And could you just follow—on the path where you might
not cut, is that—you mentioned that would be inflation persistent—I mean, is inflation—would
that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin
to reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know,
moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the
performance of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’d also be looking at inflation expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’d be looking at the
whole story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that
decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, to what
extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in
growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed
to resume the sort of disinflation the economy saw last year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s hard to know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ll be able to look back,
you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, if you look
at—let’s look at growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Really, what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth
coming in about consistent with where it was last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I know GDP came in lower, but you
don’t see an acceleration in growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the thought would be that financial conditions
loosened in, in, December, and that caused an uptick in activity, and that caused inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Presumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You don’t really see that
happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as, as last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So, you know, what’s causing this inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ll, we’ll have a better sense of that
over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know that there’s an obvious connection there, though, with easing of
financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rates are certainly higher now
and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they’re higher,
and that’s tighter financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation
has done in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’t necessarily
preclude rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wonder, would continued strength in the labor market change your view
about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was
reaccelerating?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the
labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And remember what we saw last year: very strong growth, a really tight labor
market, and a historically fast decline in inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and that’s because we know there are
two forces at work here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions
and demand-side distortions, and there’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary
policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I wouldn’t give
up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because, you know, we do
see that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also,
even when the supply-side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic
activity and ultimately inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there are still those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t like to say that either
strong—either growth or, or a strong labor market, in and of itself, would automatically create
problems on inflation, because, of course, it didn’t do that last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 9 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You ask about wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also don’t—we don’t target wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We target price inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is one of the inputs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The point with wages is, of course, we, like everyone else, like to see high
wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s really what we’re
trying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to
bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Part of that will probably be having
wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is
sustainably moving back down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s May now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you have time this year to cut
three times, just given the calendar?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not really thinking of it that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the—what
we said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said
that we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’ve said that it appears, then,
that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t know how long
it’ll take.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in
scope.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I don’t know exactly when that will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on
now, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more
worrying than just expected bumpiness?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—you know, not really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, what, what—so I thought it was
appropriate to reserve judgment until, until we had the full quarter’s data, until we saw the March
data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so take a step back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What do we now see in the first quarter?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see strong economic
Page 10 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We see three inflation readings, and
so I think you’re at a point there where you should take some signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t like to react to
one or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now,
and we are taking signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us
to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the
signal that we’re taking now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chair, if I could—Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up
on that: What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first
quarter?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and
quarters?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we will—you know, we will put the thing—we have put
the thing under a microscope.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will say, nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to
change the view.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that, in fact, we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer
to get that confidence—but—confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just think—you know the story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s happened
since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher
nonhousing services inflation than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And those two are working together to, to sort of be
higher than we had thought.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know,
we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation
move back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s my forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think my confidence in that is lower than it was
because of the data that we’ve seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we’re looking at those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also
continue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market
rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We believe that it
Page 11 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just—it looks like the lag—that there are substantial lags between when, you know,
lower market rates turned up and—for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or
for in-housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could just follow up: Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea
that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you’re holding
rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the active tool of monetary policy
is, of course, the interest rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to
slow, really not in order to, you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be
less restrictive to the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance
sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial
market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve
ever done this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CRAIG TORRES.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Two questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First, a simple one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased
or stayed the same?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the first question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Second question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, you joined the
Board in 2012, and I’m sure you remember, as I do, what the jobless recovery was like: lawyers,
accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’t get jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And given your history
there, I wonder if there’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We have strong
productivity growth that’s helping wages grow up—go up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We have good employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
it seems to me there’s a lot of hysteria about inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I agree—you know, nobody likes it, but is
Page 12 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
there an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over
time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut
until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
didn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, in fact, what really
happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think
there are—you know, I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to
predict—to predict its path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s really going to depend on the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our,
our sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of
them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It actually—it’s the
time to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that was
clearly inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So our focus was very much on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As—and this is what we referred to
in the statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month
basis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The employment goal now comes
back into focus.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we are focusing on it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and that’s how we think about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask
the questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that
you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that’s going to allow you to have a situation where
rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’d be good if you could just
Page 13 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
confirm whether or not that’s a correct reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the Q1 GDP print has led to some—some to
start mentioning the term “stagflation” with respect to the U.S. economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you or anyone else
on the FOMC think this is now a risk?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not dealing really in likelihoods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there are—there
are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal
forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know that it
will be enough, sufficient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know that it won’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’re going to have to let the data
lead us on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess I would say I
was around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was
high single-digits inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have
3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we
have inflation running under 3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s
coming from.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that
last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know—
and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that would be—that would
be our forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That wouldn’t be stagflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That would still be to a very healthy level of
growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, with inflation, you know, our—we will return inflation to 2 percent, and
that won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Vice
Chair of the FOMC said recently that he’s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has
Page 14 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
moved up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, he’s “Mr. Potential Growth/r*.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you share that view, and would
that imply that maybe policy isn’t tight enough?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of
very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity
growth in 2022.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s hard to draw from the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the question is, will
productivity run—there are two questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One is: Will productivity run persistently above its
longer-run trend?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think we know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of potential output, though, that’s a
separate question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve had a—what amounts to a, a significant increase in the potential output
of the economy that’s not about productivity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was about having more labor, frankly, both
through—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re very
much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for
potential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think—in that
case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ve also got—so
you’ve got more supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So you’ve also got demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you
get demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary
over, over a longer period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You said earlier that, at this point, you’re not really considering
rate increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If growth is higher, but you’re not considering rate increases, does that imply that
you’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation
taking off again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is
appropriate to the current situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence
Page 15 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for that, I went over earlier.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see it in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see it in inflation-sensitive
spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s
more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the
supply side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how I would think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So GDP growth is about 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation—[Un]employment is about 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It
feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if the data remains the same
that you’re seeing, and I know you said you don’t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you
would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So was there any discussion about a
rate hike in today’s meeting, and, you know, are you satisfied with 3 percent inflation for the rest
of the year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation. “</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Three
percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Laughter] So we will return inflation to
2 percent over time but over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably
down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
don’t see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t see evidence for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s where we are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do
about, about holding the current—the current level of restriction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s really—that’s part of the
policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to follow [up] on the 3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there a time frame
of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There isn’t any rule.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can’t look to a rule.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, these are—
these are going to be judgment calls.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more
time to do its job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that is pretty clear, based on what we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How long that will take
and how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook
evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Victoria Guida with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve talked about your
commitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was just wondering, given that it’s an
election year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, similarly, is there a
significant economic difference between, you know, starting to cut in, say, September versus
December?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for
the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it’s the right thing to do for the
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s our record.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not looking at anything else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
it’s hard enough to get the economics right here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These are difficult things, and if, if we were to
take on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood
we’d actually get the economics right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how we think about it around here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, we’re at peace over it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we
think it’s the right thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll all do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s how everybody around here
thinks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I can’t say it enough, that we just don’t—we just don’t go down that road.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you go
down that road, where do you stop?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and so we’re not on that road.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re on the road

where we’re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and
how those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, is there a significant difference between, you know,
whether you start in, say, September versus December?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s—
VICTORIA GUIDA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>An economic difference.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHAIR POWELL. —</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>a significant difference between an institution that takes into
account all sorts of political events and one that doesn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s where the significant difference
is, and, you know, we’re—we just don’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, you can go back and read the
transcripts for every—this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Read all the
transcripts, and see if anybody mentions, in any way, the pending election.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just isn’t part of
our thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not what we’re hired to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we start down that road, again, I don’t know
how you stop.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Question about the labor market—
you’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Certainly, today’s JOLTS
data suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre-pandemic levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>One thing that hasn’t
normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder
if you can share your analysis of, of why that’s happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it a lagging indicator, or is
something else going on?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I think if you go back to where wages peaked—wage increases
peaked a couple, three years ago—essentially all wage measures have come down substantially
[when compared] to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But they are not, not down to where they were before the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 18 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
They’re still roughly a percentage point higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve seen pretty consistent progress but
not uniformly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was—it was expected to be—to
have come down, and, essentially, it was flat year over year, you know, I think roughly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So yeah,
I mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, again, we don’t target wage increases, but, you know,
in the longer run, if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity
would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Employers will raise prices
over time if that’s the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ve seen progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It has been inconsistent, but we have seen a
substantial decline overall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we have a ways to go on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Scott.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hey, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer from
Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You mentioned consumers, and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates
right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mortgage rates are up, as are rates for car loans, credit cards.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People looking to
borrow are very discouraged.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s reflected in their views on the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What would you
say to them?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the
lower-income brackets, is inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck, and
suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price, you, you are in
trouble right away.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’re doing is, we’re
using our tools to bring down inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It will take some time, but we will succeed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we will
bring inflation back down to 2 percent, and then people won’t have to worry about it again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the dividends will
be paid and will be very large.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and everyone will share in those dividends, and we’ve made
quite a lot of progress if you can think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think core—I think headline—core PCE
Page 19 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
[inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now it’s at—anyway, headline peaked at 7.1.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now it’s at 2.7.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Don’t want to get that wrong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, you don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Quick follow-up—are current interest
rates really doing that much, though, to fight inflation right now for those consumers?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is
doing what it’s supposed to do, and it’s—but it’s also, in this case unusually, working alongside
and with the healing of the supply side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This, this—what was different this time was that a big
part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we
had this supply-side kind of collapse, with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other
things that, that really raised demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, many factors did that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think now you see those
two things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the
pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those two things are
working to bring down inflation, and we’ve made a lot of progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s remember how far
we’ve come.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we have a ways to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve got work left to do, but we’re not looking at the
very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Courtenay.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>COURTENAY BROWN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s kind of been this long-awaited disinflation in shelter that still hasn’t arrived.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private-
sector data we’re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be
helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 20 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, essentially, there are—there are a number of places in the
economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process, and housing is one of
them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when you have—when, when someone goes to—a new person goes to rent an
apartment, that’s called market rent, and you can see market rents are barely going up at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
inflation in those has been very low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it takes—before that, they were incredibly high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They
sort of led the, the high part.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what happens is, those market rents take years, actually, to get
all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Landlords don’t tend to
charge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant, for whatever reason.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what that does is it
builds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
what happens is, you know—it’s complicated, but the story is it just takes some time for that to
get in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in
measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How—what will be the exact
timing of it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ve learned that the lags are longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We now think significantly longer
than we thought at the beginning, and so confident that it will come but not so confident in the
timing of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But, yes, I expect that, that this will happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Jasinski.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is
Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s Magazine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It seems that over the past three or four years,
economies and central banks in developed markets, at least, have been on more or less the same
trajectory: easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the
U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So my question is, what, what
Page 21 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
considerations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central
bank policies present for the FOMC?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that—you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that, that may happen, and, you know
that we all serve domestic mandates, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think the difference between the United States
and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of
growth we’re having.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little
better, but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we actually have
the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job
creation, and all of that, and we can be patient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as
we approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
priced in now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think, you know,
we haven’t seen—in addition, for the emerging market economies, we haven’t seen the kind of
turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, I think, partly because
emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much
more credibility on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to
encounter pain for inflation to come back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, given the sticky inflation data in the first
quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy, or is some
softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 22 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we thought, and most people thought, there
would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor
market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of
this episode.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That didn’t happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a tremendous result.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re very, of course, gratified
and pleased that that hasn’t happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it
really was that this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren’t
to do with monetary policy but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know,
supply problems—supply-side problems and also some, some demand issues as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, as I’ve said, I’m not giving up on
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think—I think it is possible that, that those forces will still work to help us bring
inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can’t—we can’t be guaranteed that that’s true, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And so we’re—you
know, we’re trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy
strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We will bring inflation
down to 2 percent sustainably.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We hope we can do it without, you know, without significant
dislocations in the labor market or elsewhere.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And speaking of dislocations in the labor market: In
terms of cutting, you said, if there were weakness in the job market, that could be a reason to cut
rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to
your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Would the unemployment rate popping back
above 4 percent catch your attention?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I
characterized it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to
Page 23 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>A
couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be—would probably not do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But a
broader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be
appropriate to consider cutting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and
circumstances, not just that one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KYLE CAMPBELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kyle Campbell with
American Banker.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III
Endgame proposal, and you’ve mentioned that a re-proposal is something that’s on the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As
you’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the
options available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re-proposal will be necessary,
and do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on
that front—either a re-proposal or a move to finalize?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me—let me start by saying that the Fed is committed to, you
know, completing this process and carrying out Basel III Endgame in a way that’s faithful to
Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
haven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nothing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No decisions
have been made.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll say again, though, if we conclude that re-proposal is appropriate, we won’t
hesitate to insist on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then do you need to resolve issues with the capital proposal in
order to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda, or do you expect to continue to make
progress on those other agenda items?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 24 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, there’s no mechanical rule in place there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would say
that the, you know, the Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is, I think,
occupying us at this time in terms of what’s, what’s—what we’re moving ahead with.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, what
can you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in the sense of trying to achieve
consensus, which you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or
even dissent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more
spirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you avoid groupthink and
avoid a higher risk of a policy mistake?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues
on the FOMC, you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
really don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have
12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people
who work here at the Board.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are different people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, and so each, each Reserve
Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I try to incorporate
their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I
think many people, if they feel that’s happening, you know, that for most people most of the
Page 25 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
time, that’ll be enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but I’m not—I mean, it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or
illegal or against the rules or anything like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just is the way things come out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly, more
diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and
demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D. economists.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have
people from business and law and academia and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we actually do have
quite a good diverse perspective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity,
and we look around the room and say, “I don’t understand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I really don’t understand what
they’re talking about.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but I get the question, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you very much.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 20, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Inflation has
eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path
forward is uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting
downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As labor market tightness has eased and
progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals
are moving into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high
mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In
our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to
slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over
the next two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December,
reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to
come into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs
per month.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Strong job
creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in
participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Although the jobs-to-
workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>FOMC
participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this
year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile
food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The
median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent
next year, and 2 percent in 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 2 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks
to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We believe that
our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves
broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some
point this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to
inflation risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for
longer, if appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation
back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering any adjustments to the target range
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce
the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down
toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an
unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will
continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this
Page 3 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026, still above the medium—
median longer-term funds rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion
since the Committee began reducing our portfolio.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At this meeting, we discussed issues related
to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>While we did not make any decisions
today on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of
runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The decision to slow the pace
of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would
otherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is
essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long
term.</del></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, the projections show
somewhat higher core inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>They also show somewhat stronger growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What should we
infer from this notion that, on average, rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher
and growth is higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness
to slow the economy to achieve that target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, it doesn’t—no, it doesn’t mean that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What it means is that, you
know, we’ve seen incoming—as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our
growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing, performing
well.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused
people to write up their inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on
bringing inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>When you—just to follow up: When you say that you’re willing to
either maintain the rate for longer, is—what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation
coming in above its 2 percent target?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Markets believe we will
achieve that goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen
over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we stress “over time.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do
show that happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is
Page 5 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming, but it still hasn’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that challenge
your assumption about when the shift will finally break through, since it hasn’t at that point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower
market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation
over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real
confidence that they will show up eventually over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, again, uncertainty about the exact
timing of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if
housing doesn’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this
year?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
will.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into
a new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this
year, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are
suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some
combination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before
the pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Chair Powell, during your
congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest
rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest
rates are well above neutral.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first
cut is highly consequential.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you reconcile these views for me?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If rates are well above
Page 6 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that because you anticipate one cut
would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019,
which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our—
in my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We—we’re in a situation where,
you know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if
we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to be careful.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation
coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
really what I was thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>How much of that inflation that we’ve seen so far this year do you
chalk up to one-off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some
change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about
dismissing data that we don’t like.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—
so I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers
were quite high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But,
nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The February number was high,
higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which
is not terribly high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s not like the January number.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I take the two of them together, and
I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down
gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think that story has changed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
Page 7 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also don’t think that those readings added to anyone’s confidence that we’re moving closer to, to
that point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we didn’t—the last thing I’ll say is we didn’t excessively celebrate
the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t take too much
signal out of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you
know—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to
these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>ANN SAPHIR.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, yes, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you speak a little bit more about the
timing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there enough data between now and, say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence
that you say you still need?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or, by June, is there enough data for you?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just give us a sense of
your thinking there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we make decisions meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we didn’t
make any decisions about future meetings today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those are going to depend on our ongoing
assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I really don’t
have anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean just a question of—I mean, is there even enough data for you to
be able to—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting
period, if you look back—unexpected things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss
anything.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I also mentioned—and
we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data,
particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of
Page 8 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
reducing rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, I don’t—there’s nothing in the data pointing at that, but those are the
things that we’ll be looking at, at coming meetings and—without trying to refer to any specific
meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
the projections, there is an increase in the neutral rate, as you know, and higher rates—¼ point
higher rates projected in 2025, 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you speak about why, [what] might be behind that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is
there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will
be needed in the future?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and
’26.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I
don’t think we know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the
pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important,
slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that
don’t move quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I don’t think we know.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not
go back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long-
run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t see rates going back
down to that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRIS RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the projections, you also
have 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s already at—or you mentioned it
being 2.8 in February.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, that doesn’t sound like much disinflation at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So are you really,
are you still confident or—at the last press conference, you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you
Page 9 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would get more confidence at the end of this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is it right to say that this suggests you’re not
seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we’ve seen 2023 and so forth?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen
so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that—sorry, say your
last part of your question again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you still optimistic that you’ll get the confidence you need this
year?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is
still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate
cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The other thing is, in the
second half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make
progress as you move that 12-month window forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that
confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence
that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to
potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in
the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And just in general, if labor supply
continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly
stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of
demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re
spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last
Page 10 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In fact, they
were decreasing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So you can have that if you have a continued supply-side activity that we had
last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to
hold off on rate cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, not all by itself.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, we saw—you saw last year very
strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We now have a better sense that a big part of
that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, in and of
itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin with Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you assess the state of
financial conditions right now, and particularly—in particular, do you view the kind of easing in
financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you’re trying to
achieve on the inflation mandate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we think—there are many different financial conditions
indicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But,
ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think
you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling
off a little bit from the extremely high levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there I would point to job openings, quits,
surveys, the hiring rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Things like that are really demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are also supply-side things
happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we saw—that’s been
a question for a while.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite
financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 11 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Can you
give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What
we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there
more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And also
housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go
down, and they don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve
raised your inflation forecast?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking
the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think
many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, again, you don’t
want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the question is, what are we going to
see?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger
inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to—
we’re going to let the data show.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the
road or something more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll have to find out.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In the meantime, the economy is strong, the
labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach
this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at
2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 12 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHAEL MCKEE.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that
inflation is continually moving down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Have the recent numbers we’ve gotten for inflation data
dented that confidence at all?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised
anyone’s confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of
inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that’s what you still see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve
had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a
bumpy ride.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We consistently said that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they
more than bumps?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we just don’t—we can’t know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s why we are approaching this
question carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation
sustainably down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the
historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the
first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately—
prematurely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go to Edward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence with FOX
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from—well, the Federal Reserve is an
independent body, understanding Congress has oversight over that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You received a letter from
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said—calling on you to lower interest
rates—to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too
long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant
climate and economic benefits from these projects.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So has higher interest rates caused that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 13 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Have they—well, first of all, I respect our—you know, in our system
of government, it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We place a
tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them
with great respect.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In this case, I would say, those are, you know—our mandate is for maximum
employment and price stability and the other things that we do, and that’s what we’re trying to
accomplish.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we’re seeing, the
strong labor market we’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly
important, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for
those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying
that the higher rates are squeezing the working people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do these letters affect what you
guys are doing, policy-wise?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses
and address concerns.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system
of government, have oversight over our activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take
that on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”—
which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the
payment system: the things that we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks a lot for the
opportunity to ask a question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the
Page 14 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting
rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to
achieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People do dissent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s something that happens.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Life
goes on, and it’s not a problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve always had dissents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—and so I—you know, you
respect thoughtful dissents very much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but
you really want to understand them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you may read a book that takes a position that you have
long opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I treat dissents with real respect
as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you hear me?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Obviously, inflation is some ways away from
target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Unemployment, though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in
February, we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Are you
concerned at all that—notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth—that in fact there may be
some cracks appearing in the employment market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You talked about a significant deterioration
in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What would constitute that in your books?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We all
monitor the labor market very, very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I don’t see those cracks today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, you
know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but
the overall picture really is a strong labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The extreme imbalances that we saw in the
Page 15 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re seeing high job growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’re seeing big increases in supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’re seeing strong wage growth, but wage growth is
gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In many, many respects, the things are
returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
job openings and quits.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this:
You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How hard is it—how easy it is to find
a worker?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those have both—those surveys have both come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, you do see things like the low—
the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that
would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, initial claims are very, very
low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—watching it carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Don’t see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So,
you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I
think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s just—that’s just people’s
forecast, individual forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
where I’ll leave it, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>STEVE MATTHEWS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned at the
beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the
pace of asset runoff fairly soon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering is—when you say fairly soon, does that mean
that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that
soon?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is
Page 16 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
discussing here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re at $95 billion of caps right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would that be cut about in half or
something in that nature?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not
discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will discuss those in due course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There isn&#39;t much runoff among
MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re talking about going to a lower
pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an
agreement or decision, but that’s the idea.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what we’re looking at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than
that, but you get the idea.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually
be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there can be times when, in the aggregate,
reserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And those parts where they’re not
ample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the
stress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then it would be very hard to restart, we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So something like that happened in
’19 perhaps.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re looking at what would be a good time and what
would be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And will there be a discussion about returning to an all-
Treasuries balance sheet at some point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that
is mostly Treasuries.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other
issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not
Page 17 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
urgent right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to get this, this decision made first and then we can, when the time is
right, come back to the other issues.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also on the balance sheet, you
know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your
balance sheet plans?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you worry that, as deposits start to shrink, that we could see more
turbulence?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ll be watching carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But one of the reasons
we’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we
want to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking-
sector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is our second time in
doing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to
happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle
where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t want to do that again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the
banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the
administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those sorts of
things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, is it also because you’re not sure exactly how the reserve
supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near—at zero?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight
[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet
Page 18 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
shrinks, we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar-for-dollar with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Jean.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask
also about the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Will you—you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a
smaller balance sheet size.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that mean you don’t have to make a decision on when to end
QT at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner, or will you
wait until we’re close to the end?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
that’s the idea.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk
of kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the
process prematurely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully
money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about
reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re
aiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So there isn’t a—
you know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think
we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to be looking at what these—
what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the
ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then, though, you reach a point ultimately
where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s
another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and
that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you have a, you know, a slower pace of
runoff, which we’ll have fairly soon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then you have another time where you effectively hold the
Page 19 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
balance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then that ultimately
brings you, ideally, in for—brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above—you know,
above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not trying for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we
have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did
in 2019 and ’20.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MICHELLE SMITH: Nancy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Chair
Powell, you said you’re waiting to become more confident that inflation’s getting to your
2 percent goal before you cut rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you just sum up more specifically what data you’re
looking at that would give you that confidence?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming
inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the
various components—so obviously that’s what we want.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We want more confidence that
inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, I mean, of course we’ll also be
looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll look at the totality of the
data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the most important thing
will be the inflation data coming in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, are there things that you would give more
weight to, like wages?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages is one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t—our target is not wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s really
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But, but
Page 20 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
they’ve been—wage increases, that’s to say—wage increases have been quite strong, but they’re,
they’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what
we want.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think,
by mostly by wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That wasn’t really the story.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But we do think that, to get inflation back
down to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of
wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Greg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>GREG ROBB.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, could you say
at this meeting whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than—
about rates—than there were at the last meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was there—was there that sense of maybe it’s
smart to wait?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming
inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we
were right to wait until we’re more confident.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone
dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, generally
speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we
approach this question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Brendan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>BRENDAN PEDERSEN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl
News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve been hearing a lot
from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know
you have said to Congress that you’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything—
launches anything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is
Page 21 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you
give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will—
I’ll try harder.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a
conclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to
authorize a digital dollar.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to
give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the
public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re just a long, long way from that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we are doing, and I think what every
major central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital
finance, and it has many, many different areas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has applications in wholesale finance, in the
payment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front
burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we actually
do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on
a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to
spring it on Congress at the right moment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a
decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just think it’s something we
need to be—we need to understand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of
the broader payments landscape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s how I would characterize it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman,
April 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news
conferences.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper
Page 22 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
functioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And is there more that
you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what might that look like?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years
ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the
public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’ll react
to the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and
greater transparency.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman
Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I. You know, so we went from four press conferences a
year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that’s a good innovation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
wouldn’t want to turn it back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also have done a bunch of other things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we have an annual supervision
report, Financial Stability Report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
you—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re very transparent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public
through the media.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that channel is full, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s generally broadly
helped and made things better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But not every day and in every way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, to follow up: Has there ever been a day where you wanted to
put that genie back in the bottle somewhat?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course not. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Jennifer, for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but you did say earlier
in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
Page 23 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not
far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So are you still of
that belief or not?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What are we to take by those words, “not far?”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of
hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that
inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will
be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I said that
any number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We repeated that
today in our statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we
had made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation
that that progress will continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last
year that were really much lower.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s what I had in
mind.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But given that you said that PCE for February,
2.8 percent the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE—core PCE coming down by a tenth
of a percent every month, I mean, wouldn’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June, July,
to a point where you could cut then?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We would, of
course, love to get great inflation data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We got really good inflation data on the second—in the
second part of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Again, we didn’t overreact to it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We said we needed to see more, and
we said it would be bumpy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a
couple of times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly
welcome it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 24 of 24</del></p>
