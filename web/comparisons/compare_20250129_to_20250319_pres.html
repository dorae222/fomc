Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 19, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved
closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also made the technical decision to slow the pace of decline
in the size of our balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say about these decisions after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year,
with GDP rising at 2.3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Recent indications, however, point to a moderation in consumer
spending following the rapid growth seen over the second half of 2024.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Surveys of households
and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It remains to be
seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In our Summary of
Economic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year,
somewhat lower than projected in December, and to rise a bit below 2 percent over the next two
years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged 200,000 per
month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains low and has
held in a narrow range for the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The jobs-to-workers gap has held steady for several
months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in
the pandemic recovery.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor
Page 1 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
market are broadly in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary
pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end
of this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Some
near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see this in both
market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are
mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of
longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median
projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, a
little higher than projected in December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In 2027, the median projection is at our 2 percent
objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Looking
ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is the net effect of these
policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>While there
have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty
around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we parse the incoming
information, we’re focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As
Page 2 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the
target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,
and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward—an admittedly challenging exercise at this time in light of
considerable uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of next
year, unchanged from December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>While these individual forecasts are always subject to
uncertainty, as I noted, uncertainty today is unusually elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, these projections
are not a Committee plan or a decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is not on a preset course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy
stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If
the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward
2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy
accordingly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties
that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, we also decided to slow the pace of decline in our balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Since we began balance sheet runoff, our securities holdings have declined by more than $2
trillion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>While market indicators continue to suggest that the quantity of reserves remains
abundant, we have seen some signs of increased tightness in money markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Beginning in
Page 3 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
April, the monthly cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $25 billion to $5 billion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run,
we are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This action has no implications for our
intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the
medium term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Committee also continued its discussions as part of our five-year review of our
monetary policy framework.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>At this meeting, we focused on labor market dynamics and our
maximum-employment goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we have indicated, our review will include outreach and public
events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a
research conference in May.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical
feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand
that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for your time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
two things on sort of the real side here, one inflation and then—and then GDP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much of the
Page 4 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
higher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs, and since the policy path remains the same,
are you effectively reading this as a one-time price-level shock?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, so how much of it is, is tariffs?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say that it is going to
be very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs
and from, from other—and that’s already the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You may have seen that goods inflation
moved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Trying to track that back to
actual tariff increases, given what was tariffed and what was not—very, very challenging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
some of it—the, the answer is clearly some of it—a good part of it is, is coming from tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
we’ll be—we’ll be working, and so will other forecasters, to try to find the best possible way to
separate nontariff inflation from tariff inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the, the—your, your sort of looking-through question, too soon to say about
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As, as I’ve mentioned, it, it can be the case that it’s appropriate sometimes to look through
inflation if it’s going to go away quickly without action by, by us, if it’s transitory.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that can
be the case in the case of, of tariff inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that would depend on the, the tariff inflation
moving through fairly quickly and would depend critically, as well, on inflation expectations
being well anchored—longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I, I guess I’m looking at the obvious here—the fact that
the policy path doesn’t change at all and inflation is unchanged in the outyears also.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Doesn’t that
imply you all have basically decided that there is no signal here and that it’s just going to—we’re
back to “transitory” again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think—I think that’s kind of the base case, but, as I said, it’s—
we really can’t know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to have to see how things actually, actually work out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the fact that there wasn’t much change—I think that’s, that’s partly because, you know, you
Page 5 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see—you see weaker growth but higher inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They kind of offset.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, frankly, a little
bit of inertia when it—when it comes to changing something in this highly uncertain
environment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you’re—you, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you
just say, “Maybe I’ll stay where I am.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby Smith with the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You just
described inflation expectations as well anchored, but has your confidence in that assessment
changed at all, given the increase in certain measures and the high degree of uncertainty
expressed by businesses, households, and forecasters?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So our inflation expectations—of course, we do monitor inflation
expectations very, very carefully—basically, every source we can find, and, you know—short-
term, long-term, households, businesses, forecasters, market-based.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think the picture,
broadly, is this: You do see increases widely in short-term inflation expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And people
who fill out surveys and answer, you know, questionnaires are pointing to tariffs about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If
you look—in the survey world, if you look a little further out, you, you really—you really don’t
see much in the way of an increased longer-term inflation—inflation expectations are mostly
well anchored, if you look at the [series maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of] New York,
for example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then you have market based, and it’s the same pattern.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, people and
markets are pricing in and, and breakevens, some higher inflation over the next year must be
related to tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know from the surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you look out five years or five-year, five-
year forward, you’ll see that breakevens have—are either flat or, actually, slightly down in the
case of a longer-term one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So we look at that, and we will be watching all of it very, very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do not take
anything for granted.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s at the very heart of our framework: anchored inflation
expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what—that’s what you see right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and how much weight do you put on the deterioration in
consumer confidence surveys?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You said recently that this is perhaps not the best indication of
future spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I’m curious, you know, what you think is behind this deterioration and, and
to what extent it could be a leading indicator for hard data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let’s start with the hard data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we do see pretty
solid hard data still.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So growth looks like it’s maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending
moderating a bit, but still at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Unemployment’s 4.1 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job creation, most
recently, has been at a healthy level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has started to move up now, we think partly in
response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s the hard data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, it’s a solid picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The, the survey data, [in the case of] both
household and businesses, show significant rise in uncertainty and significant concerns about
downside risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So how do we think about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—that is the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned the other day, as you pointed out, the relationship between survey data
and actual economic activity hasn’t been very tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There have been plenty of times where
people are saying very down—downbeat things about the economy and then going out and
buying a new car.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we don’t know that that will be the case here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will be watching very
carefully for signs of weakness in the real data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course we will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I, I—you know, given
where we are, we think our policy’s in a good place to react to, to what comes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think
that the right thing to do is, is to wait here for, you know, for greater clarity about, about what,
what the economy’s doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 28

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Chair Powell, Chair
Greenspan once defined price stability as, as an environment in which inflation is so low and
stable over time that it doesn’t materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Can
you say that today we have that price stability—that households and businesses are ignoring
price growth, or do you see, by an advanced psychology, big changes in inventories and surveys
that show consumers, at least in the short run, expect higher inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I do like that definition a lot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In fact, I used it at the recent
conference where I spoke.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think a world where, where people can make their daily
economic decisions, and businesses, and they’re not having to think about the possibility of
significantly high inflation—we know inflation will bounce around.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s, that is price
stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say we were at
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation was running around 2½ percent for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I do think with the arrival of, of
the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed, if the SEP doesn’t really show further
downward progress on inflation this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that, that’s really due to the tariffs coming in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, delayed, but if you look at our forecast, we do see ourselves getting back into the low 2s in
’26 and then down to 2 [percent] by ’27—of course, highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I see progress having,
having been made toward that, and then progress in the future.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that progress is probably
delayed for the time being.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If that’s the case, why are there cuts in the SEP for 2025?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, again, people wrote down two cuts the last time, and they look
at—they look at the—you know, the—and they wrote down, you know, meaningful decline in
growth out from 2.1 to 1.7 in 2025, a tick up in the unemployment rate, so not much there, but
Page 8 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
core inflation up by three-tenths.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so those two kind of—those kind of balance each other
out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So people—not everybody, but, on balance, people wrote down similar numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
changes aren’t that big.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other—the other factor, though, as I mentioned, is just really high uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What
would you write down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s just—it’s really hard to know how this is going to work out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, we think our policy’s in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think it’s a good place where we can
move in the direction that—where we need to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in the meantime, we, we—it’s, it’s really
appropriate to wait for further clarity, and, of course, you know, the costs of doing that, given
that the economy is still solid, are very low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So with near 4 percent unemployment rate, that should be low enough to bring people
in from the sidelines in terms of hiring.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re seeing the hiring rates have been stuck at
2023, 2024 levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, what’s going on there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so that’s a feature of the—has been for some time, a feature of
this labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You have pretty high participation, accounting for aging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’ve got wages
that are consistent with 2 percent inflation, assuming that we’re going to keep getting, you know,
relatively high productivity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve got unemployment, you know, pretty close to its natural
level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But job—the hiring rate is quite low, but so is the layoff rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the, the—you look at
initial claims or layoffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re not seeing people losing their jobs, but you’re seeing that
people who don’t have a job having to wait longer and longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, the question is,
which way does that break?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we were to see a meaningful increase in layoffs, then that would
probably translate fairly quickly into unemployment, because people are—you know, it’s, it’s
Page 9 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a—it’s not a big hiring market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve been watching that, and it’s just not in the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
hasn’t happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we’ve had is, is a low-firing, low-hiring situation, and it seems to be in
balance now for, you know, for the last six, seven, eight months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s where we are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s
healthy levels of job creation, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, overall, it’s a labor market that’s in balance, and, you
know, we, we watch it very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So then, have we seen the Administration—the new
Administration’s policies in the economic numbers yet?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And when do you anticipate that
happening?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In labor?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or in, in other—?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In labor and inflation, just across the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Have we
started to see the new policies take effect in the numbers?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, you know, only in a—kind of an early way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s only been
a few months, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, for example, the, the layoffs that are happening here are, you
know, they’re certainly meaningful to the people involved, and they may be meaningful to a
particular neighborhood or region or area, but at the national level, they’re not—they’re not
significant yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know what—where that—how far that will go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll, we’ll find out much more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mentioned that—you, you saw it—we’ve had two, two very strong goods inflation
readings in the last two months, which is very unexpected, and, I think, hard to trace it to specific
tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it must have—it must have something to do with—it’s either noise and it’ll come
back, and that—that’s very possible, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if it is persistent, then it must be to do with, you
know, people buying ahead of tariffs, or raising prices ahead of tariffs, and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That—those kinds of things happen, and they’re very, very hard to capture because so much of it
Page 10 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is indirect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>A great example is there—washing machines were tariffed in the last, last round of
tariffs, and prices went up, but prices also went up on, on dryers, which were not tariffed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the
manufacturers just, you know, they just kind of followed the crowd and, and raised it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So things
happen very indirectly, and so there’ll be a lot of work done in the coming months to, to try to
trace all that through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, ultimately, though, it’s too soon to be seeing significant effects in
economic data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CRAIG TORRES.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
said transitory price increases from tariffs are the base case—transitory is the base case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wasn’t
it the base case last time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And didn’t the FOMC forecast lower inflation ahead last time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
wasn’t the lesson that it quickly got into services, haircuts, daycare, everything else?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I’m
just wondering why the nine aren’t taking that on board and are cutting twice this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When you say “last time,” are you talking about the last—
CRAIG TORRES.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Pandemic, yes—during the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You could have been talking about the last time there were tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In which case, the inflation was, was transitory.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No—of course, we’re well aware of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know,
it’s, it’s still the truth, if, if there’s an inflationary impulse that’s going to go away on its own, it’s
not the right policy to, to tighten policy, because by the time you have your effect, you’re—you
know, you’re—an effect that by—by design, you are lowering economic activity and
employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if that’s not necessary, you don’t want to do it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In real time, as we know, it’s

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
hard to make that judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and, and we’re well aware, you know, of what happened,
obviously, with, with the pandemic inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, I mean, we have to look at this as a—as a
different situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s, there are differences and similarities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s a different time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, we haven’t had real price stability fully reestablished yet, and we have to keep that in
mind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, you know, we also have—we hear that people are very reluctant to take on—to, you
know, to, to allow prices to go up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, we hear that businesses are intending to
pass many of these prices through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s hard to say how this is going to work out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve, Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking my question,
Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Bank of Canada in its last policy statement said, “Monetary policy cannot
offset the impacts of a trade war.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What it can and must do is ensure that higher prices do not
lead to ongoing inflation.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wonder if that kind of reflects your own sense of prioritization,
faced with higher prices and weaker growth—that the idea is, you have to take care of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know—so we, we have two goals, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We have maximum
employment and price stability, and we have to balance those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there can be
situations in which they are in tension, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we have, actually have a provision in our—in
our consensus statement that says what we should do in that case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a very challenging, you
know, situation for, for any central bank, and certainly for us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, what we say that we’ll do
is, we’ll, we’ll look how far each of those two goals is—each of those two measures is from its
goal, and then we’ll ask how long we think it might take to get back to the goal for each of them,
and we’ll make a judgment, because our, you know, our tools work in one direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re
either tightening or loosening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a very challenging situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let me say, we don’t have
that situation right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not what the—that’s not where the economy is at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also
Page 12 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not where the forecast is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know any mainstream forecast that really shows significant
problems like that, so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, just to follow up, yesterday the UCLA Anderson Forecast said
there’s—a high probability of a recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where, where do you stand on whether or not the
slowdown you’re seeing creates a higher probability or concern that you may have on recession?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, there’s always an unconditional probability—possibility
of, of a recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It might be broadly in the range of one in four at any time, if you look back
through, through the years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It—there could be, within 12 months, a one in four chance of a
recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the question is, is whether that—whether this current situation, those possibilities
are elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will say this: We don’t—we don’t make such a forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at outside
forecasts, forecasters have, have generally raised—a number of them have raised their possibility
of a—of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate levels—you know, still in the
region of, of the traditional, because they were extremely low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you go back two months,
people were saying that the, the likelihood of a recession was extremely low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, has moved up,
but it’s not high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As
you know, I guess, last night the—President Trump fired two members of the Federal Trade
Commission, an independent agency, and this could cause the kind of legal fight about the
Administration’s power to fire independent people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If those firings stand, is that a threat to the
Fed’s independence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could he do the same thing to the Fed Board?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 13 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think I, I did answer that question in this very room some time
ago, and I, I [have] no desire to change that answer and have nothing new for you on that today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I just—okay, well, maybe I’ll have another
mulligan. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Laughter] As you know, I, I wanted to go back to the consumer sentiment,
particularly the inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the summer of
2022, you cited the rise in the long-term inflation expectations in that index as the reason that
you went big with a three-quarter-point hike.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I know you’ve—I mean, you’ve talked about
all the different measures now, but you seem to not be placing the same weight on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
I’m just wondering, are you dismissing that, what we saw last week from the University of
Michigan, or does that carry the same weight as it did in the past?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I mentioned it back then, but in no way did I place a huge
weight on it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it, it—that was an ex post story, but it wasn’t the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was a
preliminary reading, and so is this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s also—this is—that, that Michigan, the one you’re
referring to, the longer-term thing—you know, we look at it, and we don’t dismiss data that we
don’t like.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we force ourselves to look at it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it is an outlier compared to market-based
and compared to other survey-based assessments of longer-run inflation expectations, so we’ve
got to keep that in mind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I—again, I, I would just say, we look at—we look at all of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that one—that one’s kind of an outlier, but, you know, nonetheless, we, we take notice of it.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>

may see on the economy that you would end up waiting too long and be “behind the curve” in

responding to any downturn.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How can you reassure people that you can spot a problem early
enough, unless you decide to be preemptive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, look, we’re, we’re aware of the—we’re well aware of how
things are going to evolve and the time frames and all that, and, you know, we will—we will use
our tools to foster achievement of our goals to the—to the best we can.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, we’re
going to try to be timely with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For right now, the hard data are pretty solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we are
obviously aware of the soft sentiment data and high uncertainty, and we’re watching that
carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think it’s a, a good time for us to wait for further clarity before we consider
adjusting our, our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you think it’s going to be hard to get clarity in a “government
by tweet”?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, do you have a, a feeling that at some point you actually will have a forecast
you can trust?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, I think we will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just—it’s hard to say when that will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
know, we’re—these decisions are going to be made, and they’re going to be implemented, and
then we’ll know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At that point, we’ll know what the decisions are, and we’ll have to make
assessments then about their, their implications for the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those things will happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A
lot of them will happen over the course of, you know, in coming months, certainly over the
course of this year, and we’ll be adapting as we go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rachel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>RACHEL SIEGEL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank
you for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the beginning, you were talking about separating the signal
from the noise, and tariff inflation from nontariff inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you “walk us through” what that
Page 15 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
looked like over the last couple of months—if there were specifics, from the January meeting to
now, that helped you make those distinctions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when we say “separating the signal from the noise,” that’s just a
way of saying that things are highly uncertain and that, you know, you’re reading about
developments—the news is full of developments of tariffs being put on and taken off and things
like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s—some of that is noise in the sense that it’s, it’s not really telling you anything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re trying to extract a signal from that, and the signal is what’s going to be the effect on
economic activity, on inflation, on employment, and all those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so that’s really when
we say “signal and noise.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, the second thing was—?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or, similarly for tariff inflation, nontariff inflation, ways that you’re
making the distinction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s sort of a, a special case of that—of, you know, with the
idea being—and I think—do think that the first two months of this year are a great example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got high readings for goods inflation after a string of readings that averaged close to
zero, and you have to ask—it’s coming during tariffs, but, you know, you—it’s very hard to,
actually, scientifically go back and match up those increases and say, “Yes, I can prove that
that’s from tariffs.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it kind of has to be, to some extent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Plus, noise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There can be
idiosyncratic readings in various categories, which will shortly reverse, and that, that happens,
too, and that could be a big piece of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I think we’ll know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In a couple of months,
we’ll know whether those were—you know, where that really was from.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s a—that’s
another case where I think it’s going to be very, very challenging to unpack the inflation that we
see over the course of this year and be able to say with confidence how much of that came from
Page 16 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation and how much of it—sorry, from tariffs—and how much of it didn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s what
we’ll be doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be doing that, and so will everybody else, and we’ll all be trying very hard
to, to make that assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I, I’m sure we will make a lot of progress on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we already have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it, it’s going to be a challenge.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you have a sense yet as to what, in your mind, what makes
something cross from noise to a signal—what that threshold would look like?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it would depend on what we’re talking about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean,
obviously, you’re looking for direct evidence that, that particular pieces of, of inflation are, are—
or are clearly not—caused by tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For example, something that was, you know, in the service
sector that was far away from anything that’s tariffed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You, you might think, okay, well that is—
like, frankly, housing services inflation—which, which, by the way, has been behaving well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know—which, for, for some time, was kind of our problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now it’s been—it’s slow, but
it’s definitely, you know, moving down in a—in a very good way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s more now with goods
and, to some extent, with, with nonhousing services inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kelly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KELLY O’GRADY.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kelly O’Grady,
CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So consumer sentiment has dipped dramatically, but you say the economy and the
hard data is still solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is your message to consumers that clearly disagree and don’t feel
that strength?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Because the hard data they’re looking at is their grocery bill.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, so a couple things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The grocery bill is about, about past
inflation, really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There was inflation in ’21, ’22, and ’23, and prices went up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The current
level—it’s not the change in prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s, they’re unhappy—and, and they’re not wrong to be
unhappy—that prices went up quite a bit, and they’re paying a lot for those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—I
Page 17 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think that is the fundamental fact and has been for a long time—a couple years—why people are
unhappy with the—with the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not that the economy’s not growing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s not that
inflation’s really high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s not that unemployment is high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s none of those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have,
you know, 4.1 percent unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve got 2 percent growth, and, you know, it’s, it’s a
pretty good economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But people are unhappy because of the price level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and I do—we
completely understand and accept that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow up: Why are you still projecting two rate cuts
this year if your own projections show inflation higher for longer?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Does that mean you see a
slowdown in economic growth as a real threat?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think if you—yeah, I mean, remember, we came into this
with—at the December meeting, and the median was two cuts, the median was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so you
come in, and you see, broadly speaking, weaker growth but higher inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they kind of
balance each other out, so you think—and, and unemployment is really, really only, only a one-
tenth change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s—there’s just not a big change in the forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There really isn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Modest,
you know, meaningfully higher growth and meaningfully higher inflation, which call for
different responses, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So they cancel each other out, and people just said, “Okay, I’m going
to stay here.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the second factor is, it’s so highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is just—you know, we’re sitting here
thinking—and we, we obviously are in, in touch with businesses and households all over the
country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have an extraordinary network of contacts that come in through the Reserve Banks
and put it in the Beige Book—and also through contacts at the Board.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we get all that, and
we, we do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not
yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’re watching carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would tell people that the economy seems to be—
Page 18 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seems to be healthy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that, that sentiment is, is quite negative at this time, and that
probably has to do with, you know, turmoil at the beginning of an Administration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s making,
you know, big changes in, in areas of policy, and that’s probably part of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do think the
underlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more—is more about the
price level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>VICTORIA GUIDA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask, first of all, if
you could clarify.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You were talking about how tariffs were a good part of the uptick in the
inflation forecasts, and I was just wondering what that specifically refers to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that the tariffs
that have already been put in place?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that anticipating some of the tariffs that might be coming
on April 2?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then also, if you wouldn’t mind talking a little more about the balance sheet
decision and what drove that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Did that have anything to do with expectations of how the debt
ceiling—raising the debt ceiling might affect the reserve supply?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Yeah, so, in the SEP, you’ll see that there’s not further progress on
core inflation this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re kind of side flatlining, going sideways.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t ask people to
say—to write down how much of this is from tariffs and how much of it is not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But some of it is
from tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that tariffs are coming, and we know that they’re probably already—all,
all forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core PCE inflation [and] core CPI inflation this year,
without exception.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not aware of an exception.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s in there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can’t tell you how much of
that it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the balance sheet—so, yeah, we—I think—I guess the way I’d say it is, you
know, it was the flows in and out of the, the TGA that got us thinking about it, but as we, you
know, as we thought about it, we really came to the view that this was a good time to, to make
Page 19 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the move that we made.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, broadly, Committee came around—came around to the view that
we, we would do the same thing we’d already done, which is, once we—I guess in June, we—
was it June?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Whenever it was, we, we lowered the pace of QT, and we’re just going to do that
again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to cut it roughly in half.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the sense of that is, if you’re cutting the pace
of QT roughly in half, then the runway is probably doubled, okay?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s going—it’s going to
be slower for longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And people really liked that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People thought, “That’s, that’s a good idea.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s like a plane.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can think of it like a plane coming in for a landing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we get
closer and we—by the way, we still think that reserves are abundant, although you begin to see
some of the—some of the things we look at begin to react a little bit, but we still think that
they’re abundant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, now, the TGA is emptying out, so reserves are, are higher
now, so you can’t really see the underlying signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we came around to the view, and, and it
had a lot of appeal, and so we did it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It really—it has no implications at all for monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has no implications at all for the ultimate size of the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It isn’t sending a signal in
any hidden way that you can try to tease out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just not there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re basically—it’s
very consistent with our plans and our practices that we’ve published and that we’ve followed
since we began this—what is a very successful, you know, rundown of the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again,
[this is] the second time that we’ve slowed the pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve said that we would stop when
we were somewhat above the level [of reserves] we judge as ample.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, clearly, we’re not at
that level yet, but we’re going to be approaching it more slowly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a commonsense kind of a—
kind of a thing, and it had—it had pretty broad appeal, I will say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You said in January, Chair Powell,
that inflation expectations remained well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you still say they remain well
Page 20 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
anchored today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to reiterate the question others have asked, if they’re not so well
anchored, why hasn’t there been a more radical shift to the policy path today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when we—when we talk about inflation expectations being well
anchored, we’re talking about longer-run inflation expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they really haven’t moved
much, I mean, if at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There, there’s one reading that everyone’s focusing on that’s higher, but
the other survey readings and the market-based readings all show relatively, you know, well-
anchored inflation expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You would expect that expectations of inflation over the course
of a year would move around, because conditions change, and in this case, we have tariffs
coming in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know how big, what’s—there’s so many things we don’t know, but we
kind of know there are going to be tariffs, and they tend to bring growth down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They tend to
bring inflation up at the—in the first instance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so I would say, you, you know, I’m not
dismissing what we’re seeing in short-term inflation expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, as I mentioned, follow
that very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But when we say expectations are well anchored, we’re really looking at,
you know, longer term, five year and out, and there’s really no story to tell five years and out,
either in market based or, or in surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we keep—we’ll watch it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we’re not, you
know, we’re, we’re not going to miss any evidence that longer-term or medium-term inflation
expectations are, are moving.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin with Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Treasury Secretary Bessent has
observed that a large share of job growth over the last couple of years has been in what he calls
government or government-adjacent sectors—health care, education.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you agree that there’s
some weakness in underlying private job growth, and do you see the composition of job growth
as something that has policy implications?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 21 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that has been the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We talked about that over the course
of the last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There were—there were some good number of months and times when a lot of
the job creation was, was concentrated in, you know, educational institutions, health care, state
governments, things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>There were also times when private-sector job growth has been
moving, moving in a healthy frame—and they’re all—they’re all jobs, but—and remember,
we’re, you know, we’re at very low unemployment for, you know, for, for quite a time now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
I, I think it’s a good labor market, but it’s—look, it’s something that we monitor carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>From
our standpoint, employment is employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But I, you know—the, the elected government is
entitled to have—you know, we, we don’t have policies that address different kinds of
employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but the elected government has a—has a different role, and they can—they,
they can have those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Quick QT question: Does the Committee envision at some point
tapering the MBS runoff, runoff as well?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think tapering it—I, I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s no plan to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
know, at a certain point, we’ll stop runoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we may or may not stop MBS runoff, though,
because, you know, we can—we can—we, we want to stop runoff in net at some point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
haven’t made any decisions about that, but, you know, we, we want the—we want the MBS to
roll off our balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We really, strongly desire that, so—but we haven’t made any
decisions about that, you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we will—we—I think we’d, we’d look carefully at letting
that keep going, but hold the overall size of the balance sheet in, you know, constant, at some
point—a point that we’re not at yet.</strong></em></p>

SIMON RABINOVITCH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chair
Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Several times today, you’ve said that you feel you’re well positioned to wait for greater
clarity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At the same time, you could point to quite a few growth risks at the moment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve
seen a stock market that’s gone quite wobbly, rapidly cooling housing sales, plunging confidence
surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, not only did the SEP mark down the growth outlook, 17 of 19 see risks to the
downside.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So my question is, how confident are you that you’re well positioned?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or is that one
more thing that you’re uncertain about?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m confident that we’re well positioned in the sense that we’re,
we’re well positioned to move in the direction we’ll need to move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I mean, I, I don’t know
anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the point is, we are—we are at, you
know, we’re at a place where we can cut or we—or we can hold what is a clearly a restrictive
stance of policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what I mean.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I mean, I think we’re—that’s well positioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Forecasting right now, it’s—you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current
situation, I just think it’s—uncertainty is, you know, remarkably high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, sorry, standing here today, would you be surprised to, to
pivot back towards rate cuts in May?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, like, I, I think we’re not going to be in any hurry to move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as
I mentioned, I think we’re, we’re well positioned to wait for further clarity, and not in any hurry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Matt Egan with CNN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The Fed’s statement
released today removed the line that previously said “the Committee judges that the risks to
achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you explain the
Page 23 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
decision to remove that line?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Does it mean that you’re now more concerned about inflation or
about employment?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Actually, it does not mean either of those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
sometimes with language they—it, it lives its, its useful life, and then we take it off, and we—
and, and that was the case there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s really not meant to be any signal here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past
year, you know, conveying this sense of the balance of risks was important that they be in
balance or close to being in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was useful as we approach liftoff, if you remember.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re past that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or, I’m sorry, no—beginning, beginning to cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we just—so we just
took it out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I actually would say that the more important thing now about risks—and this is in,
in pages like 10, 11, 12 of the SEP—if you look, participants widely raised their estimate of, of
the risks to our—of uncertainty, but also of the risks to growth in our employment and inflation
mandates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s a more salient point now than whether they’re—whether they’re in
balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just on the, the stock market, the stock market has obviously declined
significantly since the Fed last met.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you concerned at all about some of the market volatility
having a real economic impact in terms of hurting business spending or consumer spending,
especially among higher-income households?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So financial conditions matter to us because, you know, financial
conditions are the main channel to the real economy through which our policy has its effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
so they’re important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what matters from, from a Fed standpoint for the macroeconomy is
material changes to overall financial conditions that are persistent, that last for a while—long
enough to actually affect economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what we’re looking for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I’m not going
to opine on the appropriate level of any market—equity, debt, commodities, or anything like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 24 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And I would just point you to the—to the bigger picture again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the, the real
economy, the, the hard data are still in, in reasonably good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s the soft data—it’s the
surveys that are showing, you know, significant concerns, downside risks, and those kind of
things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t dismiss that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re watching it carefully, but, you know, we, we don’t want to
get ahead of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we want to focus on the hard data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This—if it’s—if that’s
going to affect the hard data, we should know it very quickly, and, and, of course, we’ll, we’ll
understand that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you don’t see that yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you look to navigate higher inflation and lower growth, the Fed has talked
about heeding the lessons from the 1970s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the Fed willing to have a recession if it means
breaking the back of inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, fortunately, we’re in a situation where we have seen inflation
move down from, you know, higher levels to pretty close to 2 percent, while the unemployment
rate has remained very consistent with full employment, 4.1 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we now have inflation
coming in from an exogenous source, but the underlying inflationary picture before that was, you
know, basically 2½ percent inflation, I would say, and 2 percent growth, and 4 percent
unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so that’s what—that’s what we did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what, together, the economy
accomplished.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t see any reason to think that we’re looking at, at a replay of the ’70s or
anything like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, inflation—underlying inflation is, is, you know, still running in
the 2s, with probably a little bit of a pickup associated with tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I don’t think we’re
facing—I, I wouldn’t say we’re in, in a situation that’s remotely comparable to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 25 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And last month, the idea of a DOGE dividend was
proposed, which would send $5,000 checks to every taxpayer from DOGE savings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>President
Trump and Elon Musk have supported this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s reports there could be a bill introduced on
Capitol Hill.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What impact might that have on household savings and spending in terms of your
growth and, and outlook for inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I—it’s not—it’s not appropriate for me to speculate on
political ideas or, or fiscal policy, for that matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m going to—I’m going to pass on that
one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Daniel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>DANIEL AVIS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You
mentioned that tariffs are already having at least some impact on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m just wondering
how you and your colleagues on the FOMC have been thinking about the possibility of
retaliatory tariffs from other countries, especially with April 2 coming up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was it something you
considered during this meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, since the very beginning, we’ve had kind of a placeholder—the
staff has a placeholder of—range of—really a range of possible outcomes from tariffs, and from
trade policy generally.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they generally assume full retaliation in those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that’s, that’s
kind of baked into the numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What happens—it will be complicated, and there will be some
retaliation and some not and, and all that, but, ultimately, they’re trying to, with the placeholder,
give us a broad sense of what this might look like.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This—when we know—when we actually
know the specifics, we’ll be able to, to have still uncertain but, you know, better-informed
forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so, yes, that’s in there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Last question goes to Jean.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 26 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEAN YUNG.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Had a couple
questions on the balance sheet change that you made.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the minutes had initially described
your discussion on slowing QT as temporary, until the debt ceiling is resolved, but it—from what
you said earlier, doesn’t sound like there’s a desire to kind of regain the pace of QT that we have
at the moment after the, the debt ceiling is resolved.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that the case?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Yeah, so we, we looked at pausing, and we looked at, at slowing,
and, really, people came together very strongly behind slowing, not pausing, for a variety of
reasons.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so people really came to be, you know, pretty strongly in favor of, of this move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
slows down the path and probably lengthens it—you know, doubles it, effectively, by slowing it
by half.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s—people thought that’s, that’s a good place to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’ll, it’ll, you know,
help us assure that this path is, is a smooth one as we get closer and closer to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how
that came about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEAN YUNG.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I guess my question is more, was that meant to be a temporary
measure during the debt ceiling episode, or—?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it was—it was actually—it was the, the TGA flows—
Treasury General Account flows that got us thinking about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the more we thought about
it, we came around to this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, it, it is—yes, it was provoked.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The original
discussion was provoked by that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think what we came up with, though, was broader than
that and different than it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It does address that issue, but it really is also—it fits in really nicely
with our principles and our plans, and the things we’ve done before, and the things we’ve said
we would do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s why I—you know, pretty, pretty strong support.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d just say it’s, it’s
nothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with the size of the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just
kind of a commonsense adjustment as you get closer and closer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s slow down a little bit
Page 27 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, that way, we’ll be more and more confident that we’re getting where we need to get.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can take your time getting there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re shrinking the balance sheet every
month, and we think that’s—we think it was a good play and, as I mentioned, well supported.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks very much.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
January 29, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is strong—is strong overall and has made significant
progress toward our goals over the past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor market conditions have cooled from
their formerly overheated state and remain solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more
to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>For 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer
spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter
but was strong for the year overall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the
housing sector seems to have stabilized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per
month over the past three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has
stabilized since the middle of last year and, at 4.1 percent in December, remains low.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal
wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, a
wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The
labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
Page 1 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on
both sides of our mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full
percentage point from its peak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light
of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With our policy stance
significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need
to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering the extent and timing of additional
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not on any preset course.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes
our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy remains—economy
remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can
Page 2 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
maintain policy restraint for longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or
inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is
well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our
dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we previously announced, our five-year review, review of our monetary policy
framework is taking place this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by
reviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the
experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our review will again include
outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events
around the country and a research conference in May.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Throughout this process, we will be open
to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in
determining our findings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would note that
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be a focus
of the review.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-run inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to your questions.</del></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, all
right, at an event in Davos—or from, to Davos, anyway—the President said he’ll demand that
interest rates drop immediately.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I have a three-part question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Has the President done
this to you?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Has he made that demand?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Secondly, what is your response to that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, third,
what effect, if anything—if any, does a President making these kind of remarks have on policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Three questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m seeing, seeing it really as one question, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I, I’m not going to have—I’m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever
on, on what the President’s said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not appropriate for me to do so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The public should be
confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have—focusing on using our tools
to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s how we
best serve the public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you just comment on whether he’s physically communicated
his demand to you?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve had no contact.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, you and
several of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was
“meaningfully restrictive.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given economic and financial market developments since then, how
has your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully
restrictive?</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think that my assessment really has changed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, a
couple of things have happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve gotten more strong data, but we’ve also seen rates move
up at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think if we look
back over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If you look at the effect of
high rates on interest-sensitive spending—for example, in housing—and if you look at the
achievement of our goal variables, we’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation
and, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Though we literally look at the—at
the—at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, policy is
meaningfully less restrictive than it was before we began to cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s 100 basis points less
restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on
inflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we—before we consider
making adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does the economy here warrant meaningfully
restrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if
you were to lower them by another ¼ point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I, I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I
mentioned, to balance the achievement of our two—of our two goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We, we want to—policy
to be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation
goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>At the same time, we don’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve
that goal, and that’s kind of what we’ve been getting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The labor market has really been broadly
stable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Conditions seem to
be broadly in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see
we don’t—we don’t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, nonetheless, the
Page 5 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last couple of readings have suggested, you know, more positive readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think we’re—I
think policy’s well, well positioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby, from the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby Smith, with the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, how should we
interpret the removal of the line from the statement that inflation has made progress towards the
2 percent goal?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that no longer the case?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, so let me look—if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a
little bit of language cleanup there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We took out a reference to “since earlier in the year” as it
related to the labor market, and we just chose to, to shorten that sentence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, I, I mean, if
you look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was—there was another
inflation reading, I guess, just before the December meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, we’ve got two, two good
readings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Again, we’re not going to
overinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than
this: You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving
our 2 percent inflation goal sustainably.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And just to follow up: We’ve seen inflation expectations across a
number of measures rise sharply—which has, in part, been linked to tariff concerns.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But there’s
also been this encouraging data that you mentioned in terms of CPI and rent indices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So how
would you characterize concerns about upside risks to inflation across the Committee, especially
those tied to policies related to the Trump Administration?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well I, I’d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the
short end—but not at the longer run, which [is] where it really matters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And those could be
related to—could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think where the
Page 6 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, and we,
we don’t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with
regulatory policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re only just beginning to see—actually, are not really beginning to see
much, and I think we need to—we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even
begin to make a, a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
we’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is no different than any
other set of policy changes at the beginning of a—of an Administration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll patiently watch
and understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of
understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You and
your colleagues normally condition future policy moves with the phrase, “if the economy
develops as we anticipate.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it fair to say that since there’s a lot unknown about what this
Administration’s fiscal policies are actually going to be that you don’t have a medium- to long-
term economic forecast that you can have confidence in?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or, if that’s not true, can you lay out
what you think is going to happen in the economy, how you see it developing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, at all times—at all times, forecasts are conditional, at a
minimum, on just a set of expectations, and, and they’re highly uncertain in both directions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We,
we know that economic forecasting is, is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So in
the current situation, there’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of, of, you know,
significant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned: tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal
policy, and, and regulatory policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that
should be passing; we should go through that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then we’ll be back to the regular amount of
Page 7 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, what, what forecasters are doing—not just us, but everybody’s doing—is
they’ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they’re really kind of
in the nature of a placeholder, and—meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you
wouldn’t stand behind it because you just don’t know, and so you’re just—you’re just on hold,
waiting to see what comes down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s, it’s a very large economy, and policies affect
it at the margin, but we’ll, you know, we’re going to wait and see.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The idea that you feel the—that policy is
restrictive suggests that the Fed, in general, wants to continue to lower interest rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when
you look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can
cut or data that will tell you [that] you should hold?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re—we’re looking—it’s more the other—the way—
the way it works is, we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know,
that, that’s what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy’s well
positioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy’s in, in quite a good place, actually, as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And what, what we do
expect is to see further progress on inflation, and, you know, as I mentioned, as we see that—or
if we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster—we could then be in a position
of, of making further adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, right now, we, we don’t see that, and we see things as in
a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a
hurry to, to make any adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you very much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
2021, at a central bank conference, you said, quote, “Throughout my career in both public and
private sectors, I’ve seen that the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that
Page 8 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These organizations
consistently attract the best talent by investing in and retaining a world-class workforce.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Question, first question is, do you still believe that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if so, how do you intend to put that
belief into practice while remaining consistent with the recent executive order prohibiting
diversity and inclusion efforts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say, “yes,” in answer to your first question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, to the
second question, I want to say this: We are, like others, we’re reviewing the orders and the
associated details as they are made available.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as has been our practice over many
Administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate
and consistent with applicable law.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I want to add that I’m not going to have anything more
specific for you today on this whole set of issues.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, if I could just follow up quickly on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering
how you’re getting that to be consistent with the Dodd-Frank law’s stipulations about
maintaining an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I did—I did mention “consistent with applicable law,” right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Which is governing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Elizabeth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks so much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just to
follow up on Steve’s question, what reassurance can you give the American public that the Fed
will continue to operate independent of politics under this Administration?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I’ve—as I’ve said countless times over the years, this
is—this is who we are; this is what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We study the data, we, we analyze how it will affect
the outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,
Page 9 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
our best thinking, try to achieve our goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we do; that’s always what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Don’t
look for us to do anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—you know, lots of research shows that’s the—that’s
the best way for a central bank to operate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’ll give us the best possible chance to achieve
these goals for the benefit of the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s always what we’re going to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
people should have confidence in that, as I—as I said a few minutes ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve said that the Fed is in wait-and-see mode, based on
the policies that come out of this Administration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Has the Fed started to model what policies like
mass deportations, changes in immigration policy, specifically, would look like for the
workforce and for inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So one of the things our, our staff does is they, they look at a range
of possible outcomes, and, and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you
know, it’s, it’s one of the best things that they do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And in each Tealbook—you can look at the
five-year-old Tealbooks and see their alternative simulations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what they do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They, it’ll
be a baseline, and then they’ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones
and, and not-so-good ones.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to
sort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
yes, we, we—staff does that, and we, we’re all well aware that there are—that the range of
possibilities is always broad, and—not just now, but always.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you have to—it’s hard to be
open to just how, how broad the possibilities are for an economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, no one saw the
pandemic coming, and it was—you know, it changed everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So things happen, and—but
yes, we do—we do do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what
might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’t act until
you—until you see much more than we see now.</del></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CATARINA SARAIVA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, last month
you talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more
progress in inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would
you say that that’s even more so the case now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d say it’s the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, we, we want to see, you know,
further progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the story’s there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s—we’re just going to
have to see the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the end of the day, it, it comes down to 12-month inflation, because that
takes out the seasonality issues that may exist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’re, we’re just going to need
to see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think that—we think we see the pathway for that to happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One, one
example—a key example—is that you now do see owner’s equivalent rent and, you know,
housing services—the way it’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty
steadily now, and that’s the—that’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
addition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services
[prices], which don’t tend to send much signal [about future inflation].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you can look through
all that and, and think, “Okay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But being
seem to set up for it is one thing; having it is another.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we, we’re going to want to see further,
further progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember, we’re not, you know, we’re, we’re under—2 percent,
but our goal is 2 percent, and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and in terms of the labor market, I mean, how—is that
broadly—you know, you said a broad set of indicators show that it’s in pretty solid place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was
there broad agreement on that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s been a few underlying indicators that are showing
Page 11 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
perhaps some weakness: a low hiring rate, you know, workers reporting that it’s increasingly
difficult to find a job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that of concern to the Committee?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we look at, of course, a very broad range.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, so, it starts with unemployment—sorry, with, yeah, with the unemployment rate,
employment participation, wages, job quits—are people quitting?—that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The ratio
of vacancies to unemployed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger, though,
on—it’s a low—it’s a low-hiring environment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if you have a job, it’s all—it’s all good, but if
you—if you have to find a job, the job-finding rate—the hiring rates have come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And
that’s, that’s more typical of a—let’s say—let’s say that the unemployment—that the—that the
labor market is at a sustainable level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not overheated anymore.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t think we need it to
cool off anymore.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do watch it extremely carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s one of our two goal variables.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But,
yeah, I, I’d say we watch those things quite carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But nonetheless, overall, look at the
aggregate data in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It does seem to—the labor market does seem, seem to be
pretty stable and broadly in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>When you’ve got a, an unemployment rate that is—that has
been pretty stable now for, for a, a full half a year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>On employment, now, you said there’s a broad range of possibilities, but last
September you said, quote, “We understand that there’s been quite an influx across the borders,
and that has actually been one of things that’s allowed unemployment rate to rise.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Now that the
flow over the border has slowed and we’re seeing deportations, how do you expect the
unemployment rate to react?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 12 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, so what’s happening is that the, the flows across the
border have decreased very significantly, and there’s every reason to expect that to continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so—but job creation has come down a bit, too, so, you know, if those two things come
down together, that, that sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In other
words, a breakeven rate—as, as population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in
new jobs to make—to, to make jobs for, for workers declines as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that seems to be
something about what’s happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You, you do see a very—a very flat unemployment rate at a
time when you’ve seen significant declines [in job growth].</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I want to ask you about Fed employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I know that tax
money is not used here, but Elon Musk alleges that the Fed is, quote, “absurdly overstaffed.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen the Executive Branch push to reduce the federal workforce.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just want to get your
reaction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we run a very careful budget process where we’re
fully aware that what, that, you know, we owe the—we owe that to the public, and we believe we
do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I’ve got no further comment than that, thanks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRIS RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>President Trump has said he
will lower inflation by reducing gas and energy costs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you see such costs as a particular
driver of inflation, and would lowering them have a dramatic effect?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris, I’m not going to—I’m not going to react or discuss anything
that, that any elected politician might say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll give you a mulligan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, oh, thank you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, nearly two weeks ago the Fed said it
was withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System even as, you know, even
Page 13 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
as we have significant wildfires in Los Angeles doing billions of dollars in damage.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of
course, the NGFS, as you know, is a group to talk about how the financial system could address
climate change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many commentators did see the timing as political.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why did you leave that
organization?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you explain that decision?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sure, I’d be glad to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we considered this, you know, really at
length, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, really, the reason is that the, the
work that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Think about nature-related risks and
biodiversity and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, the, the work of the NGFS is, is, in, in significant
part intended to—and this is a quote—“mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition
toward a sustainable economy.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we joined to get the benefit of understanding what other
central banks were doing and, and seeing research and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think this is just way
beyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow
role, as I’ve—as I’ve said many times, and I think that, that the activities of the NGFS are not a
good fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, and I just think it
was time to acknowledge that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the, the process—this process dates back—thinking
about it dates back a couple of years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I made the decision to bring this to the Board, you know,
some months ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just—it just—the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when—
this is when we, we got in and voted on it, so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m aware of how it can look, but it was
really not driven by politics; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the
NGFS and our mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have no, no criticism of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it just isn’t—it’s not right for the Fed.</del></p>

ANDREW ACKERMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m
wondering if you could talk more about what further progress would look like for consumers.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, 2 percent—inflation down to—inflation down to 2 percent
sustainably is what, what we’re trying to achieve.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, we’re, we’re somewhat above that,
as you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that
we’re making further progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And consumers will,
will pick that up, of course, in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>ANDREW ACKERMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you
think you are from neutral.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, you can’t know with any precision, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I like to say,
that you know that—you know the neutral rate by its works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent
we’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee’s estimates of the longer-run
neutral.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s really the question we ask.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you can consult models, empirical models,
theoretical models.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You really have to just look out the window and see how your—how your
policy rate is affecting the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I think we see that it’s having meaningful effects in
bringing inflation under control.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s what we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I would say we’re meaningfully above it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I am—I, I have no illusion
that, that anyone knows precisely how much that is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, but it, you know—not knowing that,
and having cut 100 basis points, means that it’s appropriate that we—that we not be in a hurry to
make further adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 15 of 27

VICTORIA GUIDA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, as a general matter, when it
comes to executive orders and OMB memos, do those always apply to the Fed, sometimes,
never, or do you just often voluntarily comply?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is—what is the legality there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s been—it’s been our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align
our policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—I’m just going
to leave it at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, I’m not going to—I’m not going to go any deeper than that
or, or get into any deeper into this set of issues today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Claire Jones from the Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Two questions, if I may, on
tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, first of all, we’ve seen global trade wars before, notably in 2019 last time around.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But then we were then in a very different place on both inflation and growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we see tariffs of
the same sort of magnitude that we got then—which I know is a big if—what do you think might
be different this time around?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, secondly, Tiff Macklem said there was no doubt that the
threat of tariffs was a big driver of the cut by the Bank of Canada today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What sort of
information would the Fed need to see on tariffs before it was willing to take such a preemptive
move?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, make a—?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To—what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you need to see a strategy, actual implementation, actual movement of inflation
expectations, before you’re actually willing to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of
it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we just—so first of all, thing, things are a little different now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve just come through a high-inflation period, and you can argue that both ways.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You can—
Page 16 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but, but we also
hear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and
so I don’t know how that shakes out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, you’re coming through a situation where
we’re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that’s just different.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, you know, the trade—the kind of footprint of trade is, has changed a, a lot, as
trade is now spread around the, you know—it’s not as concentrated in China as it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There
was a lot more manufacturing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It moved to Mexico and other places.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so there were
differences, and I just think the, the range of possibilities is, is very, very wide.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just don’t
know, and I, I don’t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we didn’t know, by the way, in, I guess, 2018.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, we didn’t really know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it, you
know, the—again, the range of possibilities, very, very wide.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know what’s going to be
tariff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know for how long or how much, what countries.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know about
retaliation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s, that really does remain to be seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, there are lots of places where that—where
that—where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a
consumer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just so many variables.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re just going to have to wait and see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know,
the best we can do is what we’ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at
historical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then
we’ll just have to see—have to see how it—how it goes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Two unrelated
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The first is whether or not there was any discussion about QT and the timeline for
ending QT at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then the second question is just—I wonder if the AI-prompted
Page 17 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
selloff in the stock market this week signaled anything to you about the state of financial
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, on QT, on—let’s, let’s talk about runoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the most recent data
do suggest that reserves are still abundant.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when
runoff began.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And the federal funds rate has been very steady within the target range.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We track
a, a bunch of metrics, and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do intend to
reduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that’s consistent with implementing monetary
policy efficiently and effectively in our ample-reserves regime.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re closely monitoring a, a
range of indicators to assess conditions, and that should provide signals whether reserves are
approaching a level that could be judged as, quote, “somewhat above ample.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I don’t have
anything to say to you about particular dates; it’s just that’s the process, and what we see is, is
that, that rates do appear to be abundant.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to
support the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach
for reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On, on AI, it’s a big event in, in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock
market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, what, what really matters for us is macro developments, and that means
substantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t
put that label on, on these events, although of course we’re all watching it with interest.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist, thank you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
mentioned in your remarks that activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the
same time, since your first rate cut in September, long-term mortgage rates have gone up by a
full percentage point, back above 7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering, kind of looking forward, do you
Page 18 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think—are you confident that activity will remain stable, given how elevated mortgage rates are?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How does it fit into your broader thinking about the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, as you know, as we’ve reduced our, our policy rate 100 basis
points, longer rates have gone up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not because of expectations—not principally because of
expectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and, you
know, it’s long rates that matter for, for housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I don’t think—I think these higher rates
are going to—they’re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent, if they’re
persistent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll have to see how long they persist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we, we are—we control an
overnight rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Generally, it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including
interest rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in this particular case, it’s all happened at a time when, for reasons unrelated
to our policy, longer rates have moved up.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You said you want to see further progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Given that households
appear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should
wait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, I wouldn’t say that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we’ve never said we need to be all the
way at target to reduce rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>At, at any time, what we’re doing is we’re looking at the economy
and asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price
stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think if—we would want to see further progress, but we think our—we think
our—as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Meaningfully restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not
highly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I would think we need to see further
Page 19 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although
we’d love to see that, of course, and we will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And a separate question for you, on tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Curious
whether the threat of tariffs and not knowing whether they could stick or not creates uncertainty
for business here in the United States and could cause them to pull back, ultimately weighing on
growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does the threat of tariffs cause you to ponder your growth forecast?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we—I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the
conduct of tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s not our job, and it’s not our job to comment on the moves that
people make.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I wouldn’t want to criticize anything that’s happening or really comment on
it one way or another—praise it, for that matter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just not our job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do think that—you know, we found in, in 2018, [when] there was a lot of work done on
trade policy uncertainty, trade policy uncertainty, if it’s large and persistent, can start to matter
for businesses making investment decisions and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not something I’m
observing today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very early days for this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that did—I think that did matter in 2018–19.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and it’s one, you know, one of many things we’ll be watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matt Egan from CNN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Following up on
Courtenay’s question from earlier about the stock market, how concerned are you, if at all, about
potential asset bubble brewing in financial markets?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do relatively high market valuations
factor into considerations about potentially lowering interest rates further?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that something
that’s in the back of your mind?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we look—we look at, from a financial stability perspective, at
asset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the
Page 20 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
banking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s just one of the four things,
asset prices are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, yeah, I, I’d say they’re elevated by, by many metrics right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A good
part of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we, we look at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know,
we also—we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are
to those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective, and we think
that there’s a lot of resilience out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Banks have high capital, and households are actually,
overall—not all households, but in, in the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape
financially these days.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how we think about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, you know, we, we also—we look at
overall financial conditions, and you’ve got—you can’t just take—you can’t just take equity
prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got to look at rates, too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in
conditions, with higher rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, overall, financial conditions are probably still somewhat
accommodative, but it’s a mixed bag.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Richard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>RICHARD ESCOBEDO.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m Richard Escobedo with CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One question for you.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>This month’s statement notes that unemployment has stabilized at a low
rate and that the labor market is solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You walked through some of what’s driving this, but I
wonder what risks you see that might challenge your assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, the things we watch, we discussed earlier.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One, one is, is that
there’s a low hiring rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so that if, if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were
to start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the
hiring rate is quite low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that’s one thing we look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s also—it’s worth pointing out that for lower-income households, they are—
they’re under significant pressure.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And in the aggregate, the numbers are good, but we know
Page 21 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that people at the lower end of the income spectrum are, are struggling with, with costs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
really, it’s, it’s high inflation for the basics of life.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s not so much the inflation now; it’s the
price level, because inflation has raised prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation is now closer—much closer to target,
but people are really feeling that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, overall, this is a good labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Here
you’re at 4.1 percent unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s just a really good level, and you’ve been
solidly there now for six, seven months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold
the unemployment rate there, given, given that, you know, there’ll be much slower population
growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One more question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some of the uncertainty around
immigration policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is—in your assessment, is that making it harder for businesses and the Fed
to plan going forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we hear anecdotal reports, but I, I don’t see—there’s
nothing in the data yet on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you do—you hear—you hear that kind of thing about
construction, for example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant
labor are, are saying that it’s, it’s suddenly gotten harder to, to get people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I, again—I
know—you don’t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I’m wondering, are there any periods from your
career, or as it relates to markets, the economy, what’s going on here in Washington and beyond,
or from lessons from history, that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in
uncertain times like today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess I’d say this: Uncertainty is, is with us all the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it is
human nature, apparently, to underestimate the—how fat the tails are, in a way, that, you know,
the, the possibility—we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it’s not a
normal distribution.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your
expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s never not that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t—you know, if you—if you think about it—
think about the first few months of the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are we going to be able
to reopen the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If so, when?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much of it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How long will it take?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, that
was uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we have now is a good labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have the economy growing at,
you know, 2 to 2½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation’s come down to, to now the, you know—the headline
inflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that’s what the public experiences.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at—we look
at core because it’s a better indicator of future inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, yes, the price level went up a lot for
inflation, and people are feeling that, and, and they’re not wrong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I—so the kind of
uncertainty we have is just a, a usual level of uncertainty about the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But then
policies—which are, you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise, really—those are—those are
policies which people are, have been elected to implement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re implementing them with a
view to, to making a better economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I, I don’t think—I wouldn’t call this out as, as a—
as one of those times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t compare it to the Global Financial Crisis or anything like that,
given that we have actually a very good economy right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>EVAN RYSER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Evan Ryser with Market News International.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, is a March
cut still on the table?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And then, additionally, are you looking to see better-than-expected data on
inflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 23 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, as, as I mentioned, the economy’s strong, the labor market’s
solid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation
continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That tells me and the other members of the
Committee—the broad sense of the Committee, actually, is that we don’t need to be in a hurry to
adjust our policy stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your second question was?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Whether or not you need to see better-than-expected inflation data or
just inflation data that roughly aligns with your current forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s one of those things we’ll know it when we see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But
more, more the—the expectation is that we will make continued progress, and, you know, that’s
what we want.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we’ll know it when we see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When we—it, it’s going to have to be
something that isn’t just idiosyncratic.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re going to want to see, you know, continued
progress with housing services inflation; you’re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way
that builds confidence that we are really making progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what it’s going to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, I
mean, is, is that better than our expectations?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we expect to see that, it’s just a question of
when.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SCOTT HORSLEY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott Horsley from NPR.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In your five-year
review, you said the, the 2 percent inflation target won’t be on the table.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you talk a little
about why?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that because you think that’s the right target, or is it because you don’t want to
move the goalpost midgame, or what’s, what’s behind that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think to—I think that goal has served us well over a long period of
time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also the sort of global standard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at
changing that, you wouldn’t do it at a time when you’re not meeting it anyway.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would not look
Page 24 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at changing it anyway, but I certainly wouldn’t look at, at it at a time when you’re not—when
you’re not meeting it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, there’s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if I’m being at all
unclear.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re not—we’re not going to change the inflation goal any time soon.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and five years ago, if I can paraphrase what you all decided, it
was you’re going to not raise interest rates preemptively to, to head off inflation until you see
sort of the whites of the eyes of inflation, because the solid labor market was so beneficial.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Have
the last few years changed your thinking about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So what we really said was that we wouldn’t—we wouldn’t look at
a—at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So the
thought was that we’d seen really low levels of inflation—sorry, of unemployment—with no
sign of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So why would you preemptively want to—want to put people out of work in
the absence of, of any kind of—any evidence that suggested that, that this was not a sustainable
level?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was a way of, of acknowledging how much humility we have about, about the starred
variables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, that was a—that, that was an
insight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll, we’ll discuss that again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’ll be one of the many things that we discuss.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I
don’t think that insight is wrong.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We didn’t—you know, we, we—what we said was that, you
know, in—at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we, we would likely allow
inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was—
turned out not to be relevant to what actually happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There was nothing moderate about the
overshoot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was—it was an exogenous event.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was the pandemic, and it happened, and, you
know, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that
that’s what we should do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to—we, we
looked at the inflation as, as transitory, and—right up to the point where the data turned against

that, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our, our view, and we raised
rates a lot, and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the
framework was, was more irrelevant than anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The, the, that part of it—that part of it
was irrelevant.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The rest of the framework worked just fine as, as we used it, as it supported what
we did to bring inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go to Mark for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MARK HAMRICK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hello, Chairman Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you
know, in the annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, among the risks
outlined is cryptocurrency.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you talk about those risks now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And regarding individuals
and households, perhaps distinct from the concern about the financial system, do you worry that
speculation in this unregulated asset class could hurt their financial well-being, or do you think it
has a place in a household’s portfolio?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, so our, our role with Bitcoin, really, is to look at—with
crypto, really, is to look at the banks, and, and, you know, we, we think it’s—you know, banks
are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks
and its safe, safe and soundness.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many of our—a good number of our banks that we regulate and
supervise do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto
activities, and that’s because they’re so new, and, you know, we don’t want to make the mistake
you’re—if you—if you’re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside
the federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it’s a safe
and sound activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we’re, we’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t
want to, to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, to terminate customers who are

perfectly legal just because of, of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and
supervision, so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And with respect to households and their inclusion in that asset
class?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, you know, that’s, that’s kind of a—it’s not really our, our
bailiwick.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they
have, and that’s why we have, you know, the securities law, laws that we have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s why, you
know, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want
households to have the chance to understand the risk that they’re taking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I, I do
think it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think
that, that’s something Congress was working on quite a lot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve actually spent a lot of time,
you know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on various things, and I, I
think that would be a very constructive thing for, for Congress to do.</del></p>
