Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 3, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment
briefly on recent developments in the banking sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Conditions in that sector have broadly
improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will
continue to monitor conditions in the sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are committed to learning the right lessons
from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As a first
step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the
Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The review’s findings
underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and
more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>My
colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly
committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Since early last
year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are
also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent
approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will

have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be
modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Activity in the housing sector
remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Higher interest rates and
slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market remains very tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the first three months of the year, job gains
averaged 345,000 jobs per month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at
3.5 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming back into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent
months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has sown—
shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But overall, labor
demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the 12 months
ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle
of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting
inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term
inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re continuing to [carry
out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more
than a year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It will take time,
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to
our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the strains that emerged in the banking
sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The extent of these effects remains uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have
put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In determining the
extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over
time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags
with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial
developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of
Page 3 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we
are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a
suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I also
wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March
minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they’re envisioning would look and feel like when
it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A, a decision on a pause was not made today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You will
have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the
Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That sentence is,
is not in, in the statement anymore.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in
Page 4 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation
to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we—that’s a—
that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’ll be
driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’ll approach that question at
the June meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not
my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a
modest rate this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different
forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The] staff produces its
own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the
Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think this is a healthy thing—
that the, the staff is writing down what they really think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not especially influenced by
what the Governors think, and vice versa.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Governors are not taking what the staff says and
just writing that down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can
have different perspectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I
would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical
in modern-era recessions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rachel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible
effects of a debt-limit standoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do
you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what type of situation
would that look like?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:
These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the
Administration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they’re really
consigned to them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling
be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A failure to do that would be unprecedented.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the
consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite
a[d]verse.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll just leave it there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we don’t give advice to either side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We just would
point out that it—that it’s very important that this be done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the, the other point I’ll make
about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the
potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we—
it’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place
where we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not
paying its bills.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just a follow-up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was discussion around the uncertainty of a
possible standoff—did that affect today’s monetary policy decision at all?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say that it did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was—of course, it’s something that
came up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A
number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say that it was important in
today’s monetary policy decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation
Page 6 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest
rate risks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ve done in the wake of the recent
bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And kind of part 3, but it’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation
principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very
well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I did remember it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
what it was was a general presentation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was an informational briefing of the whole Board—
the entire Board.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think all members were there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it was about interest rate risk in the banks
and, and lots of data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you
know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There
was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it was—I
think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry,
horizontal assessment of, of banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming
situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I
thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many
banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the
events of, of early March, to build liquidity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you asked about the separation principle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—
you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the
financial stability tools are not in conflict.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re both—they’re working well together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve
used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, at the
Page 7 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
same time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment
and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, I’m sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t mean to be argumentative, but
the, the staff report said, “SVB . . .</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>has significant interest rate risk.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It said, “Interest rate risk
measurement[s] . . .</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>failed” at SVB.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it said, “Banks with large unrealized losses face
significant safety and soundness risks.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why was that not alarming?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was—they’re
pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you
know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They mentioned
that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters
requiring attention.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that was also in the presentation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it was to say: Yes, this is
a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the
case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Victoria.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask—obviously, with the recent
bank turmoil, we’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was just curious whether you
think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial
stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even
larger.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to
further consolidate banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking
industry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now there
Page 8 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
are 4,000 and change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s going on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I personally have long felt that having small-,
medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the
community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important
purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s healthy to have a, you
know, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that’s a
positive thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First
Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you know,
there’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it was legitimate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think the
FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would assume
that’s what they did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So do you have any concerns about the fact that they’re, they’re
getting larger in general?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the
largest banks doing big acquisitions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is the policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but this is—this is an exception
for a failing bank.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It also
would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the
regional banks bought, bought this company.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that could have been the outcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But,
ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost
bid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now to Colby.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the March
meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be
Page 9 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
equal to one or more rate increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, given developments since then, how has your estimate
changed?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite
impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, in principle, that’s the
idea.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit,
and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of
broadly similar way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one
and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, ultimately, we
have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But I
think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have
to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The extent of that is so
hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t
know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s, that’s what
we’ll be watching carefully to find out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the
Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains
strong then, if, if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as
we want to find ourselves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent
to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by
meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in
Page 10 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the statement, the obvious factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s really all we can do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad
understanding of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Credit tightening is a different thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a lot of
literature on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even
further uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions—
what’s happening with lending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We get—there’s a lot of data on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’ll,
we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, noting that
the statement dropped the reference to “sufficiently” restricted—“restrictive,” I was wondering,
given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact,
sufficiently restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to need data
to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think
we’ve reached that point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March
meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was—
this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to—
before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you
know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I have a follow-up on credit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you give us a sense of
what the SLOOS survey indicated?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were
Page 11 of 25

tightening credit as of the, the last survey.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What did this one show, and how did that weigh into
your deliberations?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line
with our usual time frame.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you
see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing
from other sources.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls
that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really
since the second half of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Nick.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, the argument
around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was
to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>After the bank failures in March, as
you’ve discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So my question is
why it was necessary to raise interest rates today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of
slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ve, for the last two
meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to
keep moving?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy
we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of
policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over
time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think slowing
down was the right move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do
Page 12 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We always have to balance
the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of
maybe slowing down economic activity too much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we thought that this rate hike, along
with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to
Howard’s question—you’ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently
restrictive stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period
than a six-week intermeeting cycle?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment
will be an ongoing one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you
can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look, look back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve seen inflation
come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve seen inflation have
a few months of coming down and then come right back up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think you’re going to want to
see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve
got this right, kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis
points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that policy is tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them
many different ways.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable
estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’ve got 2 percent
real rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would,
would assess as, you know, the neutral rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So policy is tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you see that in interest—
interest-sensitive activities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s

ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly
even at—that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you very much, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence with
Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections
show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of
3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our
target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a
question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, ultimately,
we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have a, a goal of getting to
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think it’s going to take some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How does the other side of the mandate—the jobs side—once
you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at
that point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You still got
1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, overall, you’re near a
50-year low in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late
Page 14 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last week, and it’s—whenever it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points
above what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we do
see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These are very positive developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well
above our—well above our goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation
down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MATTHEW BOESLER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed
officials’ projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast
as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I’m just wondering if you
could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’re optimistic that a recession can be avoided,
given that that’s the Fed staff’s forecast—possibly also the broader Committee’s forecast as
well—and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters’.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the
Summary of Economic Projections and all that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you
said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first-
quarter GDP at that point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Anyway,
in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s
interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the
unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was
when we started.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So job openings are still very, very high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see—by surveys and much,
Page 15 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
much [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s—it really is
different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of
the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, that’s what we’ve seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
we—there are no promises in this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can
continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment
that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, that would be against history.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I
fully appreciate that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That would be against the, the pattern.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But I do think that it—that this, that
the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are
actually—wages have been moving down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a
good sign—down to a more sustainable level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that—I think it’s still possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—you
know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely
than that of having, having a recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession
is—I don’t rule that out, either.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild
recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still
well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you see that as well?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at a range of wage, wage measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then
that’s in nominal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases
plus inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation
index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically,
those four and many others.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have
to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They can
Page 16 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deviate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, corporate margins can go up and down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there is a feature of long
expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a
recession—sorry, later in an expansion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, yeah.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The, the—you know, and we calculate those,
and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would say that what
they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer
to where they need to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take
to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—by the way, I don’t want
to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re asking me a very
specific question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there are many things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I think wages and prices tend to move together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know,
that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you mentioned
profit margins.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And
while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’t
fallen as much as might be expected, given that we’re seeing at least some pullback among
consumer spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a
driver of higher prices?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to
reduced inflation in the coming months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you
have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or,
or not flexible enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we
Page 17 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation
come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of
full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then it’s—then it’s, then
you’re really back to full competition.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you
tell us something about what your policy reaction function is—your policy framework is going
forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data,
which is, by definition, backward looking?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you going to be forecasting what you think is
going to happen?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I didn’t catch the last part.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rolling?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you
rule that out?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Oh, yes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, I got it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, what are we looking
at?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, the whole idea is
to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re always, always
looking at both.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’ll be readings
on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of
those many things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks
now and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are small and
medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on
lending?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’ll, that’ll be an important thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—
Page 18 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are shrinking the
balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but
perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we have to factor all of that in and, and
make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is
challenging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What about the idea of rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is
going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And in that world, if that forecast
is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If you
have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in,
you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s not
our forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation
moves down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved
much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s quite stable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to
weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to
begin to see progress there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate
for us to cut rates.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m curious how you view the
role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you
think it’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to
Page 19 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
compete with banks for deposits?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of
the facility?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It hasn’t actually
been growing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have
really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits
and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home
Loan Banks and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had
been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits
into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What
was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and
spreading them around and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect
overall on the overnight repo facility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re
supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.</strong></em></p>

speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the
markets, and borrowing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be—
we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just—it just
Page 20 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
shouldn’t be a thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the
Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally
from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Scott.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>SCOTT HORSLEY.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Scott Horsley for NPR.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In his report last
week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the
regulatory—or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt
all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift
towards less aggressive oversight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You were here in 2019.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you share that view, and what
would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be
necessary?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the
work, but I do—I have read it, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I find it persuasive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I would say it this
way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly
and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think
the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened,
and, and identify what we need to do to address that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some of that is—may, it may just have
been technology evolving.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we have to keep up with all that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But some of it may be
our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What our job is now is, identify those
things and implement them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I
feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Evan.</strong></em></p>

EVAN RYSER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Evan Ryser with MNI Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, are we
in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that what the statement is saying?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There were
three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we—
that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those have now all been resolved, and
all the depositors have been protected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic
kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that
period of, of severe stress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with
credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and
you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized
banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s going
to be the macroeconomic effect of that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully
monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our
decisions in an important way, going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Fed Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just
wondered if you’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up
to it over the last—since you’ve been Fed Chairman, I think I’ve heard you say a couple of times
that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you think that was the right way to go
about this?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, yeah, comments on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for
five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ve learned some
Page 22 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
new things as well, and we need to do better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was
unflinching and appropriately so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I welcome it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I agree with and will support those
recommendations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster
measures that will address the problems.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know,
the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Vice Chair, it says, shall
deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding
supervision and regulation of depository institution . . .</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>companies . . . ,</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>and shall oversee the
supervision and regulation of such firms.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for
someone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets
to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Congress wanted
that person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the way it
works—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I give
my, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I have good conversations,
and I try to contribute constructively.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that
person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think
that’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I believe that’s what the law
requires.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an
intelligent discussion about what’s going on and why.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, that’s, that’s my input.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of
Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just wondered if you have any regrets?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or was there anything that, you
know—decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what’s happened?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 23 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve had a few, sure.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, you know, who doesn’t look back and
think that you could have done things differently?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As one of my great mentors used to
always say, “Control the controllable.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn
the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and I think that, that
Vice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MEGAN CASSELLA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Did the possibility of
pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m curious if
you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again
or what those discussions entailed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across
the board.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the
minutes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But people did talk about pausing,
but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re,
we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you
know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various
channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and we’re going to be looking at
those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the
statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report
or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 24 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just think
we’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think we can
afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ve learned from the banking
crisis—that you would learn the right lessons.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What are those lessons?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which
is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through
history.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in
supervision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought
that was possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite
so quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that, you know, that will play through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I, you know—it will be up to
Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think—I think
that’s one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I guess I would just say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then, you know—that we’re going to—
obviously, we’re going to revisit [this].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that
we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m, I’m
thinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you be any more specific on stress testing or
looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s—see, that’s, that’s what Vice Chair Barr’s role really
is, and he’ll take the lead on that.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 22, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly
address recent developments in the banking sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at
a small number of banks have emerged.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>History has shown that isolated banking problems, if
left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the
banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of
households and businesses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve,
working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S.
economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These actions demonstrate
that all depositors’ savings and the banking system are safe.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With the support of the Treasury,
the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that
hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This
program, along with our long-standing discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual
funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is
available.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will
continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our
tools as needed to keep it safe and sound.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons
from this episode and to work to prevent episodes—events like this from happening again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy: Inflation remains too high, and
the labor market continues to be very tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>My colleagues and I understand the hardship that
high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to
our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Without price
Page 1 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability, the economy does not work for anyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In particular, without price stability, we will
not achieve a sustained period of long—of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some
of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed
investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As shown in our
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4
percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run
normal growth rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the
downside.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Yet the labor market remains extremely tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job gains have picked up in recent months,
with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor force participation
rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>However,
with job vacancies still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available
workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come
into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median
unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and
4.6 percent at the end of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 2 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the 12 months
ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Core PCE—excluding those, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In February, the
12-month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was
5.5 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of
these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median
projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year,
and 2.1 percent in 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way
to go and is likely to be bumpy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as
well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¾ to 5 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we are continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger
than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We believe,
Page 3 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter
credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary
policy should respond.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate
increases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional
policy firming may be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess
the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor
market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds
rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.3 percent at the end of 2024, and
3.1 percent at the end of 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These are little changed from our December projections,
reflecting offsetting factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our meeting—
decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the vincoming data and their implications
for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 4 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses
across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the Fed will do
everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How confident is
the Committee that the recent stress that we’ve seen, and you’ve alluded to, is contained at this
point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound
and it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We took powerful actions with [the]
Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the
banking system is safe.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal
review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, just a quick follow-up: I mean, given all the stress and the
uncertainty that you’ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a—was a pause
considered for this meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the
meeting, and you see the decision that we made, which I’ll say a couple things about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First, it
was supported by a very strong consensus, and I’ll be happy to explain why.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, really, it is
that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and,
really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the
Page 5 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December—at the time of the
December meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We are committed to restoring price stability, and all of the evidence says
that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result
in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on
demand, on the labor market, and on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Such a tightening in financial conditions would
work in the same direction as rate tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In principle, as a matter of fact, you can think of it
as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that; of course, it’s not possible to
make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So our decision was to move ahead
with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to
some, some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So going
forward, as I mentioned, in assessing the need for, for further hikes, we’ll be focused as always
on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular, on our assessment of the actual
and expected effects of credit tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate
increases and firming?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without
you increasing rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Really, I would
focus on, on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Ongoing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we
clearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the
uncertainty about what will happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very
Page 6 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
modest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy,
in which case inflation will continue to be strong—in which case, you know, the path will look—
might look different.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant
tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary
policy may have less work to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We simply don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you have concerns that the recent—that the hike you did today
could further exacerbate the problem in the banks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused
on macroeconomic outcomes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening
and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think when we think about
the situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular
our lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, in your
testimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Obviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I realize there’s a lot of
uncertainty, but can you—can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your
colleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit
availability because of the stress in the banking sector, or are you waiting to see it in the data
before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we have just come from an FOMC meeting and, you
know, the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I’ll tell you what I
heard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would
Page 7 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
be some, some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as, as
our policies do, and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did
turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So some people did
reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there may also just have been—
remember, this is 12 days ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent
and it’s people—you know, it’s very difficult, there’s so much uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So December was a
good place to start, and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for
December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of
the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that pointed
to higher rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then this, this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions
tightening really, really offset that, effectively.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To follow up: Have you considered at all whether your primary tool,
the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you
believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Have you, for
example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the System Open
Market Account, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don’t accelerate
deposit erosion, for example, from banks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no,
we think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate
hikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Victoria.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Victoria Guida with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask—you, along
with the FDIC and the Treasury—the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to
Page 8 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was just wondering if you could
speak to why that decision was made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern
that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of
these banks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the
risk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That was the
issue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, and then can you also—just to follow up, can you speak to
the role that you will be playing in the Fed’s internal investigation on its supervision and
regulation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And he’s
responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—I realized, you know, right
away that, that there was going to be a need for review.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the question we’re all asking
ourselves over that first weekend was, how did this happen?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so what we did was, early
Monday morning, we sat down and said, “Let’s do this.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And he, he was obviously going to lead
it in his capacity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t—my role was to announce it, and I get briefed on it, but I’m not
involved in, in the work of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider from Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
want to go back to your February press conference.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned the word “disinflation,” I
believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully
under way, or something like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 9 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the
question 12 times, so it’s—maybe it’s a feature, not a bug.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, so, but yeah, absolutely the
same—the story is intact, so it’s really three parts, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Goods inflation has been coming down
now for six months; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it’s certainly
proceeding.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Housing services is, is really a matter of time passing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We continue to see the new
leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s 44 percent of the—of the core
PCE index, where you’ve got a story that’s ongoing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where we didn’t have in February, and we
still don’t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that is, you
know, that’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some
softening in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t see that yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s of course
56 percent of the index.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the story is pretty much the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I will say that the inflation data
that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don’t see
more coming from the credit crunch, because it seems to me that’s something that you’d actually
welcome to a degree and expect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And are you not seeing more coming from that because you
don’t know, or because you just don’t want to have another round of wishful thinking?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a
great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Very large body of literature.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question is, how significant will this
credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s the issue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t really
see it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s
very kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we think it’s, it’s potentially
Page 10 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite real and that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we think about further
rate hikes for us, we’ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder if you could talk a little bit—I know that you’ve
got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think
happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about
regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wonder, you know,
how can the American people have confidence that there aren’t other weaknesses out there in the
banking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say what, what I think happened, and then I’ll come to the
questions around supervision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed
badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and
interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and
intervened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that the public saw all this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that SVB experienced an
unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is a—this is a very large group of
connected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster
than historical record would suggest.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of
supervision and regulation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How did
this happen is the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What went wrong?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Try to find that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will find that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then
make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again,
and then implement those policies.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my
views on what the answers might be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I simply can’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Vice Chair Barr is
Page 11 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
leading this, and I think he’s testifying next week.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but that will be up to him.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s
really where it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is
clear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and
regulation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I, I
plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And the final point—you know, can we feel confident that these
weaknesses don’t exist elsewhere, given that they got missed at this bank?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through
the banking system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its
percentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And again,
supervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were—
they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s really the nature
of the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve
been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them
there for quite some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Following today’s decision, the markets have now priced in one more
increase in May, and then every meeting the rest of this year they’re pricing in rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are
they getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you’re
looking at it, given that you’re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to
ongoing?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows
that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and
Page 12 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market, with inflation moving down gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In that most likely case, if
that happens, participants don’t see rate cuts this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They just don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would just say: As
always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens
rather than what we write down in the SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s not our baseline expectation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the
rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is
based on being—it will be sufficiently restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or is it leavened by the idea of you don’t
know what&#39;s going to happen?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In other words, what should people think about in terms of how
the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s going to depend.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of
our monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is
there going to be some tightening in credit conditions?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then we’re thinking about that as
effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes: It can come from, you know,
from tighter credit conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re looking at, and we, we—it’s highly uncertain how long
the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be, so we’re just
going to have to watch.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In the meantime, you know—obviously, at the end of the day, we will
do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one should doubt that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Rachel Siegel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank
you for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I know we’ve talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was
unique to a certain sector of the economy, but there’s also growing concern that there are
Page 13 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll
over later this year and next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those
loans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of—what we saw with SVB to banks that
disproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in
commercial real estate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I really don’t think it’s comparable to this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The, the banking system is,
is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it’s well capitalized, and I really don’t see that as at all
analogous to this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And one other question: Would you be open to an independent
investigation, separate from the Fed’s probe?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I welcome—it’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent
investigations and outside investigations and all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we welcome—when a bank fails, there
are investigations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, we welcome that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has been rather sticky, so do you need help from the fiscal side to get
inflation down faster?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t assume that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t give advice to the fiscal authorities,
and we assume that—we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model
along with a million other things.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We have responsibility for price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Federal
Reserve has responsibility for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And nothing’s going to change that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So—and we will get
inflation down to 2 percent in time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 14 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if I can follow on that, but they’re working—the
spending that’s happened is working against what you are doing, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s prolonging
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You have to look at, at the impulse from spending because spending
was, of course, tremendously high during the pandemic, and then, as the pandemic programs
rolled off, spending actually came down, so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s
driving inflation right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving
inflation, but that’s not really the story now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Neil Irwin.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin with Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Two questions about aspects of
the government’s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First, why is this new
bank funding facility done under emergency 13(3) authority, as opposed to expansion of the
discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that’s been around a long time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, second, can you discuss the Fed’s role in the—in the FDIC guarantee of uninsured
depositors and why there’s $143 billion on your balance sheets last week, supporting that deposit
guarantee?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So 13(3) seemed like the right—we have a little more
flexibility under section 13(3).</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
needed to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 13(3).</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Really
no magic to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s only available in unusual and exigent circumstances, and it has to be—
meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So with the FDIC, we’re just,
we’re lending to the, in effect, we’re—we’re lending to the bridge bank.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s where the
Page 15 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
funds came from, and it’s—it’s a loan that’s 100 percent guaranteed by the FDIC, so there’s no
risk in it for us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, Chris Rugaber.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The SEB—SEP
suggests one more rate hike, as does the change in the language in the statement and which
suggests that you’re perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do you feel, though, that if
inflation remains high, you’ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed, or have you
somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank
you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, absolutely not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, we, if we need to raise hike—raise rates
higher, we will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think for now though we, we—as I’ve mentioned, we see the likelihood of, of
credit tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We know that can have, you know, an effect on the macroeconomy, on
demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that
is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
we’ll be watching all those things, and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight
enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll find ourselves at that place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KYLE CAMPBELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Chair Powell—thanks for taking the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kyle Campbell
with American Banker.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First of all, I’m
curious at what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount
window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing
the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m also curious what your thoughts are on the—not just the availability
Page 16 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you
might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear
about how I’m thinking about these recent developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the recent liquidity provision that
has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different
from what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term
securities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance
of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which
supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The balance sheet expansion is
really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent
tensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do believe that it’s
working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and
thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in
financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the distribution of reserves, we, we don’t see ourselves as, as running into
reserve shortages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to, to run off
predictably, predicatbly and passively is working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And of course we’re, we’re always prepared
to, to change that if that changes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CATARINA SARAIVA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Chair.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
minutes of the January–February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the
possibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on
bank portfolios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion—kind of what was talked
Page 17 of 23

about in light of that, and then why didn’t the Fed, you know, do anything about that at that point
to ultimately prevent, you know, what happened this month?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
been quite an interesting seven weeks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have
been presentations about, about interest rate risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not
a surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long-
duration securities that have lost value as, as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate
increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s not a surprise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think, as you know, as is now in the public record,
the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and
was escalating but, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s really the
purpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to
understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we
need to change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that, the speed of the
run, it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it does kind of suggest that there’s a
need for possible, you know, regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and
regulation need to keep up with what’s, what’s happening in the world.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these
escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have to come back to you on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you very
much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors’ savings in the banking system
are safe.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Shouldn’t Congress
Page 18 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have a say in that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1 billion in assets
failed, are you promising to bail out all of its depositors?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I’m not saying anything more than I’m saying.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but what
I’m saying is you’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of
serious harm to the economy or to—or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those
tools.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think depositors should assume that their—that their deposits are safe.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Greg Robb.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was
wondering if you could give us a little bit more color.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You gave just a little bit of color.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend—you said the question you guys asked
was “How did this happen?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>when you saw Silicon Valley Bank.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I was wondering if you
could go to the Credit Suisse merger.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, wasn’t that the big gorilla in the room?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Aren’t—
didn’t you breathe a sigh of relief when that merger happened?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we—that was really the Swiss government that
we of course were, were following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with
their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It seems
to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been—
the markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that
it might not go well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going
well so far.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nicole.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NICOLE GOODKIND.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nicole Goodkind with CNN
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In the Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC sees the unemployment rate
Page 19 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
increasing to 4.5 percent this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from
snowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand
slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The costs of bringing it
down—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent, but the costs of failing are much
higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank
doesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain
anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to
invest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re looking to avoid that and,
you know, to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century, and
get there as quickly as we can.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I guess the question is, historically, it’s hard to—
historically, it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I, I—the question is, do you worry
about some sort of snowball effect, and how do you factor that into your projections and your
thoughts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear,
and so they’re very hard to model.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the models all work in a kind of linear way—if
you have more of this, you get more of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to
be nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We don’t
know—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on
getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most
benefit the people we serve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong
Page 20 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
labor markets through these long expansions that we’ve had.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Four of the five longest, or three of
the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high-inflation period.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or,
you know, an expansion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and
we had several of those, and they’re very good for people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see late in an expansion—you
see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the
wage spectrum.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Young with Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just wanted to ask,
with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibility of a soft landing for the
U.S. economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know it’s, it’s too early to say, really, whether these events have
had much of an effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I
guess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
know, the question will be how long this period is sustained.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The longer it’s sustained, then the
greater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so
we’ll just have to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
that pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just wondering: How many financial institutions have been issued matters
requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 21 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How many?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But those are serious—those are serious
regulatory, in particular immediate attention, and that’s—and I guess there were six of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and getting to the seriousness of it, how are you
going to ensure that banks comply with these citations, take them seriously—how will you
enforce them?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review
will be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what
you think about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What can we do to make sure that—but, again, that’s not for me to answer
today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you have specific thoughts on that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well I, I—see, if I did, I wouldn’t share them because I, I really, you
know, this review is going on, and, you know, I want nothing other than us to find out what
happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s all I want.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed, or partially informed, thoughts,
it, you know, just isn’t appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a real serious review going on with, with people
from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this, you know, to this work,
not connected to this bank, and under, again, Vice Chair Barr’s leadership, and I’m confident
that it will produce a satisfactory result.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, we’ll go to Jennifer for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Curious—how do you view financial conditions right now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If credit becomes
expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’re watching for, would that situation
warrant a rate cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What situation would warrant a rate cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And have the bank failures
Page 22 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we haven’t really talked about changing the balance sheet
implementation—that’s not something we’ve discussed yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, we’re always
willing to change that if we conclude that it’s appropriate, but we’re really not seeing any signs
there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a—
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Curious how you view financial conditions now and, if
credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by
more than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest]
rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we think
that, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there are other measures which, if they’re focused on, you know—bank lending
conditions and things like that—they show some more tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question for us, though,
is, how significant will that be and how, you know—what will be the extent of it and what will
be the duration of it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then—and then, you know, once you have—once you know that,
there’s a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands—how that works
its way into the economy [and] over what period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, you know, we’ll be looking to
see the first part of that—like how serious is this, and does it look like it’s going to be sustained,
and if it is, you know, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would
factor that into our policy decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mentioned with rate cuts, rate cuts are not in our base
case, and, you know, so that’s all I have to say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you very much.</del></p>
