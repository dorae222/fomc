Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 18, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us
well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more
to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports
ahead of potential tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Private
domestic final purchases, or PDFP, as we call them—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Within PDFP, growth
of consumer spending moderated, while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded
from weakness in the fourth quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a
decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook,
largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It remains to be seen how these developments might
affect future spending and investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median
participant projects GDP to rise 1.4 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year—somewhat
slower than projected in March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged
135,000 per month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wage growth has continued to moderate
while still outpacing inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median projection for the
unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and next, a bit higher than
projected in March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index
and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May
and that—excluding the volatile food and energy categories—core PCE prices rose
2.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as
reflected in both market- and survey-based measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Respondents to surveys of consumers,
businesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Beyond the next
year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our
2 percent inflation goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation this year is—is
3 percent, somewhat higher than projected in March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median inflation projection falls to
2.4 percent in 2026 and 2.1 percent in 2027.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to determine the appropriate
Page 2 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies continue to evolve, and
their effects on the economy remain uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The effects of tariffs will depend, among other
things, on their ultimate level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic
effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Even so, increases in tariffs this year
are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time shift in the price
level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Avoiding
that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass
through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As we act to
meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of
the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median projection projects—participant—median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this
year, the same as projected in March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median projection declines to 3.6 percent at the end of
next year and to 3.4 percent at the end of 2027, a little higher than the March projection.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These
individual forecasts are always subject to uncertainty, and, as I have noted, uncertainty is
unusually elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We focused on issues related to assessing the risks and
uncertainties that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implications for policy
strategy and communications.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference that
we held last month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board
lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We intend to wrap up any
modifications to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy by late
summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>After that, we will consider enhancements to our suite of communications tools,
including the SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in
Page 4 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>To what extent
has the more limited impact from tariffs at this stage on inflation changed your view on what the
ultimate economic fallout will be from these policies and the timing of when they will
materialize in the data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ve had three months of, of favorable inflation readings since
the high readings of January and February, and that’s, of course, highly welcome news.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Part of
that just is that services, core services—both housing services and nonhousing services have
really been grinding down toward levels that are—that are consistent with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s the good news.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course, we
expect—as you—as you point out, we, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the
summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the
end consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A good example of that would be, goods being sold at retailers today may have been
imported several months ago—before tariffs were imposed—so we’re beginning to see some
effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we do expect to see more of them over coming months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We do—we do also see
price increases in some of the relevant categories like personal computers and audio-visual
equipment—things like that that are attributable to tariff increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, we look at
surveys of businesses, and there, there are many of those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you, you do see a range of
things, but, but many, many companies do expect to—to, to put all or—some or all of the effect
Page 5 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of tariffs through to the next, next person in the—in the chain and, ultimately, to the consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today—you know, the amount of these—the, the amount of the tariff effects, the size of the
tariff effects, their duration, and the time it will take are all highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that is why
we think the appropriate thing to do is to hold where we are as we learn more, and we think our
policy stance is, is in a good place—where we’re well positioned to react to incoming
developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So in terms of how we should interpret the rate cuts penciled into the
SEP, is this reflecting that there’s this expectation that underlying inflation will just stay well
enough contained that allows the Committee to eventually move ahead with those cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or is it
about, you know, responding to a deterioration in economic activity, let’s say?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, how
should we make sense of the forecast?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if you look at the forecast, you will see that people do generally
expect inflation to move up and then to come back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we can’t just assume that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Of
course, we don’t know that, and, you know, our, our job is to make sure—one of our jobs—to
make sure that a one-time increase in inflation doesn’t turn into an inflation problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And that,
again—that will depend on the size of the effects, how long it takes for them to come in, and,
and, ultimately, on, on keeping inflation expectations anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, and thanks, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with
Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at the, the rate path starting in December to today and adjust it over the full
time horizon you’ve got there, you’ve taken about ¼ point per year out of your projected path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you end at a higher rate in end-2027 than you were—would have in the prior forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is
that a result of, of a sense that tariffs will lead to more persistent inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it a result of
Page 6 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
reassessments of where your short-term neutral rate is?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it—why, why are you on a slower
path now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would focus most on the—on the nearer term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you think—as
you get out to the—to the later years, it’s hard to—it’s hard for anybody to know where the
economy is going.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You didn’t see people moving their longer-term, you know, estimate of the
neutral rate, for example, at this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and those things are probably slow moving.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
think—I think if you look at what’s happening here since March—this is since March, right?—</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>you see a little slower growth, just a tiny tick up, one-tenth tick up, in, in unemployment, and
you see inflation moving up three-tenths.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And by the way, it was—it was a similar move from
the December SEP to the March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what you see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see the, the effects of tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
think we learned in April, after the March meeting, that substantially higher tariffs were likely,
and then since then, the estimates of where the tariffs will be have actually moved back down,
although still at an elevated level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re adapting in real time, and what you see is, you
know, an, an accumulation of individual assessments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, but you say in the statement that risks have diminished
on that front, but the July 9, you know, drop-dead date for all the, the Liberation Day tariffs is
still out there and unresolved.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got now an exchange of missiles between two Middle
East adversaries, with a possible U.S. involvement—how can you justify saying that risks have
diminished?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what we said was that uncertainty has, has—uncertainty about the
economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many, many surveys say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and, and, that’s—that’s actually a line from the Tealbook, which you can see in five years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember to check that. [</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Laughter]
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No—but if you think of that, tariff uncertainty—uncertainty really
peaked in April and since then has come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—that’s really what that’s just
acknowledging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s diminished but still elevated—that it’s uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that’s an
accurate statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris Rugaber.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There is
an argument out there in favor of cutting rates more immediately.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has continued to cool
and is back at roughly 2 percent, despite the tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I guess I also wanted to ask about, you
know, cracks in the job market, with gross hiring slowing—concentrated in just a few industries.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen some housing data, including this morning, that have been pretty weak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you see
any concerns that, you know, the economy is weakening and that is a reason to cut rates going
forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we do—we do, of course, monitor all those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I think if
you look at the overall picture, you know, what you’re seeing is 4.2 percent unemployment and
an economy that’s growing at a—at a rate hard to know, given the, the unusual flows in the first
quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it appears to be 1½, 2 percent—maybe a little better than that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sentiment has come
up off of its very low levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s still—it’s still depressed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, you can—you can
point to things—the housing market is a longer-run problem and also a short-run problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
don’t think it’s indicative of—you know, basically, the situation is, we have a longer-run
shortage of housing, and we also have high rates right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the best thing we can do for
the housing market is to restore price stability in a sustainable way and, and create a strong labor
market, and that’s the best thing we can do for the housing market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You asked about the job
Page 8 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
market—again, look at labor force participation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look at wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look at job creation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re
all at healthy levels now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I would say you can see perhaps a very, very slow continued
cooling, but nothing that’s troubling at this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we watch it—we watch it very,
very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, overall, again, the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well
positioned to respond in a timely way to economic developments, and—for now—and we’ll be
watching the data carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Well, just quickly on—given that, you know, there are
concerns inflation will rise—but there is the alternate scenario that tariffs would create demand
destruction and slow growth sufficiently and that would perhaps keep a bit of a lid on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Do you see odds of that scenario, what kind of odds do you see of that scenario coming true, and
how many months of cool inflation would you need to see before concluding that maybe that
lower-inflation scenario is taking place?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is very much the conversation we had today and yesterday.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There, there are many, many different scenarios—many combinations of scenarios where
inflation does or doesn’t prove out to be at the levels we think and where the labor market does
or doesn’t soften.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think what, what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of
very high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one holds
these, these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they’re all
going to be data dependent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that—you can make a case for, for any of the rate paths, I
think, that you see in, in the SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we do this once a quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—it’s a hard
thing to do at this—particularly at this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But it does reflect—you know, if you see somebody
writing down, you know, a, a rate path that involves cuts, that’s them saying, “Yes, I think we
will get to a place, more likely than not, where cuts will be appropriate.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it could be—it
Page 9 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
could be a joint probability of a number of possible outcomes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, remember how much
uncertainty we face, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chair, I wonder if you could describe for us some
of those scenarios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you get to a place—I’m noticing that the uncertainty levels in your
forecast are very high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>How do you get to a place where you have the confidence in the outlook
for—say, inflation and/or growth or the unemployment rate—how many months does it take, and
what do you want to see in the data to get to that level of confidence to actually reduce rates off
the restrictive level?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s—it’s—again, it’s very, very hard to say when that will
happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that the time will come; it come—could come quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could not come
quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As long as the economy is solid, though—as long as we’re seeing the kind of labor
market that we have and reasonably decent growth and inflation moving down, we feel like the
right thing to do is to be where we are, with where our policy stance is, and just learn more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
in particular, we feel like we’re going to learn a great deal more over the summer on tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
do—we hadn’t expected them to show up much by now, and they haven’t, and we will see
whether—the extent to which they do over, over coming months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think that’s going to
inform our thinking, for one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, we’ll see how the labor market progresses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
at some point, it will become clear.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can’t tell you exactly when that will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know,
meanwhile, we’ll be watching, watching the labor market very carefully for signs of weakness
and strength and tariffs for signs of, of what’s going to happen there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, there are
many developments ahead, you know, even in the near term—developments are expected on
tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we, we don’t yet know with any confidence where they will settle out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
Page 10 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have an estimate, and it’s a pretty—I think all estimates are now pretty close together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s—
it’s, yeah, highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When you say “estimate”—estimate of the impact of tariffs on the
core PCE—is that what it is?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And can you share that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, what you start with is, is—what’s the effective tariff rate
overall?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And people are managing to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, the, the pass-through of tariffs to
consumer price inflation is a whole process that’s very uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, as you know, there
are many parties in that chain: There’s the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer,
and the consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to, to pay for the
tariff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But together, they will all pay for it together—or maybe one party will pay it all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that
process is very hard to predict, and we haven’t been through a situation like this, and I think we
have to be humble about our ability to forecast it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s why we need to see some actual data
to have—to make better decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we’d like to get some, some more data, and, and, again,
in the meantime, we can do that because the economy remains in solid condition.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, I guess I’m
wondering if you could explain a little more the divergence we see in the dot plot, particularly
around the 2025 rate projections.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I realize this is—you know, you have one group of officials
that are putting down no cuts, another that are putting down more than one—and recognizing
that could be difficult to summarize, but is it a matter of people having a different outlook or a
different reaction function?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>A different commitment to defending against another inflation
mistake?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How, how did that play out over the last two days?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 11 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right, we—and, as is often the case, we have a pretty
healthy diversity of views on the Committee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We did have strong support for today’s decision
and broad agreement that our policy stance does leave us in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would point to
two factors, and you mentioned them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The first is just that parties have a diversity of forecasts,
and, and they do align with, with where—with where their dots are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if you have a higher
inflation forecast, you’re going to be less likely to be writing down, you know, more, more cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But as—remember, as we see more data, we’re going to learn more about where inflation is
headed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that means when it is time to look at, at normal—at sort of, at, you know—
resuming our normalization process, the differences you may—you see should be smaller
because we’ll have seen actual data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right now, it’s just a forecast in a very foggy time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s the first part—is forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Secondly, people can look at the same data, and they can evaluate the risks differently, as
you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that includes, you know, the, the risk of higher inflation, the risk it’ll be more
persistent, the risk that the labor market will weaken—people are going to have different
assessments of that risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you put that in there, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those are the two ways that, that—the
two things, I think, that drive these things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember, though, with—as I mentioned earlier—
with uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with a lot of conviction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s really where it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a function of those things, and I think as the data come in, you
should see those differences diminish.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up—you’ve said the policy is in a good place, and
that it’s modestly restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given all the uncertainty—you just talked about tariff levels,
uncertainty around the pass-through—is it price increases versus margin compression?—some of
Page 12 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the softness that Chris talked about in, in labor and housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why wouldn’t it be better to have
rates at a more neutral setting as the economy heads into this period of very high uncertainty?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you just look backward at the data, that, that’s what you would
say, but that’s not—we have to be forward looking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the thing that every forecaster—every
outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to
arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think a backward-looking
look would, would lead you to a neutral stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we, we can’t—we have to—we have to look
at that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what’s going
to happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It, it’s, you know, the—there’s a range of possibilities on how, how large the, the
inflation effects and the other effects are going to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll make smarter and better decisions
if we just wait a couple of months or however long it takes to get a sense of, of really what, what
is going to be the pass-through of inflation and what’re—what’s going to be the effects on
spending and on hiring and all those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your
friend down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue continues to lob insults in your direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m
wondering, given now that the Supreme Court has maybe carved out the Fed from some of the
legal implications of that, whether this is just noise that the markets and everybody should ignore
until your term is up or whether you worry that it could lead to more pressure on confidence on
Wall Street—on consumers—about the outlook for the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, from my standpoint, it’s—it’s not complicated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What
everyone on the FOMC wants is a good, solid American economy with a strong labor market
and, and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we want.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think our policy is well positioned to—right
Page 13 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now to, to deliver that and, and to be able to respond in a timely way as the data lead us around.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy’s been resilient, and part of that is our stance, and, again, we think we’re—we’re
in a good place on that to respond to significant economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what matters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is what matters to us—pretty much, that’s all that matters to us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I need to ask—assuming you are not reappointed, would you stay
on as Governor when your term as Chair ends?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m—I’m not thinking about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m thinking about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess with workplace raids
increasing, picking up significantly—what kind of effect would that have on the labor market in
the short term?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, sorry—with what picking up?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Workplace raids.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Ah, ah, immigration—so you’re asking immigration?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, you know—I, I wouldn’t want to speculate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What—one way
to get at that from an economic standpoint—we, of course, don’t comment on immigration
policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not ours to make or comment on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But what you see is a—an, an unemployment rate
that has been really solid and at a low level—not really increasing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s been in a—in a good
range and well within the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that
means, like, part of that is that labor demand and labor supply are kind of moving down at the
same rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Labor demand is, is softening—you see that in job creation—but it’s still kind of at a
healthy level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And labor supply is, is diminishing because the, the immigration numbers that we
Page 14 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see are, are much lower than they were.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So the—those two factors, supply and demand—that’s
what has kept the, the unemployment rate in a reasonably, you know, stable place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, thanks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other thing I wanted to follow up on is if
you could—if you could elaborate on the potential changes to the SEP that you suggested were
part of the framework review, I think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the framework review really has two tracks, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The first track
is our—is our policy framework.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that is reflected in the consensus statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we,
we’ve said that we would finish that and announce it by the end of the summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re well
along in that process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve had the meetings that we need to have, and we’re now going to be
going into [cough]—pardon me—into discussions about, you know, specific changes to
language.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—that’s the framework part of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The second part of it is our
communications tools and practices [cough]—pardon me—and that, that part comes next, okay?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’re going to do in the meetings this fall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Actually, what we did at this meeting,
though, is we, we sort of prepared the ground for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had a—we had a meeting where we
talked at a high level about a number of ideas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The SEP is part of it—you know, other—many, many other ideas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—it’s sort of—
how do we think our communications can be improved?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are a number of ideas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People
offered a really—it was a great conversation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Number of ideas—but we’re—we’re going to look
at those with staff briefing and a lot of thought in the fall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would say, when it comes to
changing communications, you know, I would only do—I would only support things really that
only—implement things that have very broad support.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, you want to be really careful,
because I think our communications are pretty well received.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not broken, so more is not
Page 15 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
necessarily better—but better is better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re going to be looking at ways to do—to do things
that will improve the clarity of what we do for the benefit of, of the public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kelly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KELLY O’GRADY.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kelly O’Grady, CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re
famously known as the guy that makes decision based on data instead of speculation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’ve
said today in—the inflation data is in a good place—we don’t know how tariffs are going to
impact prices going forward—that’s uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I’ve got to go back to the last time that you
cut rates in December, and there was still the what-if of tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So what made you feel
comfortable cutting then, when inflation was higher than where it is today—and you didn’t cut
today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, the, the forecast for inflation in December was 2½ core PCE
for 2025—the forecast was 2½ percent—which is a good inflation forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think what we’ve
learned is that—and this was long before we had any idea of what the actual policies would be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’ve learned the tariffs are going to be substantially larger than, than forecasters generally
thought.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we, we don’t—our, our forecasts are generally not particularly
different from those of other, you know, well-resourced forecasting operations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So what we
learned—and particularly in April—was that substantially larger tariffs were coming and that
that would mean higher inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so you—now you see—you saw
2½ percent forecast in December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You saw 2.8 percent in March, and you see 3.1 percent now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s six-tenths higher inflation for 2025, and that’s—that’s a big part of, of the change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s—that’s due to the effects of, of the tariffs that are—you know, we, we don’t know where
Page 16 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
they’re going to land, but it’s pretty apparent they’re going to land higher than outside
forecasters were really guessing at the end of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My follow-up to that—I think consumers—right?—were looking
for relief on rates when it comes to mortgages—car loans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Small businesses want to take out
more manageable loans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>When you look at the cumulative inflation over the past five years,
prices have risen over 20 percent—it’s been a rough road.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what is the tipping point, then, for
the wait-and-see approach in terms of how much it’s going to help versus when it hurts the
American consumer?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Well, I mean, we’re trying to restore price—the best thing we can do
for the—for the public that we serve is restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If we can, and we will, restore
price stability, meaning 2 percent inflation on a durable, sustainable basis—that and also
maximum employment—and if we, we restore those things, that’s the best thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that is our
goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The best thing we can do for the American people—for, for households and businesses—
that is the ultimate thing that we can deliver.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they can make their decisions without having
to think about inflation all the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, in the meantime, we have to keep rates high to keep—to
get inflation all the way down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not very high—let’s be honest.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say policy is
modestly or moderately—probably modestly now—restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at the economy, it’s
not performing as though it were performing under very strict monetary policy—very restrictive
monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I would say probably modestly restrictive—and so what it will take is, is
confidence that inflation is coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, I would say, without tariffs, that confidence would be building because if you—if
you see what’s happening with nonhousing services and housing services, which are the other
two big pieces other than goods, those are coming down really nicely now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we have to
Page 17 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
learn a little more about, about tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know—I don’t know what the right way for us to
react will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s hard to know with, with any confidence how we should react until we
see, really, the size of the effects—then we can start to make a better judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So that’s what
we’re doing, and I think we can—we can take the time to do that, because unemployment is
4.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wages are moving up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Real wages are moving up at a—at a healthy clip now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
inflation is, you know—2.3 percent headline inflation over a 12-month basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a good
economy, and a solid economy with decent growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re saying that uncertainty
has come down, the economy is moving at a solid pace, inflation has come down over the past
three months, and this is all moving in the right direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So are you indicating here that
Americans should expect some sort of economic pain in the second half of the year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not—I’m not saying that at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, from our standpoint,
what I can say is that the, the U.S. economy is in solid shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
unemployment rate remains at 4.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, real wages are moving up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a—
it’s a good—job creation is at a healthy level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Unemployment, again, as I said, low—labor force
participation at a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What we’re waiting for to reduce rates is, is to understand what
will happen with, with, really, the tariff inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there’s a lot of uncertainty about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Every forecaster you can name who, you know—who is a professional, you know, forecaster
with, with adequate resources and forecasts for a living is forecasting, you know, a pretty
significant—everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming
months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it will be someone in that
chain that I mentioned: Between the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer—
Page 18 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
ultimately, somebody putting it into a, a good of some kind or just the consumer buying it—and,
you know, all through that, that chain, people will be trying not to be the ones who, who pick up
the cost.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And some of it will fall on the end
consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that because that’s what businesses say—that’s what the, the data say from
past—so we know that’s coming.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we just want to see, see a little bit of that before we make
judgments prematurely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And follow-up on that—so you’ve spent years, though,
talking about how, how you’re data dependent, and be a little more direct on this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
now you’re making decisions looking forward—doesn’t the data you’re seeing today indicate
there should be a rate cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I mean, you’re—monetary policy has to be forward looking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is elementary.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got to be looking—I always—we always talk about the incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We say that over and over and over again,
right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s always forward looking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, if you know—at the very beginning of the
pandemic, you know, we cut rates to zero immediately.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nothing had happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just knew
that it was going to be really bad, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we took very aggressive forward looking—because
we knew things were going to be unusually difficult.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, of course, this, this is something we,
we sort of know is coming—we just don’t know the size of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, the economy seems to
be in solid shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the labor market’s not crying out for a rate cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Businesses, you know,
were in a bit of shock after April 2.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you see business sentiment—you talk to business people
now—there’s a very different feeling now that people are working their way through this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
they, they understand how they’re going to go, and it’s—it, it feels much more positive and
Page 19 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
constructive than it did three months ago, let’s say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, again, we think that our current stance of
monetary policy is in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Amara.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>AMARA OMEOKWE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell,
in February, you told Congress that the Fed is “overworked, maybe, not overstaffed.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then, in a
memo to—a memo to staff in May announcing a deferred resignation program at the Fed, you
said you wanted to ensure that the Fed was “right-sized.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those two statements appear to be at
odds with one another.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you explain what changed in the roughly three months between
those statements that made you decide that staff levels at the Fed should decline?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t see them at all as, as in tension.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, so I was asked,
“Is the Fed overstaffed?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I said, “No.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, and I sort of said as a pun,
“Overworked, but not overstaffed.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People do work extremely hard at the Fed, and I know they
work hard at Bloomberg, too. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Laughter] So—but we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We work hard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would say
this—so we are careful stewards of public resources, and sometimes you need to show that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
there’ve been several times in our history—modern history—where the Fed has said, “You know
what?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to do a buyout.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to—going to show the public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to
demonstrate that we are good stewards of public resources.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we thought—and I, I thought—
that this is a time when we can.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ve—we grow about—our headcount has grown
at about 1 percent a year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So over the course of a couple of years, we’re going to—we’re doing a
careful scrub of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks, and we’re going to find 10 percent of
employees who can do something else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where, where we can—we can streamline our operations—and we, we think we can get
there in a year, in a couple of years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think we can do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think the—we think the,
Page 20 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the—this is, this is without taking risk to carrying out our critical missions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is something
you do very carefully—thoughtfully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you do it, again, respecting that we have critical
missions to carry out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve had experience—a lot of experience—in my prior careers, you know,
with headcount reductions and things like that, and this is how you do it professionally.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You do
it carefully—thoughtfully—with a lot of planning, and you do it over a period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I
think it’s—I think the Fed will be fine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think no one will notice any decline in our ability to
carry out our missions, and I think it’s just us wanting to demonstrate to the public that we are
actually good stewards of their—of their resources.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re—we’re effectively wiping out
10 years of headcount growth with this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I mean, we just—we wanted to show that, you
know—that we’re good stewards.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How is progress on reducing the headcount going so far?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are
you on track to meet the goal?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re just at the very beginning.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you know, we’re doing a
buyout program.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to—we’re going to hit that goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think many organizations find
that they can—that they can do this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You don’t want to do it every year or anything, but you can
do it at intervals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you, you wind up not, you know—not interfering with your ability to
perform your jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, Claire Jones from the Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you’re no
doubt aware, the Senate Finance Committee has tabled its version of the reconciliation bill this
week, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the tenor of the debate at the
FOMC over the past few days on fiscal policy and the degree to which that influenced people’s
projections for 2026 and beyond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 21 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so, you know, we don’t—we don’t sit around and debate or
really discuss—we, we take fiscal policy as fully exogenous.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we, we actually, you know,
really didn’t talk about, about the bill or the contents of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s still evolving.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, when,
when it gets close—closer—remember also we have a very, very large economy, and that the
effects will be at the margin.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I, I expect that they’ll—they may already be in—
but they will be in by the next meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll make an estimate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s not a major thing; it’s
nothing that we discuss.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It, it may have been mentioned a couple of times—but as something
that’s coming in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think the outcome is—you know, we don’t know the outcome yet
there—so, hard to be real specific.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin with Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’ve been some
cutbacks in economic statistics collection in the last few weeks—worries that long-running
problems around funding and response rates may be getting worse.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much is this concern on
your radar?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much confidence do you have that the gauges you’re watching to assess the
economy are reliable right now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, two things—one, the data we get right now—we, we can
do our jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not concerned that we can’t do our jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not the—that’s not the point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The point, really, is that we are starting to see, you know, layoffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and important gatherers
of data are saying that they’re—they’re having to cut back on the size of their surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
going to lead to more volatility in the surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we should take a step back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, from our standpoint—and I think the standpoint of businesses and governments and
everyone—having really good data on the state of the economy at any given time is a huge
public good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It helps.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t just help the Fed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It helps the government, it helps Congress, it
Page 22 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
helps the executive branch.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>More importantly, really, it helps businesses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They need to know
what’s going on in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The United States has been a leader for many, many years in
this whole project of measuring and understanding what’s happening in, in our very large and
dynamic economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I hate to see—I hate to see us cutting back on that because it, it is a real benefit to
the general public that people in all kinds of jobs have the best possible understanding of what’s
happening in the economy and, and, hence, what’s likely to happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very hard to measure
what’s going on in the U.S. economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If, if you read—there was a book called—well, it’s really
remarkable how many things you need to understand to estimate U.S. GDP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Very, very
difficult—and it’s so important that we get it right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just would—I just would say it’s not a
place to—I would want to keep investing in that, you know, for the good of the general public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re conducting this
monetary policy strategy framework review, but next year we’re supposed to have a new Fed
Chair, and I’m wondering if that affects at all the way that you’re approaching this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you
ensure that this framework will actually be durable?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the framework goes back to—the framework document
goes back to 2012, and it’s—it’s the Committee’s document.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not like we’re going to invent a
brand new way to do things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—it’s been an evolving document, so it shouldn’t depend on
who the Chair is at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It should depend on what’s happening in the economy and what the
Committee wants to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, yeah, it isn’t really tied to any particular Chair, and, you know, we
used to renew it every year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now we do it every five years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but I, I don’t think anybody—
I’ve never heard anyone raise this issue that, you know, a new Chair might want to come in and
Page 23 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
go in a completely different direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I really—I really don’t think that’s right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know,
that’s not—not going to be up to me to decide.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that affecting at all that you’re—who you’re consulting with—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, not at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not in any way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Matt Egan from CNN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Relatively low gas
prices this year have helped drive down inflation in recent reports, but that trend is starting to
reverse, given the crisis in the Middle East.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How are you thinking about how the Israel–Iran
conflict will impact the economy, especially inflation, and what lessons were learned during the
2022 period when another conflict, the Russia–Ukraine war, sent oil and gas prices
skyrocketing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, of course, we’re watching—like everybody else is—what’s going
on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I really don’t have any comment on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, possible that, that we’ll see higher
energy prices—what’s tended to happen is, when there’s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see
a spike in energy prices—but tends to come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those things don’t generally tend to have
lasting effects on inflation, although, of course, in the 1970s, they famously did, because you had
a series of very, very large shocks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we haven’t seen anything like that—that—like that now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The U.S. economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, but—
MATT EGAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A quick follow-up—I’ve just got to ask you about artificial intelligence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some technology executives have recently been warning that AI could wipe out a large chunk of
entry-level jobs and significantly increase the unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I’m wondering how
concerned you are, if at all, about the threat that AI poses to employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 24 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question really is, will AI be more
augmenting labor or replacing labor?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I wouldn’t—I, I—we all see those announcements,
including one today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t overread a, a couple of data points, because, you know, AI
should be creating jobs at the same time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It may be replacing—it may be doing both.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Anyone
who’s done any work with it—with AI—will, will have been a little bit stunned at how capable it
is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s just a different thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think this is something that certainly has transformational
potential—and probably we’re in the very early stages of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They say what you’re seeing now
compared to what you’ll see in two years is, is going to be very different and even more
effective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s really hard to know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, of course, there are optimists who feel
like it’s going to make everybody much more, you know—much more productive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there are
those who think it’s going to replace an awful lot of jobs right across the income spectrum—you
know, white collar, blue collar, and everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I just don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t—we don’t have
a “house view” on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But this is—this is going to be a very important question for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GREG ROBB.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was wondering if you
could step back a little bit, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, there’s a spate of articles and a lot of op-
eds now in the newspapers saying that the U.S. economy and the global economy is going
through this profound change, you know, akin to the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And don’t you owe the American people, like, some sort of, like, explanation for what we’re
going through?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I, I noticed earlier this month when you, you talked about Bretton
Woods a little bit, and you said that Bretton Woods—the Fed staff had to, like, change how
they’ve—the dollar—movements of the dollar was impacting the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are we going
Page 25 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through something like that now—that, you know—are you having to change how you do
monetary policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it—is it that fundamental of a change under way?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—it’s certainly a time of real change—you know, from a
geopolitical standpoint, from a trade standpoint, from an immigration standpoint—you see this
not just here, but everywhere.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s—there’s quite a lot going on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t change the
way we do monetary policy in the near term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, but—and it doesn’t change our objectives
or what we need to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, these, these things are not really our issues—they’re
really issues for elected governments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All of those issues are really for elected governments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But there’s no question it’s a time of, of real, real change—and very hard to see where that goes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Will it be—there have been many, many things written about how it’s going to be a more
inflationary time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s possible; it’s not guaranteed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, AI could cut in a very other
direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>AI could make people much more productive and—and push in the other direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
don’t know, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So you’re right, but, honestly, our focus is, is a much more practical one,
and that is, how do we keep inflation low and, and employment high in the near term?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
really what we’re about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mark Hamrick.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MARK HAMRICK.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hello, Chairman Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mark Hamrick with
Bankrate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is the view about the growing amount of slack in the job market, including the
softening in payrolls, the forecast of a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and the ability of
workers to demand wage hikes or not in this environment where you have inflation surging?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I don’t, you don’t see—you don’t really see unemployment going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You don’t see increased slack, really—I mean, at the margin.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember, you’re at 4.2 percent
unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that was for many, many years—that was an extremely low level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
Page 26 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens to have come up off of an even lower level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we came out of the pandemic, we were
as low as 3.4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But 4.2 percent is probably at the low end of estimates of the longer-run,
you know, sustainable level of natural rate of unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t—I guess I wouldn’t
agree with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, in terms of wages—you know, real wages after inflation have been
moving up sort of more than was consistent with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re still moving up at
a—at a healthy clip—and I think much more consistent with 2 percent inflation, given, given a, a
reasonable assessment of, of trend productivity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a pretty good labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
you’re right that the level of job creation has come down, but so has the supply of workers—the
change in the supply—the, the new supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So you’ve seen—you’ve seen the unemployment rate remain pretty stable at 4.2.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
been as high as 4.3, but, you know, those are—those are good numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a pretty good
labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s—the thing is, there’s—a more concerning thing is, there’s not—there are
not a lot of layoffs, but there are not a lot of, of job creation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The number—if you’re out of
work, it’s—it’s hard to find a job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But very few people are being laid off at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So
that’s—an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully, because if there were to be, you know,
significant layoffs and the job-finding rate were to remain this low, you would have a lot—you
would have an increase in unemployment fairly quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It really
hasn’t happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re—so the U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to, to
weaken, really, over the last three years, and it’s been remarkable to see—just again and again
when people think it’s going to weaken out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Eventually it will, but we don’t see signs of
that now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Go to Jean for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 27 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEAN YUNG.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s been a lot
of talk about cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wanted to ask you—why do you think there are no forecasts for rates to rise
or, or even to stay where they are next year, given that the projection for inflation is to rise to
3 percent and there’s a lot of—there’s some skepticism over whether those price hikes will be a
one-time event?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there are a number of people on the Committee who wrote down
no cuts this year but some cuts next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, look, I think, you know, people are writing down
their most likely path, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not saying there’s zero possibility of other things, really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Really, it’s—think of it as the least unlikely path in a situation like this where uncertainty is very
high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think—again, people write—they write down their, their rate paths, and they do not
have, like, a really high conviction that this is exactly what’s going to happen over the next two
years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one feels that way about their rate path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They feel like, “What am I going to write
down?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, what would you write down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not easy to, to be—to do that with
confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would just say it that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t rule things in or out—certainly, a hike is not
the base case at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something people are writing down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, in the meantime, we do the
best we can with these forecasts, and I, I think they’re—they’re representative of, you know, of
the different forecasts and different reaction functions that people on the Committee have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So thank you very much.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 7, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to
have risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to
respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Cough] Pardon me.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were likely driven by businesses bringing in
imports ahead of potential tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This unusual swing complicated GDP measurement last
quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the first quarter, the
same as last year’s pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated while
investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated
uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It remains to
be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged
155,000 per month over the past three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wage growth has continued to moderate,
while still outpacing inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the
12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices
rose 2.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, as reflected in
both market- and survey-based measures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Survey respondents, including consumers, businesses,
and professional forecasters, point to tariffs as the driving factor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Beyond the next year or so,
however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent
inflation goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The tariff increases
announced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All of these policies are still
evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As economic
conditions evolve, we’ll continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based
on the incoming data, the outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Page 2 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to
generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The effects on inflation could be short lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It is
also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Avoiding that
outcome will depend on the size of the tariffs’ effect—tariff effects, on how long it takes for
them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation
expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As we act to
meet that obligation, we’ll balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For the time being, we’re well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any
adjustments to our policy stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We focused on inflation dynamics and the implications for
our monetary policy strategy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference next
week.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Throughout this process, we’re open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take
on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We intend to wrap up the
review by late summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 3 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Mr. Chair, for taking my
question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A lot has happened since the last meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There have been tariffs put on, tariffs taken
off, and meanwhile, there was a bill advancing in Congress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I just wonder if I could press
you on the last part of your statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you any closer now to deciding which side of the
mandate is going to need urgent care first?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, so, as we noted in our—in our statement—postmeeting
statement, we’ve judged that the risks to higher employment and higher inflation have both risen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this, by the way, of course, is compared to March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what we can say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think
we can say, you know, which way this will shake out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty
about, for example, where tariff policies are going to, to settle out and also, when they do settle
out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s
too early to know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I mean, ultimately, we think our policy rate is in—is in a good place
to stay as we await further clarity on tariffs and, ultimately, their implications for the economy.</del></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hearing you describe what you’re looking for in terms of being able
to make a decision, it sounded like that’s a long-term process before you sound like you’re going
to be comfortable, or the Committee would be comfortable, to act on what the data’s telling you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think we know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I think—look where we are
today.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We have an economy that, if you “look through,” you know, the sort of distortions in Q1
GDP, you’ve still got an economy that looks like it’s growing at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market
appears to be solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation is running just a bit above 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s an economy that’s
been resilient and is in good shape, and our policy is sort of modestly or moderately restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was last fall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we think that leaves us in a good
place to wait and see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t think we need to be in a hurry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think we can be patient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to be watching the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The data may move quickly or slowly, but we do think
we’re in a good position, where we are, to, to let things evolve and become clearer in terms of
what should be the monetary policy response.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos for the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, there’s
naturally a lot of [inaudible] around 2021 in supply shocks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But there are some who argue that
the current situation has notable differences.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Energy costs are down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Housing imbalances look
nothing like they did four years ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor demand appears to be gradually cooling, with wage
growth running below 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What do you see right now that could nourish higher inflation
beyond a rise in goods prices this year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the underlying inflation picture is, is good.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s what you see,
which is inflation now running a bit above 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve had basically decent readings
in housing services and nonhousing services, which is a big part of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that part, I think is, is
moving along well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But there’s just so much that we don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think—and we’re in a good position to
wait and see, is the thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t have to be in a hurry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is—has been resilient
and is doing fairly well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our policy is well positioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The costs of waiting to see further are
fairly low, we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’ll, we’ll see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
Administration is entering into negotiations with many countries over tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll know more
with each week and month that goes by where—about where tariffs are going to land—you
know, land, and we’ll know what the effects will be when we start to see those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we
think we’ll be learning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can’t tell you how long it will take.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, for now, it does seem like
it’s, it’s, it’s a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see and watch.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when you say that you don’t need to be in a hurry, does that mean
that—could the outlook change in such a way that a change in your stance could be warranted as
soon as your next meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, as I said, we’re—we are comfortable with our policy
stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think the right—we’re in the right place to wait and see how things evolve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
don’t feel like we need to be in a hurry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We feel like it’s appropriate to be patient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, when things develop—of course, we have a record of—we can move quickly when that’s
appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we think right now, the appropriate thing to do is to wait and see how things
evolve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s so much uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you talk to businesses or market participants or
forecasters, everyone is just—is just waiting to see how developments play out, and then we’ll be
able to make a better assessment of what the appropriate path for monetary policy is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re
not in that place, and, you know, as that develops—and I can’t really give you a time frame
on that.</del></p>

JONNELLE MARTE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, many economists have been
pricing in higher odds of a recession, and several are noting that it is more difficult for the Fed to
cut rates preemptively, given the higher risks for higher inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, given the outlook, do you
still see a path for a soft landing, and what does that look like?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, let me say—I mean, so let’s, let’s, let’s look back and see
where we are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, go through 2024 up to the [present] day.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve had—we’ve had, you know,
unemployment in the low 4s for more than a year, we’ve had inflation coming down in the—now
in the mid-to-low 2s, and we’ve had an economy growing at 2½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that is—that is the
economy as we see it now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we
will see the—certainly, the risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
if that’s what we do see, if—and if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we
don’t know, then, then we will see—we won’t see further progress toward our goals, but we
might see a delay in that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think in the—you know, in our thinking, we would get—we would
never—we never do anything but keep achieving those goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what we would—at least for
the next, let’s say, year, we would—we would not be making progress toward those goals, again,
if that is—if that’s the way the tariffs shake out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The thing is, we don’t know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s so
much uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of the tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
terms of preemption, you know, I think you can look back at the 2019 cuts as preemptive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
wouldn’t say that what we did last fall was at all preemptive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If anything, it was a little late.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
2019, we did cut three times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the situation was, you had a weakening economy, and you had
inflation at 1.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s a situation where you can move preemptively.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Now we have
inflation running above target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has been above target for four years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not so far above
target now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we have an expectation conditional on what happens that we’ll see upward
pressure on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at where forecasters are, they’re all forecasting an increase in
Page 7 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it makes it—and then we’ve also got, you know, forecasts of weakening in the
economy, and some have recession forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t make a—we don’t make—publish a
forecast about, about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t publish a forecast that assesses how likely a recession is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, in any case, it’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don’t
know what the right response to, to the data will be until we see more data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>How much weakness does the
Committee need to see, though, in the labor market and the economy more broadly to lower
interest rates again?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is it about a certain increase in the unemployment rate over a period of
time, or perhaps a certain number of negative monthly job reports?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, how are you making
that assessment?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, so first of all, we don’t see that yet, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have
4.2 percent unemployment, good participation, wages behaving very well, participation, I
mentioned, at a good level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, with the labor market, we would look at the totality of
the—of the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’d look at the level of the unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’d look at the speed with
which it’s changing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We would look at the whole huge array of labor market data to, to get a
sense of whether conditions are really deteriorating or not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, at the same time, we’d be
looking at the other side of the mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We could be in a position of having to balance those
two things, which is, of course, a very—a difficult balancing judgment that we’d have to make.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On that point about balancing, I mean, you’ve mentioned that the
Committee would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the time it would take to
kind of get back to that point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what does that mean in practice?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, how much of that
assessment will be rooted in a forecast, versus data dependence?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would be a combination of the two.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, let’s just say this is
a—this would be a complicated and challenging judgment that we would have to make if—and
this is—we’re not in this situation, but the situation is if the two goals are in tension.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So let’s say
that unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way and so is inflation—not the situation
we’re in—hypothetically.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they’re
expected to be from the goals, what’s the expected time to get back to their goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’d look at
all those things and make a difficult judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s in our framework.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s always been in
our thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s—we haven’t had—we haven’t faced that question in a very long
time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, again, difficult, difficult judgment to make, and not one that we face today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
we may never face it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we have to be keeping it in our thinking now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we had
the CPI report that came out that showed, month over month, the first increase in inflation in
about three years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The jobs report—you said “solid”—that we saw.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, we have
those new tariffs that we’re living under.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, given this, should the Federal Reserve be cutting
rates at all this year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s going to depend.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think you have to just take a step
back and realize this is—this is why we are where we are, is, you know, we are going to need to
see how this evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are cases in which it wouldn’t, and we just don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Until we know more about
how this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment, for—and
for, for inflation, I couldn’t confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 9 of 25

EDWARD LAWRENCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, following on that, just, you know—so then how does
President Trump calling on you personally as well as the Federal Reserve to make rate cuts affect
your decision today and affect your job difficulty?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>[0:18:00]
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Doesn’t affect our—doing our job at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we—you know, we’re
always going to do the same thing—which is, we’re going to use our tools to foster maximum
employment and price stability for the benefit of the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re always going to
consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s it, that’s all we’re
going to consider.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering—I mean, given the complexity about the first-quarter GDP and what lies ahead,
I’m just wondering what your intuition tells you about the underlying direction of the economy
right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many of your colleagues have said they feel growth is slowing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If so, do you have
any sense of by how much, to what degree the slowdown may be?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What does your gut tell you
about how things are evolving out there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is
extremely elevated [laughter] and that the downside risks have increased.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The risk is—as we
pointed out in our statement, the risks—the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation
have risen, but they haven’t materialized yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They really haven’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re not, really not in the
data yet, so that—and that tells me more than by intuition because I think—I think it’s obvious,
actually, that the right thing for us to do is to—we’re in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our policy’s in a very
good place, and the right thing to do is, is await further clarity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I—you know, there’s—
usually, things clarify, and that—the appropriate direction becomes clear.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what usually
Page 10 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Right now, it’s very hard to say what that would be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the meantime, the
economy is doing fine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our policy isn’t—you know, it’s not highly restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s somewhat
restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was in, you know, last summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we
think it’s—we think it’s in a good place, and we think the appropriate thing is for us to wait and
see and get more clarity about, about the direction of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, let me press you on this idea of the economy being fine
right now, because, reading the Beige Book very closely the last time around, there was a lot of,
you know, negative stuff, negative sentiment that was in there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I know that everybody’s
looking at soft data right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned it yourself—that the sentiment’s sour.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the
Beige Book was talking about, you know, the beginnings of layoffs in some industries, prices
rising in, in some places, and an awful lot of investment decisions being, being pushed to the
sideline.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Doesn’t that point to a slowdown?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just hasn’t shown up yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, we all
look at all these sentiments and read many, many individual comments just to get a better feel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it—you know, businesses and households very broadly are concerned and, you know,
postponing economic decisions of various kinds.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, yes, if that continues and nothing,
nothing happens to sort of alleviate those concerns, then you would expect that to begin to show
up in economic data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It wouldn’t maybe show up overnight, but it would show up over weeks
and months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that may be what happens, but it hasn’t happened yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, there are
things that can happen that will—that will change that narrative.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, they haven’t happened,
but it’s possible to imagine things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in the meantime, yes, we’re watching it extremely
carefully, like everyone is, but don’t see really much evidence of it in the actual economic data
yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And by the way, consumers keep spending, credit card spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—you know, it’s
Page 11 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
still—it’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment
on the part of people and businesses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
Fed’s been criticized recently by a former Governor for what he calls “mission creep”—you take
on more problems, use more tools, and then end up building tools to deal with the fallout of those
tools, which then makes it a given that you will act more aggressively in the future.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that a fair
critique, and is that something you would be looking at in your framework review?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, say that critique again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That the Fed has been involved in mission creep—gets involved in
using too many new tools to deal with problems and to go too far.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that something that—the
critique was based around the fact that you did QE and QE and QE and—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Oh, okay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MICHAEL MCKEE. —</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>and went beyond the narrow confines of your mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—well, I mean, there are a couple—that’s not really beyond the
confines of our mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—look, I would say this: We—you know, we did things—essentially,
we were on an emergency footing for a couple of years in the pandemic, and it’s very fair and
very welcome for people to look back over what we did and say, “Hey, you could have done this
better and different.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And one thing we hear a lot is, we could have explained the QE a little
better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We did think we were explaining it in real time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I completely accept the, the thought that
we could have explained it better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a lot of thinking that we went on too long with QE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
can tell you that the reason we did was, we were—we were concerned that we didn’t want a
tightening of—a sharp tightening in financial conditions at a time when we thought the economy
Page 12 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was still vulnerable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we did hold on for a long time to QE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we, of course, tapered
and everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then we immediately went into QT, and, you know, we’ve—we’re down a
couple of trillion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I get the—that, you know, we, we certainly, with the benefit of hindsight,
could have tapered earlier or faster.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s absolutely right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But this is all very welcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
know, it’s, it’s—you know, we knew, doing this in real time, that we weren’t going to get it
perfect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And those kind of—those kind of, you know, after-action kind of looks are essential.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re doing the same thing in—you know, in our review, so—on some issues.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There—the other part of that critique is that you’ve taken on topics
that are outside of the mandate, such as climate change and trying to ensure that certain groups
are benefited by your economic policies in terms of employment, et cetera.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, okay, on climate, you’ve heard me say over and over again that
we will not be climate policymakers and that our role on climate is a very, very narrow one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
I think—I think that’s what we’ve done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve done really very little on climate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can say
that was—that little bit that we’ve done was too much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I wouldn’t want to give any
impression that, that, you know, we take—that we’ve taken climate in and it’s something that
we’re spending a lot of time and energy on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have very, very narrow things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
did one thing, one guidance for the banks, and then we did one—a one-time stress analysis,
climate stress analysis, and that’s it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we dropped out of the Network for
Greening the Financial System.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we didn’t do much on climate, but—and I do think, and I’ve
said this publicly several times, I think it’s, it’s a real danger for us to try to take on a mandate
like that, which is very narrow application to our work.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the risk is, if you—if
you go for things that are really not on your mandate, you know, then why are you independent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I think that’s a very fair question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I do think we’ve done a whole lot less on
climate than some people seem to think we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Anyway, that’s what I think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 13 of 25

MICHAEL MCKEE.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Should you have taken on the question of bringing unemployment
rates down for specific categories?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, we said—what we said was that we
never targeted any unemployment rate for individual racial or demographic groups.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What we
said was that maximum employment was a broad and inclusive goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I think what we meant
by that was, we’re going to consider the totality of the country as we look at our maximum-
employment goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we were never going to target on any individual group with that,
but I think some people, you know, wanted to hear it that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s not at all what we
meant.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—so that’s just not a correct reading of our—but I can see how, you know, maybe
people found that confusing, and, you know, we have to take that into consideration.</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our questions today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m Jo Ling
Kent with CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve said, “Wait and see” and “The economy is doing fine” today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the impact of tariffs are already showing up at the ports.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Businesses big and small are telling
us that they feel it, and most importantly, consumers say they feel it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the challenges are here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there’s no waiting and seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For Main Street, what is the breaking point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What would
have to happen to prompt a rate cut specifically?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you know, so we really don’t see in the data yet big economic
effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We see—we see sentiment, their concerns that higher prices may be coming, or things
like that, but—so people, they’re worried now about inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re worried about, you
know, a shock from the tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But they really haven’t—that shock hasn’t hit yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Okay, so, you
know, we’re going to be looking at not just the sentiment data, but also the real economic data as
we assess what it is we should do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And remember, we’re—there will be two effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One of
them would be weakening economy—weakening economic activity, which translates into higher
Page 14 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployment, and the other would be potentially higher inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, to say it again, the
timing, the scope, the scale, and the persistence of those effects are very, very uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s
not at all clear what the appropriate response for monetary policy is at this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re—
you know—and by the way, our policy’s in a good place, so we think we can wait and move
when it is clear what the right thing to do is; really not at all clear what it is we should do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So
people are feeling stress and concern, but unemployment hasn’t gone up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job creation is fine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages are in good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, people are not—layoffs are—people are not getting laid
off at high levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, initial claims for unemployment are not increasing, you know, in
any kind of impressive way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the economy itself is still, you know, in solid shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just a quick follow-up: President Trump now says he does not plan to
remove you as Chair.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When you heard that, what did you think?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t have anything more for you on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve pretty much
covered that issue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I
just wanted to follow up.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Earlier, it sounded like you said it was unclear how the Fed—you
know, what kind of interest rate decisions you will make later this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So does that—you
know, in March, there was guidance that two cuts might happen, you know, two cuts were
penciled in for this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that now—that guidance from the last press conference, has that
been overtaken by events at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we don’t do a Summary of Economic Projections at
every meeting, as you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do it every other meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so this was the meeting when
we didn’t do it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I—you know, we don’t also kind of poll people, so I really—I really
wouldn’t want to try to make a specific projection for where we are relative to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will—in
Page 15 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
six weeks, we have the June meeting, and you’ll have another SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not going to hazard a
guess here today what—as to what it would be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, what I would say is that we think our
policy rate is in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think it leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to
potential developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s where we are, and that—depending on the way things play out,
that could include rate hikes—sorry, rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it could include us holding where we
are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just are going to need to see, you know, how things play out before we make those
decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to follow up on that, I mean, when you
address the issue of how the Fed would handle both rising unemployment and rising inflation,
how are you thinking about the fact that addressing one could exacerbate the other?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So a rate cut
to reduce unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How does that—how do you
handle those challenges?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you just captured the—this is the issue with the two goals
being in tension.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a very challenging question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, there can be a case in which one goal is
very far—one variable’s very far from its goal, much farther than the other.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if so, you
concentrate on that one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, frankly, that was the case—well, it wasn’t a case where they were
really in tension.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But if you go back to 2022, it was very clear that we needed to focus on
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market was also super tight, so it wasn’t really a tradeoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, if—I
think you know what our—what our framework document says.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It says we’ll look at how far
each goal—each variable is from its goal and also we’ll factor in the time it would take to get
there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, that’s going to be a—potentially, a very difficult judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the data
could break in a way that it’s not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I just don’t think we know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The data could
easily favor one or the other.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And right now, there’s no way to—no need to make a choice and
no real basis for doing so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask, Congress is
currently debating spending cuts alongside expending—extending the tax cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I know
you’ve talked many times about how the path of the debt is unsustainable.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But given that we’re
also talking right now about the economy slowing, potentially even recession, I was just
wondering, is there a danger that spending cuts now could slow growth a lot more?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we don’t give Congress fiscal advice.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—they’re going
to do—we take what they do as a given, and we put it in our models and in our assessment of the
economy, so I wouldn’t want to, you know, speculate on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I think we do know that
the debt is on an unsustainable level—on an unsustainable path—not on an unsustainable level,
but an unsustainable path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s on Congress to figure out how to get us back on a sustainable
path, and, you know, it’s not up to us to give them advice.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, do you think that they should take macroeconomic
conditions into account as they look at this?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think they don’t need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal
policy any more than we need their advice on monetary policy. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter]
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Andrew Ackerman with the
Washington Post.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In your Jackson Hole comments last year, you said you would not welcome
further cooling in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate then was 4.2 percent, which
is what it is now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Forecasters—many forecasters now predict a higher jobless rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>How has
your tolerance for weakening labor market conditions changed compared to a year ago?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it was quite a different situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What was happening last year is
that over the space of six, eight, seven months, the unemployment rate went up by almost a full
Page 17 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know,
everywhere, people were talking about downside risks to the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time,
payroll job numbers were getting softer and softer.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So there was a really obvious concern about
downside risk to the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so at Jackson Hole and then in September, you know, we
wanted to address that forthrightly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We wanted to show that we were there for the—I mean, we
had been there for inflation for a couple of years, and we wanted to show also that we’re there
for the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it was important that we send that signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Fortunately, since then, the
labor market has really—and the unemployment rate have really been moving sideways at a level
that is, you know, well in the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that
concern has gotten a lot less.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, you know, you’re at 4.2 percent unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we
were in a very different situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And now we have a situation where, you know, the risks to
higher inflation and higher unemployment have both gone up, as we noted in our statement, and
we’ve got to monitor both of those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We actually have a potential situation where there may be a
tradeoff or tension between the two potentially.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t have it yet, and we may not have it,
but that’s what we [may] have, and that’s why I think it’s a very different, different situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I mean, I guess I want to follow up by asking how much of
a rise in the jobless rate you would—you could tolerate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can’t give you a—you know, a—I’m not going to try to give you a
specific number.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I’ll just say, we’ve got—we have to now be looking at both variables and
which of them is, is, you know, demanding—if one of them is demanding our focus more than
the other, that would tell us what to do with policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If they’re more or less this, you know,
equally distant and equally—or not distant, then we don’t have to make that assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
know, the assessment is, you wait.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m not going to try to be really specific about what we
need to see in terms of the number.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if—look, if we did see, you know, significant
Page 18 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deterioration in the labor market, of course that’s one of our two variables, and we would look to
be able to support that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’d hope that it wasn’t also coming at a time when inflation was
getting very bad.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, we’re speculating here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know any
of these things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very hypothetical.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re just going to have to wait and see how the—how it
plays out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of getting some clarity, we’ve
got some talks at the weekend in Geneva between the U.S. and China.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A lot of economists are
ask—are attaching an awful lot of importance to how—what we hear from those talks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How
much importance are you attaching to them in terms of judging what will happen to the U.S.
economy going forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just in a similar vein, you know, some economists are saying it’s
days, not weeks, that we have until we start to put the U.S. economy at risk of seeing a sort of
pandemic here, with shortages and higher prices, if we don’t kind of soothe relations between the
U.S. and China.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it would be good to have your view on that, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, these are not talks that we’re in any way involved in,
so I really can’t comment directly on them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but what I will say is this: You know, we
had—coming out of the March meeting, we, we—the public generally had an assessment of
where tariffs were going.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then April 2 happened, and it was really substantially larger than
anticipated in the forecasts that I’ve seen and in our forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and now we—and now we
have a different—we’re in a new phase where—it seems to be we’re entering a new phase where
the Administration is entering into beginning talks with a number of our important trading
partners.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—that has the potential to change the picture materially or not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I
think it’s going to be very important how that shakes out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I—you know, we simply have to
Page 19 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wait and see how it works out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It certainly could change the picture, and we’re mindful of not
trying to make conclusive judgments about what will happen at a time when the—you know,
when the facts are changing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And just on the fall in shipping volumes from China over these
tensions, I mean, do you share that concern that we could start seeing goods shortages and higher
prices in the coming weeks if this isn’t resolved very quickly?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I don’t want to get my—we’re not—we shouldn’t be
involved, even verbally, in questions about the timing of these things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, we’re—of course,
we follow all that data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see the shipping data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, ultimately, this is for the
Administration to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is—you know, this is their mandate, not ours.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I know they’re—
as you can see, they’re, again, having—beginning to have talks with many nations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that has
the potential to change the picture materially, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kosuke.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KOSUKE TAKAMI.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kosuke Takami with Nikkei.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for doing this.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The
volume of imported goods increased significantly in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do you think the decision
could cause a delay in the impact of tariff on inflation, and does this mean that it will take a
longer time to reduce uncertainty?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The decision we made today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Which decision?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the future decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the volume of imports—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KOSUKE TAKAMI. —</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>imported goods has increased significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the impact of the
imported inflation may delay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, what is the impact to your future decision?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, so, I mean, I think we—I think we think that the—you know,
there was a big spike in imports—right?—very big, historically large, really, and—to beat tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And now that should actually reverse so that it’s—you know, it’s the difference between—it’s
exports minus imports, so—and imports were huge, and so then it conveyed a very negative
contribution to U.S. GDP—annualized GDP in the first quarter, as we all know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that could, in
the second quarter, be reversed so that we have, you know, an unusually large contribution to—
unusually positive.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s very likely as imports drop sharply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You could also have—you know,
very likely you’ll have restatements of the—of the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’ll turn out that consumer
spending was higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It will turn out that inventories were higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so you’ll see—you’ll see
those data revised up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may actually go into the third quarter, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I think it’s going—
this whole process is going to, a little bit, make it harder to make a clean assessment of U.S.
demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mentioned private domestic final purchases, which doesn’t have inventories,
government, or—inventories, government.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Anyway, it’s a cleaner read on private demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But
that, that, too, probably was flattered a little bit by—you know, by strong demand for imports to
be tariffed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that might overstate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a really good reading, 3 percent PDFP in the first
quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That might actually overstate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s not really going to—I don’t think it’s going to
affect our decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will just say, though, that it’s a little confusing and it’s probably less
confusing to us than it would be to the general public as we try to explain this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s
complicated, and, you know, GDP is sending a signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>PDFP is sending a signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a little bit
confusing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think we understand what’s going, and it’s not really going to change things
for us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I guess, you
know, we talked about some of the indications of potential layoffs, price hikes, an economic
slowdown all being evident in the soft data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious why the Fed needs to wait for that to
translate into hard data to, you know, make any type of monetary policy decision, especially if
Page 21 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the hard data is not as timely or might be warped by tariff-related effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you worried that
the soft data might be some sort of false warning?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s—look, the—look at the state of the economies.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The
labor market is solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation is low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can afford to be patient as things unfold.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s no
real cost to our waiting at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also, the sense of it—the sense of it is, we’re not sure what
the right thing will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, there should be some increase in inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There should be
some increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those call for different responses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so until we know—
potentially call for different responses—and so, you know, until we know more, we have the
ability to wait and see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it seems to be a pretty clear decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everyone on the Committee
supported waiting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s why we’re waiting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just a very quick follow-up: There was this sort of vibe
session, if you will, where the sentiments expressed in soft data did not translate into the hard
economic data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you—how are you thinking about that when interpreting some of the signs
in the softer survey data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I think, going back a number of years, the link between
sentiment data and consumer spending has been weak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not been a strong link at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the
other hand, we haven’t had a move of this, you know, speed and size.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it wouldn’t be the case
that we’re looking at this and just completely dismissing it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s another reason to wait and
see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re right that we had a couple of years during the pandemic where people were
saying—just very downbeat surveys and going out and spending money.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that can happen,
and that may happen to some degree here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is an outsized change in
sentiment, though, and so none of us are looking at this and saying that we’re sure one way or
the other.</del></p>

MATT EGAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matt Egan with CNN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you mentioned earlier
that you’re monitoring the shipping data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we have seen in the shipping data that imports
from China into the Port of Los Angeles have plunged.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that has raised concerns about
potential shortages.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What tools, if any, does the Fed have to ensure that prices and inflation
expectations don’t get out of hand if tariffs do cause significant supply chain disruptions?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I mean, we don’t have, you know, the kind of tools that are good at
dealing with supply chain problems.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t have that at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a—that’s a job for the
Administration and for the private sector more than anything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, what we can do with
our interest rate tool is, we can support—be more or less supportive of demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—
that’d be a very inefficient way to try to fix supply chain problems.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, you know, we don’t
see—we don’t see the inflation yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, of course, reading the same stories and watching the
same data as everybody else.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, right now, we see inflation, you know, kind of
moving sideways at a fairly low level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up on that, President Trump has indicated that he will
likely name a replacement for you when your term as Chair expires next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But your position
on the Board runs through January 2028, I believe.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you consider remaining on the Fed
Board even if you’re no longer Chair?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t have anything for you on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My whole focus is on—
and my colleagues’ focus is all on, you know, trying to navigate this tricky passage we’re in right
now, trying to make the right decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we want to make the best decisions for the
people that we serve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we think about day and night.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is a challenging
situation, and that’s, that’s 100 percent of our focus right now.</del></p>

JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you so much, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger
with Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Public records of your schedule so far this year show no meetings with
President Trump.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Past Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have all met with Fed Chairs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
you met with Trump during his first term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why haven’t you asked for a meeting yet with the
President?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve never asked for a meeting with any President, and I never will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not—I wouldn’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s always
been the other way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So would you want to meet with him if given the
opportunity—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I never—
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>to get more information?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I never—it’s never an initiative that I take.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s always an
initiative—I—you know, I don’t think it’s up to a Fed Chair to seek a meeting with the
President, although maybe some have done so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve never done so, and I can’t imagine myself
doing that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—I think it’s always—comes the other way: A President wants to meet with you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if I could just ask one question on monetary policy,
when it is time to cut rates, how will you determine how far down rates will have to come to try
to keep a balance on the inflation mandate as employment weakens?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I think once you have a direction—a clear direction, you
can make a—we can make a judgment about how fast to move and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s—
really, the harder question is the timing, I think, and when will that become clear?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
fortunately, as I mentioned, we have our policy in a good place, the economy’s in a good place,

and it’s really appropriate, we think, for us to be patient and wait for things to unfold as we get
more clarity about what we should do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks very much.</del></p>
