Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 14, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Price stability is the responsibility of the
Federal Reserve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In particular,
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions
that benefit all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from
credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as
likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that
economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Although growth in consumer
spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting
higher mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be
weighing on business fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Committee participants generally expect subdued

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
growth to continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real
GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of
the longer-run normal growth rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, payroll job gains
averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate moved up but remained low
in May at 3.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has shown signs of
easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>While the jobs-to-workers gap has
declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>FOMC
participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance
over time, easing upward pressures on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median unemployment rate projection in
the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the 12 months ending
in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In May, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation
has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue
to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next
year, and 2.1 percent in 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised
in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation

expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and price—and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage
points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The extent of
these effects remains uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which
monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be
appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But at this meeting,
considering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range
steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary
Page 3 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
and economic and financial developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path
for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario
going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the
appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent
at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For the end of this year, the median
projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I hasten to add, as
always, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the economy does not
evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our
2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Reducing
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum
employment and stable prices over the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I’m curious what
gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time
when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Interest rate–sensitive sectors like
housing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some
regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this
tightening cycle to address that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there
were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of
tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d
need to keep policy restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how
fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then last December,
after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point
hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to
our destination.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold
rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The main
issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may
be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the
ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It may make
sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was
only about this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what
would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about
going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We really
were focused on what to do at this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—
any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean,
of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But really, the focus was, was
on what to do today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been
made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I was just
wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s
been a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower
progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming
from?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not
coming from there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Demand’s not coming down all that fast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>According to GDP—you’ve
doubled your, your estimate of GDP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what’s the—what’s the narrative here?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It seems like
it’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent
with, but on the high side of, expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the
last SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved
up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Unemployment estimates
moved down a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation estimates moved up a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, all three of those kind of
point in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint
will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So although the level, frankly, is, is
pretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected]
federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but so we’ve kind
of gone back to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come
from?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting
inflation down is going to be a gradual one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s going to take some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I think you go
back to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think,
as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You start with goods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>They’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will
say it’s not back to where it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that should enable goods
prices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and you are seeing
there that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s really a matter
of time as that goes through the pipeline.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In fact, I think any forecast that people are making
right now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and
Page 7 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and
that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come
into] effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of
the—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we see only the earliest
signs of disinflation there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say [that,]
in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s the service
sector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And I think many analysts would say that the key to
getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which
we have seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators
suggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We need to see that
continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation
down are, are coming into place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below
trend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would be a labor market that’s loosening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would be goods pipelines getting healthier
and healthier and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There, there—the things are in place that we need to see,
but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, what’s the
value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, not to be
flippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the
gym.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A majority of you
Page 8 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So why not just rip off the
Band-Aid and raise rates today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate
question from the question—from the—from, from that of level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and I think if you
look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our
individual estimates of how far to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far
away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common
sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every
meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if
only slightly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then there are benefits to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that gives us more information to make decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
may try to make better decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as
we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t
really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve
seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll have
some more time to see that unfold.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this
right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that
the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I know you said July is live.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With only one June employment—with
only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July
meeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some
Page 9 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
bank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be
using to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since
the last meeting, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll
really be a three-month period of data that we can look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think that’s a full quarter, and I
think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six-
week period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll look at those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll look at
what’s happening in the financial sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and
we’ll make a decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek, New York
Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down
the path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder, you
know, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient
and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And given that, you know, why do you feel
confident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or do you
think it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this
cycle?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following
the data and also the outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if
not all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s,
it’s just remarkable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s job

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
creation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s wages moving up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting
hiring.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
it’s, it’s really the, the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these
meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s,
that’s how we do it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely
path of the economy is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there’s really no way to know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of
today, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
could wind up back in the same place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it really will be data driven.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I can’t—I can’t tell you
that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate
will be that far in advance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You had said back at
the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that still the
case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, could you give us
an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the—obviously, the current rate,
according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it 5.6?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it 6?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where is
sufficiently restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the
balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero
now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved
much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means
by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under,
Page 11 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
underdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I still think, and my, my colleagues
agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we don’t—we don’t think we’re
there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you look at the—at the full
range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of
progress over the last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you
know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that
inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s what we want to see—
of course that’s what we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are
lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the
tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to
think that some of that may come into effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a
more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you
know, more—with more data over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks
for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering
when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would
expect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to
expect those lags to come into effect?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 12 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s
sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable
lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate
hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting
off—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of
where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where—
where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s
different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very,
very quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But broader demand, and
spending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you
know, then that makes it challenging, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re,
we’re looking at what’s happening in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re having to make these judgments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate
pace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can’t point to
a specific data point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really
flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s
working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we
need to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 13 of 26

RACHEL SIEGEL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing
on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart
from these lag effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what
that might mean.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
you know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what
would normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that
into account on, on—in, in making rate decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s how we think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned that
many of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>housing has come in
pretty low in the past couple of months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation
is now housing prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s
question: Why signal additional rate hikes?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why not simply give it even more time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the
dots, given what we’re seeing recently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a
half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And forecasters, including Fed
forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know,
traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it
over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s running, and it’s running
Page 14 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know,
moving down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We want to see it moving down decisively.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re, you know, of
course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we don’t want to do—we,
we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we just don’t see that
yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by
the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with
which we’re moving.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Quick follow-up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the last press conference you mentioned
you didn’t see wages driving inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there was some research from the San
Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you’ve talked about the
labor market today and the need for softening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how
you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,
but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early
2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People
were still at home.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on
goods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent,
supply chains got all snarled up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So prices went way up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation went way up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that was
the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But as you—as
you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that
it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing
Page 15 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with
2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—
and that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a
few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You said
in the past that you don’t like to surprise markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets
should have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You also said a number of
times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You reiterated that again today and that
we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should
look at your reaction function.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What will you be reacting to—time or data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In other words, if
nothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of
inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you
feel you need to?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal
in inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different
ways data might move.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of
our way to surprise markets or the public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting
the policy right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the
upcoming meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you’ll, you’ll
see the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a—
make a judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down
based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or are we going to be in a
period where we’re not going to know what’s happening?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just
point you to the forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a
little higher than 4½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to
3.9 on a 12-month basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is by the end of this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline
for half a year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s the forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in
our reaction function.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s the
number-one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how I think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Victoria Guida with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you talk about the balance
sheet and how you’re thinking about it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re
approaching reserve scarcity?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also, are you
considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk
about that and then go back to the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on that—of course, we’ve been very
focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The] Treasury has laid out its
borrowing plans publicly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the
Page 17 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid
market disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the
borrowings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills
the, the TGA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP
facility and also in reserves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will
be—which will be greater.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for
that matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over
the course of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make
adjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was there another part of your question?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take
some pressure off banks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility]
doesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s actually been
shrinking here lately.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a
lot over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s—I
think it’s a tool that we have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we want to use it, we can.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are other tools we can—we can use to address money
market issues.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near
term.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Have you seen sufficient
cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For example, how does the recent
rebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place,
really, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by
higher rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We now see housing
putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re watching that situation carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do think we—we will see rents,
rents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I don’t see them
coming up quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level
now, and that’s appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I think we, we look at everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t just look at
housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices
all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely
forecasts—including their rate forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we
cumulate it, and then we publish it for you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how—that’s how they do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself
going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Edward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward
Lawrence with Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I want to go back to comments you made about, in the past,
Page 19 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
about unsustainable fiscal path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in
10 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At what point do
you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Because—assuming monetary
policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level
spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s really not my job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—we hope and expect
that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t see
ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will say, and many of my
predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be
addressed over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would
be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve
financing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Under no circumstances.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So looking at
the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so should we take that as
a sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least
more—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I—I would just say it this way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I continue to think—and
this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent
without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seen in so many past instances.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that,
that gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I, I guess I want to
come back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We, we see—the Committee—
as you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation
down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is our
plan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in
the U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s
workers and families and businesses but also for the future.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Getting price stability back and, and
restored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it really is the bedrock
of the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and you should understand that that is our top priority.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just a quick follow-up on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I’m just a little confused
because you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but
when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate
is lower than where it is now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you help me understand that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with
the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year
out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But what they’re showing is that as inflation
comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually
going up, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out,
let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if—and actually, you know, since
we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be
meaningfully positive and significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So for us to get inflation down, that probably means—
that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is
Page 21 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming down really significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think,
as, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor
do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has not really moved
down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’re
going have to keep at it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Julie.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JULIE CHABANAS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Julie Chabanas, AFP
News Agency.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’
unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you
worried about that—about this rebound?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long-
standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a factor
that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But we do consider that when we’re
thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we do watch that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment,
has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re still
talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half-
century here in the United States.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three-
tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, still, it’s extraordinarily
low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Megan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent
question on housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We haven’t
Page 22 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we did hear Governor Waller talk
about how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or
a shorter bit of relief than we thought.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and
how that played into today’s outcome?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their
increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s part of
the overall picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What you see is—
look at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re just not seeing a lot of
progress—not the kind of progress we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly,
so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be
3.9 percent this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the
course of the year, and that’s doing that again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts
are coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
we’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and,
given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might
need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So wages will continue to increase.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we, you know—what
we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s
Page 23 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all,
all of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not
extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back
down but, but quite gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue
gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of
the income spectrum.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to
2 percent, which benefits everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone
else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you so much, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just
wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s
strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
mean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be
seeking higher wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that come up in your discussions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor
market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s, it’s
very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s half
of our mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we spend a lot of time talking about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, you know, we—there,
there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we don’t spend a lot of time—
although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in
discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we—you know, we, we look,
and we see what’s going on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to
get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as I said, don’t think that was about—I
Page 24 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
didn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is
the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MARK HAMRICK.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we’re about three months
past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with
commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And could you further elevate those risks
with higher still rates, possibly for longer?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m trying to think where to start.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll start with commercial real
estate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a substantial
amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A, a large part of it is in smaller banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take
losses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have
concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re well aware of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re monitoring it carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be
around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you
know, work its way into systemic risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where,
where issues really arose.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the
Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and
in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at
Page 25 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s really
our main focus.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully
monitoring that situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of
things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It might be hard for me to identify
something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re watching
those things very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with
credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able
to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we
can take that into account in our rate setting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I guess that’s what I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can I just follow up on the last part of that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you—do you risk
further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying
as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of
tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because
really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic
purposes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll, we’ll take that into account.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, we have responsibility for financial
stability as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you very much.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 3, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment
briefly on recent developments in the banking sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Conditions in that sector have broadly
improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will
continue to monitor conditions in the sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are committed to learning the right lessons
from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As a first
step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the
Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The review’s findings
underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and
more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>My
colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly
committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Since early last
year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are
also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent
approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will
Page 1 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 0.9 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be
modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Activity in the housing sector
remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates and
slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the first three months of the year, job gains
averaged 345,000 jobs per month.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at
3.5 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming back into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent
months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has sown—
shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But overall, labor
demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the 12 months
ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle
of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting
inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term
inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re continuing to [carry
out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more
than a year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to
our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the strains that emerged in the banking
sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The extent of these effects remains uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have
put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In determining the
extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over
time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags
with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial
developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of
Page 3 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we
are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer
run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a
suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I also
wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March
minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they’re envisioning would look and feel like when
it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A, a decision on a pause was not made today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You will
have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the
Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That sentence is,
is not in, in the statement anymore.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in
Page 4 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation
to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we—that’s a—
that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’ll be
driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’ll approach that question at
the June meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not
my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a
modest rate this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different
forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The] staff produces its
own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the
Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think this is a healthy thing—
that the, the staff is writing down what they really think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re not especially influenced by
what the Governors think, and vice versa.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Governors are not taking what the staff says and
just writing that down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can
have different perspectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I
would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical
in modern-era recessions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible
effects of a debt-limit standoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do
you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what type of situation
would that look like?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:
These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the
Administration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they’re really
consigned to them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling
be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A failure to do that would be unprecedented.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the
consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite
a[d]verse.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll just leave it there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we don’t give advice to either side.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We just would
point out that it—that it’s very important that this be done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the, the other point I’ll make
about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the
potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we—
it’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place
where we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not
paying its bills.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just a follow-up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was discussion around the uncertainty of a
possible standoff—did that affect today’s monetary policy decision at all?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say that it did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was—of course, it’s something that
came up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A
number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say that it was important in
today’s monetary policy decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation
Page 6 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest
rate risks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ve done in the wake of the recent
bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And kind of part 3, but it’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation
principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very
well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I did remember it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
what it was was a general presentation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was an informational briefing of the whole Board—
the entire Board.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think all members were there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it was about interest rate risk in the banks
and, and lots of data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you
know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There
was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it was—I
think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry,
horizontal assessment of, of banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming
situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I
thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many
banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the
events of, of early March, to build liquidity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you asked about the separation principle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—
you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the
financial stability tools are not in conflict.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re both—they’re working well together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve
used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, at the
Page 7 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
same time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment
and price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, I’m sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t mean to be argumentative, but
the, the staff report said, “SVB . . .</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>has significant interest rate risk.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It said, “Interest rate risk
measurement[s] . . .</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>failed” at SVB.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it said, “Banks with large unrealized losses face
significant safety and soundness risks.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why was that not alarming?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was—they’re
pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you
know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They mentioned
that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters
requiring attention.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that was also in the presentation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it was to say: Yes, this is
a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the
case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask—obviously, with the recent
bank turmoil, we’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I was just curious whether you
think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial
stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even
larger.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to
further consolidate banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking
industry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now there
Page 8 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
are 4,000 and change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s going on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I personally have long felt that having small-,
medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the
community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important
purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s healthy to have a, you
know, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that’s a
positive thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First
Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you know,
there’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it was legitimate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think the
FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would assume
that’s what they did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So do you have any concerns about the fact that they’re, they’re
getting larger in general?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the
largest banks doing big acquisitions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is the policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but this is—this is an exception
for a failing bank.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It also
would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the
regional banks bought, bought this company.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that could have been the outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But,
ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost
bid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now to Colby.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the March
meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be
Page 9 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
equal to one or more rate increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, given developments since then, how has your estimate
changed?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite
impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, in principle, that’s the
idea.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit,
and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of
broadly similar way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one
and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, ultimately, we
have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But I
think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have
to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The extent of that is so
hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t
know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s, that’s what
we’ll be watching carefully to find out.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the
Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains
strong then, if, if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as
we want to find ourselves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent
to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by
meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in
Page 10 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the statement, the obvious factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s really all we can do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad
understanding of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Credit tightening is a different thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a lot of
literature on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even
further uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions—
what’s happening with lending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We get—there’s a lot of data on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’ll,
we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, noting that
the statement dropped the reference to “sufficiently” restricted—“restrictive,” I was wondering,
given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact,
sufficiently restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to need data
to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think
we’ve reached that point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March
meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was—
this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to—
before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you
know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I have a follow-up on credit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you give us a sense of
what the SLOOS survey indicated?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were
Page 11 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
tightening credit as of the, the last survey.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What did this one show, and how did that weigh into
your deliberations?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line
with our usual time frame.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you
see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing
from other sources.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls
that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really
since the second half of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Nick.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, the argument
around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was
to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>After the bank failures in March, as
you’ve discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So my question is
why it was necessary to raise interest rates today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of
slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ve, for the last two
meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to
keep moving?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy
we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of
policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over
time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think slowing
down was the right move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do
Page 12 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We always have to balance
the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of
maybe slowing down economic activity too much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we thought that this rate hike, along
with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to
Howard’s question—you’ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently
restrictive stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period
than a six-week intermeeting cycle?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment
will be an ongoing one.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you
can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look, look back.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve seen inflation
come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve seen inflation have
a few months of coming down and then come right back up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think you’re going to want to
see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve
got this right, kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis
points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that policy is tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them
many different ways.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable
estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’ve got 2 percent
real rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would,
would assess as, you know, the neutral rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So policy is tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you see that in interest—
interest-sensitive activities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s
Page 13 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly
even at—that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you very much, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence with
Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections
show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of
3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our
target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a
question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, ultimately,
we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have a, a goal of getting to
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think it’s going to take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How does the other side of the mandate—the jobs side—once
you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at
that point.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You still got
1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, overall, you’re near a
50-year low in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late
Page 14 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last week, and it’s—whenever it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points
above what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we do
see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These are very positive developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well
above our—well above our goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation
down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MATTHEW BOESLER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed
officials’ projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast
as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I’m just wondering if you
could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’re optimistic that a recession can be avoided,
given that that’s the Fed staff’s forecast—possibly also the broader Committee’s forecast as
well—and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters’.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the
Summary of Economic Projections and all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you
said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first-
quarter GDP at that point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Anyway,
in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s, it’s
interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the
unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was
when we started.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So job openings are still very, very high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see—by surveys and much,
Page 15 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
much [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s—it really is
different.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of
the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, that’s what we’ve seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
we—there are no promises in this.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can
continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment
that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, that would be against history.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I
fully appreciate that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That would be against the, the pattern.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But I do think that it—that this, that
the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are
actually—wages have been moving down.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a
good sign—down to a more sustainable level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that—I think it’s still possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—you
know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely
than that of having, having a recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession
is—I don’t rule that out, either.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild
recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still
well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you see that as well?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at a range of wage, wage measures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then
that’s in nominal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases
plus inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation
index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically,
those four and many others.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have
to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They can
Page 16 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deviate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, corporate margins can go up and down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there is a feature of long
expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a
recession—sorry, later in an expansion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, yeah.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The, the—you know, and we calculate those,
and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would say that what
they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer
to where they need to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take
to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—by the way, I don’t want
to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re asking me a very
specific question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there are many things.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I think wages and prices tend to move together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know,
that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you mentioned
profit margins.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And
while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’t
fallen as much as might be expected, given that we’re seeing at least some pullback among
consumer spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a
driver of higher prices?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to
reduced inflation in the coming months?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you
have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or,
or not flexible enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we
Page 17 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation
come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of
full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then it’s—then it’s, then
you’re really back to full competition.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you
tell us something about what your policy reaction function is—your policy framework is going
forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data,
which is, by definition, backward looking?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you going to be forecasting what you think is
going to happen?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I didn’t catch the last part.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rolling?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you
rule that out?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Oh, yes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, I got it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, what are we looking
at?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, the whole idea is
to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re always, always
looking at both.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’ll be readings
on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of
those many things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks
now and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are small and
medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on
lending?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’ll, that’ll be an important thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—
Page 18 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are shrinking the
balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but
perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we have to factor all of that in and, and
make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is
challenging.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What about the idea of rate cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is
going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And in that world, if that forecast
is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If you
have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in,
you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s not
our forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation
moves down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved
much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s quite stable.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to
weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to
begin to see progress there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate
for us to cut rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious how you view the
role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you
think it’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to
Page 19 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
compete with banks for deposits?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of
the facility?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It hasn’t actually
been growing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have
really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits
and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home
Loan Banks and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had
been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits
into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What
was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and
spreading them around and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect
overall on the overnight repo facility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re
supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sarah.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SARAH EWALL-WICE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sarah Ewall-Wice, CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to go back to the debt
ceiling for a moment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just
speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the
markets, and borrowing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be—
we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just—it just
Page 20 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
shouldn’t be a thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the
Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally
from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SCOTT HORSLEY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott Horsley for NPR.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In his report last
week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the
regulatory—or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt
all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift
towards less aggressive oversight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You were here in 2019.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you share that view, and what
would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be
necessary?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the
work, but I do—I have read it, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I find it persuasive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I would say it this
way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly
and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened,
and, and identify what we need to do to address that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some of that is—may, it may just have
been technology evolving.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we have to keep up with all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But some of it may be
our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What our job is now is, identify those
things and implement them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I
feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Evan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 21 of 25

EVAN RYSER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Evan Ryser with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, are we
in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that what the statement is saying?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There were
three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we—
that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those have now all been resolved, and
all the depositors have been protected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic
kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that
period of, of severe stress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with
credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and
you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized
banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s going
to be the macroeconomic effect of that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully
monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our
decisions in an important way, going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Fed Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just
wondered if you’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up
to it over the last—since you’ve been Fed Chairman, I think I’ve heard you say a couple of times
that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you think that was the right way to go
about this?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, yeah, comments on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for
five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ve learned some
Page 22 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
new things as well, and we need to do better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was
unflinching and appropriately so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I welcome it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I agree with and will support those
recommendations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster
measures that will address the problems.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know,
the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Vice Chair, it says, shall
deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding
supervision and regulation of depository institution . . .</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>companies . . . ,</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>and shall oversee the
supervision and regulation of such firms.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for
someone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets
to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Congress wanted
that person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the way it
works—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I give
my, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I have good conversations,
and I try to contribute constructively.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that
person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think
that’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I believe that’s what the law
requires.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an
intelligent discussion about what’s going on and why.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, that’s, that’s my input.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of
Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just wondered if you have any regrets?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or was there anything that, you
know—decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what’s happened?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 23 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve had a few, sure.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, you know, who doesn’t look back and
think that you could have done things differently?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As one of my great mentors used to
always say, “Control the controllable.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn
the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and I think that, that
Vice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Did the possibility of
pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious if
you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again
or what those discussions entailed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across
the board.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the
minutes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But people did talk about pausing,
but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re,
we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you
know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various
channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and we’re going to be looking at
those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the
statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report
or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 24 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just think
we’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think we can
afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ve learned from the banking
crisis—that you would learn the right lessons.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What are those lessons?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which
is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through
history.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in
supervision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought
that was possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite
so quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that, you know, that will play through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I, you know—it will be up to
Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think—I think
that’s one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I guess I would just say that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then, you know—that we’re going to—
obviously, we’re going to revisit [this].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that
we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m, I’m
