Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 22, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Good afternoon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly
address recent developments in the banking sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at
a small number of banks have emerged.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>History has shown that isolated banking problems, if
left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the
banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of
households and businesses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve,
working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S.
economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These actions demonstrate
that all depositors’ savings and the banking system are safe.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With the support of the Treasury,
the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that
hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This
program, along with our long-standing discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual
funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is
available.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will
continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our
tools as needed to keep it safe and sound.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons
from this episode and to work to prevent episodes—events like this from happening again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy: Inflation remains too high, and
the labor market continues to be very tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I understand the hardship that
high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to
our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Without price

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability, the economy does not work for anyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In particular, without price stability, we will
not achieve a sustained period of long—of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 0.9 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some
of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed
investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As shown in our
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4
percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run
normal growth rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the
downside.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Yet the labor market remains extremely tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job gains have picked up in recent months,
with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor force participation
rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>However,
with job vacancies still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available
workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come
into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median
unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and
4.6 percent at the end of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 2 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the 12 months
ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Core PCE—excluding those, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In February, the
12-month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was
5.5 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of
these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median
projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year,
and 2.1 percent in 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way
to go and is likely to be bumpy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¾ to 5 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we are continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger
than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We believe,
Page 3 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter
credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary
policy should respond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate
increases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional
policy firming may be appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess
the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor
market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds
rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.3 percent at the end of 2024, and
3.1 percent at the end of 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These are little changed from our December projections,
reflecting offsetting factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our meeting—
decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the vincoming data and their implications
for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer
run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses
across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How confident is
the Committee that the recent stress that we’ve seen, and you’ve alluded to, is contained at this
point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound
and it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We took powerful actions with [the]
Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the
banking system is safe.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal
review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, just a quick follow-up: I mean, given all the stress and the
uncertainty that you’ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a—was a pause
considered for this meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the
meeting, and you see the decision that we made, which I’ll say a couple things about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First, it
was supported by a very strong consensus, and I’ll be happy to explain why.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, really, it is
that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and,
really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the
Page 5 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December—at the time of the
December meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We are committed to restoring price stability, and all of the evidence says
that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result
in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on
demand, on the labor market, and on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Such a tightening in financial conditions would
work in the same direction as rate tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In principle, as a matter of fact, you can think of it
as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that; of course, it’s not possible to
make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So our decision was to move ahead
with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to
some, some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So going
forward, as I mentioned, in assessing the need for, for further hikes, we’ll be focused as always
on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular, on our assessment of the actual
and expected effects of credit tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate
increases and firming?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without
you increasing rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Really, I would
focus on, on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Ongoing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we
clearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the
uncertainty about what will happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very
Page 6 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
modest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy,
in which case inflation will continue to be strong—in which case, you know, the path will look—
might look different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant
tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary
policy may have less work to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We simply don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you have concerns that the recent—that the hike you did today
could further exacerbate the problem in the banks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused
on macroeconomic outcomes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening
and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think when we think about
the situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular
our lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, in your
testimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Obviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I realize there’s a lot of
uncertainty, but can you—can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your
colleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit
availability because of the stress in the banking sector, or are you waiting to see it in the data
before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we have just come from an FOMC meeting and, you
know, the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I’ll tell you what I
heard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would
Page 7 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
be some, some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as, as
our policies do, and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did
turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So some people did
reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there may also just have been—
remember, this is 12 days ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent
and it’s people—you know, it’s very difficult, there’s so much uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So December was a
good place to start, and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for
December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of
the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that pointed
to higher rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then this, this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions
tightening really, really offset that, effectively.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To follow up: Have you considered at all whether your primary tool,
the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you
believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Have you, for
example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the System Open
Market Account, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don’t accelerate
deposit erosion, for example, from banks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no,
we think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate
hikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Victoria Guida with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask—you, along
with the FDIC and the Treasury—the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to
Page 8 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was just wondering if you could
speak to why that decision was made.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern
that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of
these banks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the
risk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was the
issue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, and then can you also—just to follow up, can you speak to
the role that you will be playing in the Fed’s internal investigation on its supervision and
regulation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And he’s
responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—I realized, you know, right
away that, that there was going to be a need for review.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the question we’re all asking
ourselves over that first weekend was, how did this happen?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so what we did was, early
Monday morning, we sat down and said, “Let’s do this.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And he, he was obviously going to lead
it in his capacity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t—my role was to announce it, and I get briefed on it, but I’m not
involved in, in the work of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider from Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
want to go back to your February press conference.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned the word “disinflation,” I
believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully
under way, or something like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 9 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the
question 12 times, so it’s—maybe it’s a feature, not a bug.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, so, but yeah, absolutely the
same—the story is intact, so it’s really three parts, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Goods inflation has been coming down
now for six months; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it’s certainly
proceeding.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Housing services is, is really a matter of time passing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We continue to see the new
leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s 44 percent of the—of the core
PCE index, where you’ve got a story that’s ongoing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where we didn’t have in February, and we
still don’t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that is, you
know, that’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some
softening in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t see that yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s of course
56 percent of the index.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the story is pretty much the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I will say that the inflation data
that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don’t see
more coming from the credit crunch, because it seems to me that’s something that you’d actually
welcome to a degree and expect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And are you not seeing more coming from that because you
don’t know, or because you just don’t want to have another round of wishful thinking?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a
great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Very large body of literature.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question is, how significant will this
credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s the issue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t really
see it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s
very kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we think it’s, it’s potentially
Page 10 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite real and that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we think about further
rate hikes for us, we’ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder if you could talk a little bit—I know that you’ve
got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think
happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about
regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I wonder, you know,
how can the American people have confidence that there aren’t other weaknesses out there in the
banking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say what, what I think happened, and then I’ll come to the
questions around supervision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed
badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and
interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and
intervened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that the public saw all this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that SVB experienced an
unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is a—this is a very large group of
connected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster
than historical record would suggest.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of
supervision and regulation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How did
this happen is the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What went wrong?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Try to find that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will find that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then
make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again,
and then implement those policies.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my
views on what the answers might be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I simply can’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Vice Chair Barr is
Page 11 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
leading this, and I think he’s testifying next week.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but that will be up to him.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s
really where it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is
clear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and
regulation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I, I
plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And the final point—you know, can we feel confident that these
weaknesses don’t exist elsewhere, given that they got missed at this bank?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through
the banking system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its
percentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And again,
supervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were—
they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that’s really the nature
of the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve
been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them
there for quite some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Following today’s decision, the markets have now priced in one more
increase in May, and then every meeting the rest of this year they’re pricing in rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are
they getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you’re
looking at it, given that you’re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to
ongoing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows
that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and
Page 12 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market, with inflation moving down gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In that most likely case, if
that happens, participants don’t see rate cuts this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They just don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would just say: As
always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens
rather than what we write down in the SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s not our baseline expectation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the
rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is
based on being—it will be sufficiently restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or is it leavened by the idea of you don’t
know what&#39;s going to happen?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In other words, what should people think about in terms of how
the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s going to depend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of
our monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is
there going to be some tightening in credit conditions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then we’re thinking about that as
effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes: It can come from, you know,
from tighter credit conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re looking at, and we, we—it’s highly uncertain how long
the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be, so we’re just
going to have to watch.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In the meantime, you know—obviously, at the end of the day, we will
do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one should doubt that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Rachel Siegel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank
you for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I know we’ve talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was
unique to a certain sector of the economy, but there’s also growing concern that there are
Page 13 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll
over later this year and next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those
loans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of—what we saw with SVB to banks that
disproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in
commercial real estate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I really don’t think it’s comparable to this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The, the banking system is,
is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it’s well capitalized, and I really don’t see that as at all
analogous to this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And one other question: Would you be open to an independent
investigation, separate from the Fed’s probe?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I welcome—it’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent
investigations and outside investigations and all that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we welcome—when a bank fails, there
are investigations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, we welcome that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has been rather sticky, so do you need help from the fiscal side to get
inflation down faster?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t assume that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t give advice to the fiscal authorities,
and we assume that—we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model
along with a million other things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We have responsibility for price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Federal
Reserve has responsibility for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And nothing’s going to change that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So—and we will get
inflation down to 2 percent in time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 14 of 23

EDWARD LAWRENCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if I can follow on that, but they’re working—the
spending that’s happened is working against what you are doing, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s prolonging
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You have to look at, at the impulse from spending because spending
was, of course, tremendously high during the pandemic, and then, as the pandemic programs
rolled off, spending actually came down, so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s
driving inflation right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving
inflation, but that’s not really the story now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Neil Irwin.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Two questions about aspects of
the government’s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First, why is this new
bank funding facility done under emergency 13(3) authority, as opposed to expansion of the
discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that’s been around a long time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, second, can you discuss the Fed’s role in the—in the FDIC guarantee of uninsured
depositors and why there’s $143 billion on your balance sheets last week, supporting that deposit
guarantee?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So 13(3) seemed like the right—we have a little more
flexibility under section 13(3).</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
needed to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 13(3).</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Really
no magic to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s only available in unusual and exigent circumstances, and it has to be—
meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So with the FDIC, we’re just,
we’re lending to the, in effect, we’re—we’re lending to the bridge bank.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s where the
Page 15 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
funds came from, and it’s—it’s a loan that’s 100 percent guaranteed by the FDIC, so there’s no
risk in it for us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, Chris Rugaber.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRIS RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The SEB—SEP
suggests one more rate hike, as does the change in the language in the statement and which
suggests that you’re perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Do you feel, though, that if
inflation remains high, you’ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed, or have you
somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank
you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, absolutely not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, we, if we need to raise hike—raise rates
higher, we will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think for now though we, we—as I’ve mentioned, we see the likelihood of, of
credit tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We know that can have, you know, an effect on the macroeconomy, on
demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that
is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
we’ll be watching all those things, and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight
enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll find ourselves at that place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KYLE CAMPBELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Chair Powell—thanks for taking the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kyle Campbell
with American Banker.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First of all, I’m
curious at what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount
window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing
the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m also curious what your thoughts are on the—not just the availability
Page 16 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you
might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear
about how I’m thinking about these recent developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the recent liquidity provision that
has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different
from what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term
securities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance
of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which
supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The balance sheet expansion is
really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent
tensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do believe that it’s
working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and
thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in
financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the distribution of reserves, we, we don’t see ourselves as, as running into
reserve shortages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to, to run off
predictably, predicatbly and passively is working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And of course we’re, we’re always prepared
to, to change that if that changes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CATARINA SARAIVA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Chair.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
minutes of the January–February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the
possibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on
bank portfolios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion—kind of what was talked
Page 17 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
about in light of that, and then why didn’t the Fed, you know, do anything about that at that point
to ultimately prevent, you know, what happened this month?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
been quite an interesting seven weeks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have
been presentations about, about interest rate risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not
a surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long-
duration securities that have lost value as, as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate
increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s not a surprise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think, as you know, as is now in the public record,
the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and
was escalating but, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that’s really the
purpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to
understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we
need to change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that, the speed of the
run, it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it does kind of suggest that there’s a
need for possible, you know, regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and
regulation need to keep up with what’s, what’s happening in the world.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these
escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have to come back to you on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you very
much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors’ savings in the banking system
are safe.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Shouldn’t Congress
Page 18 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have a say in that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1 billion in assets
failed, are you promising to bail out all of its depositors?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I’m not saying anything more than I’m saying.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but what
I’m saying is you’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of
serious harm to the economy or to—or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those
tools.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think depositors should assume that their—that their deposits are safe.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Greg Robb.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was
wondering if you could give us a little bit more color.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You gave just a little bit of color.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend—you said the question you guys asked
was “How did this happen?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>when you saw Silicon Valley Bank.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I was wondering if you
could go to the Credit Suisse merger.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, wasn’t that the big gorilla in the room?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Aren’t—
didn’t you breathe a sigh of relief when that merger happened?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we—that was really the Swiss government that
we of course were, were following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with
their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It seems
to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been—
the markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that
it might not go well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going
well so far.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nicole.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NICOLE GOODKIND.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nicole Goodkind with CNN
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In the Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC sees the unemployment rate
Page 19 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
increasing to 4.5 percent this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from
snowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand
slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The costs of bringing it
down—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent, but the costs of failing are much
higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank
doesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain
anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to
invest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re looking to avoid that and,
you know, to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century, and
get there as quickly as we can.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I guess the question is, historically, it’s hard to—
historically, it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I, I—the question is, do you worry
about some sort of snowball effect, and how do you factor that into your projections and your
thoughts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear,
and so they’re very hard to model.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the models all work in a kind of linear way—if
you have more of this, you get more of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to
be nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We don’t
know—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on
getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most
benefit the people we serve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong
Page 20 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
labor markets through these long expansions that we’ve had.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Four of the five longest, or three of
the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high-inflation period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or,
you know, an expansion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and
we had several of those, and they’re very good for people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see late in an expansion—you
see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the
wage spectrum.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEAN YUNG.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jean Young with Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just wanted to ask,
with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibility of a soft landing for the
U.S. economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know it’s, it’s too early to say, really, whether these events have
had much of an effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I
guess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
know, the question will be how long this period is sustained.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The longer it’s sustained, then the
greater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so
we’ll just have to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think
that pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just wondering: How many financial institutions have been issued matters
requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 21 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How many?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But those are serious—those are serious
regulatory, in particular immediate attention, and that’s—and I guess there were six of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and getting to the seriousness of it, how are you
going to ensure that banks comply with these citations, take them seriously—how will you
enforce them?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review
will be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what
you think about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What can we do to make sure that—but, again, that’s not for me to answer
today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you have specific thoughts on that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well I, I—see, if I did, I wouldn’t share them because I, I really, you
know, this review is going on, and, you know, I want nothing other than us to find out what
happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s all I want.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed, or partially informed, thoughts,
it, you know, just isn’t appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a real serious review going on with, with people
from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this, you know, to this work,
not connected to this bank, and under, again, Vice Chair Barr’s leadership, and I’m confident
that it will produce a satisfactory result.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, we’ll go to Jennifer for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Curious—how do you view financial conditions right now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If credit becomes
expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’re watching for, would that situation
warrant a rate cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What situation would warrant a rate cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And have the bank failures
Page 22 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we haven’t really talked about changing the balance sheet
implementation—that’s not something we’ve discussed yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, we’re always
willing to change that if we conclude that it’s appropriate, but we’re really not seeing any signs
there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a—
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Curious how you view financial conditions now and, if
credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by
more than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest]
rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we think
that, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there are other measures which, if they’re focused on, you know—bank lending
conditions and things like that—they show some more tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question for us, though,
is, how significant will that be and how, you know—what will be the extent of it and what will
be the duration of it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then—and then, you know, once you have—once you know that,
there’s a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands—how that works
its way into the economy [and] over what period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, you know, we’ll be looking to
see the first part of that—like how serious is this, and does it look like it’s going to be sustained,
and if it is, you know, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would
factor that into our policy decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mentioned with rate cuts, rate cuts are not in our base
case, and, you know, so that’s all I have to say.</strong></em></p>

CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Good afternoon, and welcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>My colleagues and I understand the
hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back
down to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the
stance of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid
tightening so far are yet to be felt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Even so, we have more work to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Without price
stability, the economy does not work for anyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In particular, without price stability, we will
not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We continue to
anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary
policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, we are
continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price
stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have more to
say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this
quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace, in part reflecting tighter
financial conditions over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken,
largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the
unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month
over the last three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past
year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be
out of balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers, and the
labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the 12 months
ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The inflation data received over the past three
months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, while recent
developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that
inflation is on a sustained downward path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s not grounds for complacency.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Although
inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The longer the current bout of high
inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become
entrenched.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 2 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4¾ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we are continuing the
process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4½ percentage points over the past
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds
rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently
restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive
sectors of the economy, particularly housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It will take time, however, for the full effects of
monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of the cumulative tightening of
monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step-down
from last year’s rapid pace of increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the
Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals as we determine the extent of
future increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue
to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and
their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better
alignment with supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to
our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum
Page 3 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
employment and stable prices over the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The historical record cautions strongly
against prematurely loosening policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will stay the course, until the job is done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses
across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you,
and I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for
doing this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields
falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in
January.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that make your job of combating inflation harder?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And could you see lifting rates
higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial
conditions?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect
the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say
that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance,
which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, many things
affect financial conditions—not just our policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we will take into account overall financial
conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.</del></p>

RACHEL SIEGEL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel Siegel
from the Washington Post.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Over the last quarter, we’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages,
and a fall in consumer spending, all while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a
historic low.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would
need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you’re looking for?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have
seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would also say that that
disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What you see is,
really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been
fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
the other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while
but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be
lower.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The issue is that we have a large sector
called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But I
would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Has your—I’m sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go ahead.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go
changed since December?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting,
and we’ll see at that time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now
Page 5 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
getting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but, you know, we’ll
update those forecasts in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You and some of your
colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would
let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We saw the opposite in the
December JOLTS this morning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job openings are actually rising.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That also coincided with
slowdown in wage inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be
studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right about the data, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What we did see—we’ve
seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of
their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The job
openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I did see that it moved
up—back up this morning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do think that it’s probably an important indicator.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The ratio, I
guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you
look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, quits are still at an elevated level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job
market is still very strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby, and then Howard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given the
economic data since the December meeting, is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most
Page 6 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
recent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or does ongoing now mean more
than two rate rises now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the December meeting, we all wrote down our
best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in
December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the March meeting,
we’re going to update those assessments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We did not update them today.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We did, however,
continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently
restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think we’ve covered a
lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say we still think
there’s work to do there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you
know, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March
meeting and then the May meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we come to the view that we
need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would
certainly do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you
know, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of
risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or
going beyond that level?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess I would say it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I continue to think that it’s very
difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually
were close but didn’t get the job done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is a
Page 7 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
very difficult risk to manage, whereas I—of course, we have no incentive and no desire to
overtighten.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But we, you know, if we feel like we’ve gone too far, we can certainly—and
inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know,
the job is not fully done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents
56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we don’t see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not happening yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation in the core services ex.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>housing is still running at 4 percent on a
6- and 12-month basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s not—nothing happening there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the other two sectors
representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is
credible, that’s coming together, although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing
services, but it’s in the pipeline, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that
we’ve really got this.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And how
do we get that done?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they
should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, so far, we don’t see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work
left to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The statement made a number of changes that
seem to be saying things are getting better.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re saying inflation has eased That’s new.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve taken out references to the war in Ukraine that’s causing price increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve taken
out references to the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were
Page 8 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
being driven higher, yet that’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We still
have ongoing increases to come.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m wondering, why is that the case?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And does it have
more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a
very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I would say it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can now say, I think, for the
first time that the disinflationary process has started.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we see it, really, in
goods prices so far.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Goods prices is a big sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—this is what we thought would happen
since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards
services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is a good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is a good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s, you know, around a quarter of
the PCE price index—core PCE price index.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the second sector is housing services, and that’s
driven by very different things.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and
other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but
will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be
soft.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we do assume that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we actually see
disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little
less than half.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is good.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this
is good.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core
goods ex.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>housing—sorry, the core services ex.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>housing sector that I talked about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t see
it yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the
same.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different
subsections.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research
would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be
Page 9 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some of the other ones it’s—the labor market is not going to be important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many
other factors will drive it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In any case, we don’t see disinflation in that sector yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think
we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the
best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re just telling you that
we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we will fairly soon, but we
don’t see it yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest
with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more
persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re just going to
have to—we have to complete the job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, that’s what we’re here for.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Chair Powell, you observed
several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above-target
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high
level despite a historically low unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Given that, and given how much you did
over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why not stop here and
see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and
we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately
restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And why do we think that’s probably necessary?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We think, because inflation is still
running very hot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re
thinking about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way
we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
Page 10 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again, we don’t see it affecting the services sector ex.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>housing yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, I mean, I think our
assessment is that we’re not very far from that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know that, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t
know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by—
you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think policy is
restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
all.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re
going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of
the disinflationary process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this
meeting this week?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three
weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the
path ahead and the state of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all
the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the
path forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given
that we’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U.S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do
whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its
own analysis of any legal constraints?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So your question is, would we—say your question again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 11 of 23

VICTORIA GUIDA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making
payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in
effect, is what—
VICTORIA GUIDA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I feel like I have to say this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s only one way
forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States
government can pay all of its obligations when due.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And any deviations from that path would be
highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the
consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m just
going to leave it at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the
event that that would happen?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just going to leave it at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is a matter that’s to be
resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I gather there
are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not involved in those discussions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re the fiscal agent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna and then Steve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases
and then restarting them?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Lorie Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to
Page 12 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
suggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wonder if that view is broadly
shared on the Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases
in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive
monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s the judgment that we
made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know,
we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, I should have been clearer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, would it be possible to
take a meeting off, for example, and then resume?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, could you, rather than just doing
at every meeting that move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking
about or exploring in any kind of detail.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In principle, though, you know, we used to—the thing
we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was
considered a fast pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think a lot of options are available.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I mean, you saw what the
Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding
right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE
inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent,
and you’ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have
Page 13 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
penciled in for this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And you’ve also achieved it without the 1 percentage point increase in
the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m wondering if you’ve
considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong,
and it’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge
in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair
Lael Brainard, who said, “To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part
for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
other words, it may not be wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get
this sector of inflation under control.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So a couple of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you
take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low
right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from
goods inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be
transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of
something around zero, something like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go
back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s really where the
sustainable level is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s more like at 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that would suggest there’s work left to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We would take that into
account.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a
very diverse sector, six or seven sectors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that—
Page 14 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
subsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the
labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, for example, you know,
financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s why
I said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, clearly, labor is
important for restaurants but so are food prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, transportation services is going
to be driven by fuel prices, for example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you
know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the
labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your
question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can
soften.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down
without the softening in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think most forecasters would say that unemployment
will probably rise a bit from here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to
getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a
significant increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is
quite different.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very
strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior—
you know, in prior business cycles.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the
reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think
will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But I think there is—
there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll have
to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can we get there with 5 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 15 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Certainly possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Absolutely it’s possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s a
question—no one really knows.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s because this is not like the other business cycles in
so many ways.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It may well be that as—yeah, as—that it will take more slowing than we
expect—than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I don’t—that’s not my base case.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>My base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant
downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that’s a possible outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
many, many forecasters would say it’s not the most likely outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would say there’s a
chance of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’d like to pick
up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of
your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there’s still a lot of talk
about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the recession indicators are all
suggesting that we are going to see recession this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I’m wondering if you’ve changed
your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is
going forward and whether you’re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which
calls for more restraint on your part.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own
assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a
subdued pace as it did last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also
final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you know,
most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly
subdued level this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are other factors, though, that need to be considered.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You will
Page 16 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The
labor market remains very, very strong, and that’s job creation, that’s wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As inflation does
come down, sentiment will improve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You also—state and local governments are really flush
these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending
checks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a lot of spending
coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s going to support
economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive
growth this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, Rich.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>RICH MILLER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rich Miller from Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First off, how are you
doing?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said
you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you give us some
idea of what you’re thinking of?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned three months—that we’ve seen three months in
a row.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Governor Waller suggested he might want to see six months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so is it just the
inflation data, or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have
that “substantially more evidence” metric?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped
or anything like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, of
course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment
reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll
be asking ourselves, what are they telling us?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage
Page 17 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
report, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it’s
very complete.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some—was
constructive.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re
still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t
want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s
going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy
over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and
achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not—market
participants have a very different job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a fine job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a great job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In fact, I did that job for
years but in one form or another.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we have to deliver that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we are
strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that
will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Michelle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking
the questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you’ve talked about we had solid job growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business, by the way.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer
spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It seems so far it’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to—from a
9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the hard part yet to come to go from
6.5 to 2?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think we know, honestly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the—so we, of course,
expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all
through ’22.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say these
are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a
Page 18 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what
we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just—it’s unique.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think certainty is just not appropriate here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation—it’s
just harder to forecast inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may come down faster.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may take longer to come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think
we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think
that the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just—it’s the
early stages of disinflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in
disinflation, but that’s great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that
it’s going to take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s all.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do you—how long do you see then, the federal funds rate
remaining at this elevated level?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you
will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a
forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down
steadily but not quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those
expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Of
course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different
thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be
seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>May I ask a further question about the language around “ongoing increases?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That,
of course, implies at least two further rate rises.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the
Page 19 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
implication is that you’ll raise rates one more time and then pause.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you concerned about that
divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is
largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
that’s the bigger part of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts—
different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued
subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we
have inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower
than that this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Markets are past that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll just have to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different
forecast, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if
our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If we do see inflation coming down much more
quickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SCOTT HORSLEY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott Horsley from NPR.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One of the changes in
the statement this month is that the Committee is no longer listing public health as among the
data points you’ll consider in assessing conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What should we make of that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does the
Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the general sense of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look, we understand—I personally
understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in
our economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think
we just—we knew we would take it out at some point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s never a perfect time, but we
Page 20 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
thought that—you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are
handling it better now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t really need to be in a—you know, in the Fed’s monthly, you
know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health
issue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said
recently.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>She said she doesn’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I’m wondering if you agree
with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You don’t see that yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the whole point is, you
know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That means that, effectively, in
people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And once that happens—
that’s what we can’t allow to happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer
we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know,
the more risk of something like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It always
has been more of a risk than anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I’ve seen some data, too, that
show people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>People
really don’t like inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to
economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with
3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical
standards.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why can that be?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It has to be inflation, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think once inflation is seen to be
coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.</del></p>

<p class="removed dovish"><del>So that’s what you’re looking at most closely, is
consumer expectations?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know,
are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of
the process of creating inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a sort of bedrock belief.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In one way or another, it has to
be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think it’s important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so,
longer-term inflation expectations had moved up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We moved quite vigorously last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Expectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer
end.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think, you know, the
markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to
2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That&#39;s immeasurably helpful to the
process of getting inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The fact that people now do generally believe that it will
come down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s a very positive thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the
minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as
important, when the Committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of
financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
haven’t seen—heard you talk much about that today or in the statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I was wondering,
has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you’re concerned about?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would put it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s something that we monitor carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Financial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They

mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s important
that the markets do reflect the tightening that we’re putting in place.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As we’ve discussed a
couple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast
inflation will come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re just going to have to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I’m not going to try to
persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and
some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’ll see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Brendan, for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>BRENDAN PEDERSEN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative
tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster
to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop-dead
deadline this summer?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible
ramifications.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any
important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as
it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the
progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I believe that
that will happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I believe it will happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, of course, will monitor money market
conditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For example, the Treasury General
Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we understand there’ll be lots of
flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re
watching it carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll just be monitoring it.</del></p>
<h2>Common sentences</h2>
<p class="hawkish">Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as
well as measures from financial markets.</p>
<p class="hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</p>
<p class="hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</p>
<p class="neutral">We at the Fed will do
everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</p>
