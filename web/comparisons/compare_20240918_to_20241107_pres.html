Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 7, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state and remains solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent
as of September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting
maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint
by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We continue to be confident that,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor
market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also
decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say about monetary
policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the
second quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in
equipment and intangibles has strengthened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been
weak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.
economy over the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This figure would have
been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment

in October.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families,
businesses, and communities who have been harm—harmed by these devastating storms.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over
the past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has
eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, a broad set of
indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the
pandemic in 2019.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose
2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we’re attentive to the risks to
both sides of our mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range
for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This further
recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor
market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more
neutral stance over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy strain—restraint too quickly could hinder progress on
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic
Page 2 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and
the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy remains strong and inflation is
not sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the
labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than
anticipated, we can move more quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and
uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that our
affect—actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to our discussion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given the expectation that the election outcome will
produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the
Committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the
next one in December?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive
the Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next Administration?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no
effects on our policy decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and
anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to
forecast, looking out past the very near term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Here, we don’t know what the timing and
substance of any policy changes will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We therefore don’t know what the effects on the
economy would be—specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the
achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t—we
don’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, just in principle, it’s possible that
any Administration’s policies or, or policies put in place by Congress could have economic
effects over time—over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
we—along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in
our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Roughly
one year ago when the 10-year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30-year mortgage rates
were near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh
on economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Given that you’ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now
dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today
any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above
your target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would just say this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve watched the, the run-up in bond
rates, and it’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess that, you know, the long-
Page 4 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
run rates are well below that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re watching that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Things have been moving around,
and we’ll see where they settle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s too early to really say where they settle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Ultimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I
certainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I will say,
though, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way
of downside risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what they’re about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we do take financial conditions into account.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If they—if they’re persistent
and if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would say
we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just something that we’re watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
again, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other
factors in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up—is the September SEP—are those rate
projections still valid?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know what?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between
the last set and the next set.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The NIPA
revision was stronger.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October
report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of,
of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the
NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
think we would factor that in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
At the same time, we got one inflation report, which was—it wasn’t terrible, but it was—
it was a little higher than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, really, the question is, is December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you
know, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report,
two more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we
get to December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically
as you try to make that decision?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, as of the Fed’s economic projections in September,
you, you had written down four quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you still think that
those are likely?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if it
shifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of, of detail as to why?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I can’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,
and I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I can’t really speak for kind of
exactly where the—where the Committee is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would just say, for December, we’re going to
be—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that
affects the outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at
5.33 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re, we’re asking
ourselves, “Is that where we need to be?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between
the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too
slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re trying to, to be on a middle
path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress
Page 6 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think that’s where we are, but that’s the question we’re going to be asking in
September and, and in other meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, I can’t really update you on the Committee’s
thinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, total—totally appreciate that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess when it comes to your
own thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a
reasonable outlook?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, I’m going to wait—we’re going to wait and see how things
come in in December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I—it’s just—I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more
neutral stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and that’s very much what we’re on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That has not changed at all since
September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Obviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say
that, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know,
where the Committee would be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wondered if you
could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement
here in the first paragraph when you say, “Inflation has made progress,” dropping the word
“further progress,” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had
“gained greater confidence” that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there
any policy substance behind either of those changes in language?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it—is it meant to open the
door to a December pause?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core
inflation in the last three months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not really, no.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me tell you what we were thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the test
of gaining further confidence was a—was our test for the first rate cut, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we, we met
that test in September, and therefore we take that test out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you leave it in, then it’s new
forward guidance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s brand new forward guidance. “</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What do you mean by it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you—are
you making—are you requiring yet further guidance?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to say “yes” or “no” at every
meeting whether we’ve made further progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The point is we have gained confidence that, that we’re on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, I would tell you, is, is what that’s really all about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s not meant to send
a signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neither of those is meant to send a further signal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, saying “further
progress” it becomes a test where we don’t want to be—we don’t think it’s a good time to be
doing a lot of, of forward guidance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re—there’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that—in what I’ve said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
path that we’re on, we do know what—where the destination is, but we don’t know the right
pace, and we don’t know exactly where the destination is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the—the—the point is to find that,
to find the right pace and the right destination as we go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think there’s a fair amount of
uncertainty about that, and, you know, you don’t want to tie yourself up with, with guidance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher
rates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You didn’t talk about it in terms of
expectations of higher deficits.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in
interest rates, and is that—are rising deficits a concern to you?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we don’t comment on fiscal policy, and, again, I don’t have a lot
more to say on, on what’s driving bond yields.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of, of policy changes, though, let me
give you a sense of how this, this works in the ordinary case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s say Congress is considering a
rewrite of the tax laws; it doesn’t matter what’s in the content.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we would follow that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At a
certain point, we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we’d start to model it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then we’d wait,
and we’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “This
is—these are the likely effects.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy
changes on various parts of the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’d, we’d try to get smart on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then the
law actually passes, and, you know, you’d start to put it—you’d probably run an alternative
simulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then, then when it
actually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, these—we have a very large economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many things are affecting it at any
given time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but—it would go in,
but it would—you know, it’s a process that takes some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Clearly, the legislative process
takes a lot of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, the real question is not the effect of that law.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s all of the
policy changes that are happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the
economy at any given time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that
we go through all the time with every Administration, constantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I just—this will be no
different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, right now, we’re—there’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right
now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s such an early stage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know what the policies are, and once we know what
they are, we won’t—we won’t have a sense of, you know, when they’ll be implemented or, or all
those sorts of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think I would just say—
STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mm-hmm.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 9 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL. —</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>we’re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be
very much regular order when we do do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could just follow up on Nick’s question—are the current rates
something you feel like you need to lean against, in that they go against the direction of policy
by being—adding restriction to the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a
signal that you should do less?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—look, I just think—the first question is, how long will they be
sustained?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you remember the 5 percent 10-year, people were drawing massively important
conclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, it’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that
really matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t know that about these.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we’ve seen so far?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re
watching it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but
right now it’s not a major factor in, in how we’re thinking about things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You
mentioned the positive economic data that we’ve seen since the September meeting, including
the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We saw a stock market jump yesterday.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this—with this
backdrop?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest
economic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But, of
course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with
today’s cut, policy is still restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how
Page 10 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
restrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you look at our goal variables, the labor
market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially
in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further
cooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and
we judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the job’s not
done on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was
appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision
is really another step in that process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an
appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even
as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow up, could you—what might
cause you to pause rate cuts in December?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What kind of economic data would lead you to that
path?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
we’re—so we’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down—our stance down over
time to a more neutral level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to
adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, for
example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more
quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may
turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you—
you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
Page 11 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, you know, it—we’re thinking about it that way, but it’s, it’s something that we’re just
beginning to think about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So with, with this noise in the jobs
reports that we’ve seen and you look at the Fed’s favorite inflation, PCE inflation, overall it’s
2.1 percent—very close to the Fed’s target—but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it’s been that
way since July.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So why doesn’t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting
the 12-month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at all of them, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re
around 2.3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at all of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we expect there to
be bumps.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings
were very, very low—probably unsustainably low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts
generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the other hand, the January
reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
there will literally be a bump up and then down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 12 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say,
“What’s—what is the inflation story now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where is it coming from?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I point to a couple of
things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that—
of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained
2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So they’re back at that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s not is housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let’s talk about housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Housing services is higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s going on there
is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what’s
happening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to
where market, market leases are—market rent leases are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s just a catch-up problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s
not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s, that’s one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary
pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where is it coming from?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not a very tight economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is the story about
inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re
seeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent
with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and
settling around 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data
months, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re
this far into the process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So you’re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you
see, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 13 of 23

CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nothing in the economic data suggests that the Committee has any
need to be in a hurry to get there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We are seeing strong economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are seeing
ongoing strength in the labor market; we’re watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining
strength there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is
carefully, patiently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, that’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we—to the
extent—to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of
that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CRAIG TORRES.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Two questions
today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election
results?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and
I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum-employment side of the
mandate, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One of the
broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Compensation
gains are sliding back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading
down to that bad neighborhood of the 20-teens.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole
saying any “further cooling” is unwelcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is cooling, generally, a little bit further.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So at
what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything
that relates directly or indirectly to the election.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the second one, you’re—you know, this is
the great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll just say a couple things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 14 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, there’s nothing really surprising here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What we know is that the
unemployment rate is low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We also know that it’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up
significantly from a year or so ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sometimes that has meant bad things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So far, it doesn’t appear to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It appears that the—I
wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very
gradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And our policy, of course, is designed to keep
it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further
progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, the, the
openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would—I would characterize it more
broadly as “normalizing.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wages are still running just a bit above where
they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to
remain at this high level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at
these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I would say—in fact, you can
say it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given
current productivity readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high
readings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That
has always been the case for 50 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If
you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set
of productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, overall, it’s a good labor
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We could talk about 20 different data series.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 15 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But, you know, we don’t want the labor market to, to soften much from here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We don’t think we
need that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some of the President-elect’s
advisers have suggested that you should resign.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If he asked you to leave, would you go?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you follow up on is—do you think that legally that you’re not
required to leave?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You talk
a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in terms of
forward-looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials
around the country?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What did you hear today from the regional Bank presidents about what
companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than
looking backwards?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you
think the appropriate policy path should be?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of
discussions we had, and, of course, you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would
say this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the
CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive,
feeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking
about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So they feel like the labor market’s in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People feel good about where the economy is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Demand is obviously pretty strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
you know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Maybe the
year is 2½. This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s actually remarkable how
well the U.S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor
market, inflation coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, you know, really performing better than any of our
global peers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think that is reflected in what you hear from—what I hear people hear from
CEOs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from
those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that, and it’s pretty
constructive overall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, that’s not to say—there are areas of caution and things like that but,
ultimately, overall pretty positive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on
the horizon that you identified as something you’re watching, what would they be?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks
around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the U.S.
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about
those as, you know, something that’s on the horizon all the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, ultimately, if
you look at the U.S. economy, its, its performance has been very good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s what
we hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If anything, people feel next
year—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year.</strong></em></p>

ANDREW ACKERMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just
wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your predecessors Greenspan and
Volcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial—
economic or financial stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Will you do that, too?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, right now, we’re in a period of full
employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have large budget deficits and debt at historic, historic highs that are—and
rising.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that something you’d speak out against?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the
predecessors you mentioned have said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal—federal
government’s fiscal path—fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The level of our debt
relative to the economy is not unsustainable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The path is unsustainable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And,
you know, you’ve got a very large deficit at—you’re at full employment, and that’s expected to
continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So it’s important that we—you know, that that be dealt with.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is ultimately a threat
to the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, I can say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t have oversight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t have oversight over
fiscal policy.</strong></em></p>

follow up on Victoria’s question—do you believe the President has the power to fire or demote

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In response
to Howard’s question, you said it wasn’t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the
economic uncertainties.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not
it includes some of the proposals that the President-elect has put out on the campaign trail—
tariffs, for instance?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at
all, nor will I today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I
mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess I should start by saying
that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very
good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And one risk is that
we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes
back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have to avoid
that risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The other
risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do
unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that says, “Don’t
get behind the curve.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
we’re, we’re in the middle there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage
both of those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor
market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,
enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so there’s—you know, there—
this is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right
path is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 19 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, it’s not as important—the precise timing of these things is not as important as
the overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of
neutral, a more neutral policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its
works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But as we move further, there will be
more uncertainty about where that is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re going to move carefully as, as this goes on so
that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I know you don’t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look
at the breakevens, it, it is clear that longer-term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at
about 2.5 percent, for example, on the five-year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s up half a point from when you cut in
September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you have any concern at all that longer-term inflation expectations are
deanchoring or, put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we, we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw
longer-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not what we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I
looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s
just—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, overall,
expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with
2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow
inflation expectations to drift upward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in
2022 was, was to avoid that.</strong></em></p>

about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans
are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets.</strong></em></p>

on when they might expect relief?</strong></em></p>

performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of
August.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy
restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>This decision reflects our
growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the
labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving
sustainably down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid
pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data
point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth of consumer spending has
remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic
pace last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising
strongly in the first.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the
strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our Summary of Economic
Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median
projection of 2 percent over the next few years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged
116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in
the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage
growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, a broad
set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before
the pandemic in 2019.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year,
four-tenths higher than projected in June.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food
and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation expectations
appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households,
businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median projection
in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat
lower than projected in June.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For much of the past three years,
inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely
tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 2 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply
and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well
anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much
closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation
have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We now see the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the
risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today’s meeting, the
Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to
4¾ percent to 5 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of
the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we
begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At
the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and
employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,
the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
Page 3 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this
year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These median projections are lower than in June,
consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the
changed balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy remains solid and inflation
persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to
respond.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in
pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In July, you said you weren’t necessarily thinking about a 50.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You didn’t want to be
specific, but you said you weren’t thinking about a 50.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The inflation data last week came out a
little firmer than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what
Page 4 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it
shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I guess, should we expect more
50s in the months ahead?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And based on what should we make that call?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter] Let me jump in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
since the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve had the
two employment reports, July and August.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one
that came in during blackout.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not
maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high
and will be revised down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data
collected in] the Beige Book.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we took all of those, and we went into blackout.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we
thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the
people that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s one question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What
was the second and third?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do we make the—sorry, thank you, sir.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do we figure out
in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that
call?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So a couple things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A good place to start is the—is the SEP,
but let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by
meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If you look at
the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from
where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s
more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that process will take
place over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to
Page 5 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
get this done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This, this process evolves over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, that’s a projection.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a
baseline projection.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do
will depend on the way the economy evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can go quicker if that’s appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We can
go slower if that’s appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can pause if that’s appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s, that’s what we are
contemplating.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the
Committee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are
thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRIS RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
projections show that the Fed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their
estimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So does that suggest that you see rates as
restrictive for that entire period?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you
said you’d like to avoid?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little
bit higher?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I
think people write down their estimate, individuals do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think every single person on the
Committee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s
a wide range where that could fall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are model-based
approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any
given time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, realistically, we know it by its works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that leaves us in a place where we’ll
be—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be
looking at the way the economy reacts to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the
question that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We know—if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a
time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Today, unemployment
is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we know that it is time to
recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and
on employment moving to a more sustainable level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the balance of risks are now even.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of
neutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What you have
is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How close was this in terms
of the decision?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was the weight
clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we had a good—a good discussion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, if you go
back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut
and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so there was a lot of
discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there was also
broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would add, though, look at the
SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All 19.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a big change
from June, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Seven of the—seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the
19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you
know, there is a dissent, and there’s a range of views, but there’s actually a lot of common
ground as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 7 of 26

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Follow-up to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now that this is in the books, can you give
us some guidance as sort of a follow-up to Steve on the pacing here?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you expect this to
be running every other meeting once we get into next year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s
no sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We made a good, strong start to this,
and that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down
toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That gives us the ability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can, you know, make a
good, strong start.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—and I’m very pleased that we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To me, the logic of this, both from an
economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think we’re
going to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for
taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the
unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Obviously, historically, when the
unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’t typically
just stop—it continues increasing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the
labor market stabilizing, sort of what’s the mechanism there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what do you see as the risks?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our
intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can say that about the whole
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The U.S. economy is in good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming
down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s what we’re
doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 26

MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry—Nick.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Chair Powell, does today’s
action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data,
or is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate
such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, multiple questions in there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say we don’t think
we’re behind.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of
our commitment not to get behind.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s, it’s a strong move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, your other question was?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between
this meeting and the last meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or is this about the level of the funds rate—the high nominal
level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you’re trying to maintain equilibrium?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that
was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation
and very low unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve waited.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our
confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that is what enables
us to take this, this strong move today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do not think that anyone should look at this and say,
“Oh, this is the new pace.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of
course, what happens will happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP,
you see cuts moving along.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a
more neutral level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given
Page 9 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
developments in the economy and the base case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy can develop in a way that would
cause us to go faster or slower, but that’s what the base case is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you
did the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With a larger cut today, is
there any—should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “end
state” on the balance sheet policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They
haven’t come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As
you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this
at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that these two things can happen side by side.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In a sense, they’re both a form of
normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting
rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just following up
on Jeanna’s question on rising unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Is it your view that this is just a function of a
normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something
more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have
softened too?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not—why should we not expect
a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have
cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level—
the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 10 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So you’re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what’s driving it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Clearly, clearly
payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many—
By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a
very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the labor market bears
close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But ultimately, we think—we believe,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing,
and that will support the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic
activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an
economy that is still growing at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that should also support the labor market over
time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but again, we’re—it bears watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to
happen, wouldn’t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin
to recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising
layoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something
that’s getting ready to happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there
is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when
we begin to see the layoffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s some lore on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s the situation we’re in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have,
in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that
we consider.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions
meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 11 of 26

MICHAEL MCKEE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To follow up on
that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a
higher unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style—
rather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So if—as I
mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the
ability to react to that by, by cutting faster.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate,
though.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to
2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ll be to the labor market,
since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant
amount of monetary easing to just maintain it.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see
further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we have a
dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we
been trying to achieve?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability
without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’re trying to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think you can take today’s action as a sign of our strong
commitment to achieve that goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 12 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks
for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re describing this view that you don’t think you’re behind when it
comes to the job market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be
most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve mentioned a couple, but would you be
able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job
market now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most
important one probably.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re at 4.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we
were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back
over the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Participation
is at high levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for
aging, participation’s at pretty high levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wages are still a bit above what
would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the
very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to
what that sustainable level is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we feel good about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Vacancies over—per unemployed is
back to what is still a very strong level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not as high as it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That number reached two to
one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As measured, it’s now below—it’s around
one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, quits have come
back down to normal levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I could go on and on.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There are many, many employment
indicators.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What do they say?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>They say this is still a solid labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The question isn’t the
level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you
know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the
Page 13 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
downside risks to employment have increased.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and because we have been patient and held
our fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we’re now in a very good
position to manage the risks to both of our goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>RACHEL SIEGEL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what do you expect to learn between now and November that
will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, more data, the usual.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Don’t look for anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll
see another labor report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll see another jobs report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we get a—we might, actually—
we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the
Friday before the meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and inflation data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll get all this data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications
of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and
think, what’s the right thing to do?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of
our goals over time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin with Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve only been
running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you view that
level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be—would you be content if we
were to kind of stick at that level?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the
last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather
than job losses.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor
market cooling will have to come through job losses?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows,
right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating
Page 14 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
100,000 jobs, you’re going to see unemployment go up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it really depends on what’s the trend
underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We understand there’s been quite an
influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed
the unemployment rate to rise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is
something we also watch carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think
everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long
way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment,
job loss.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things
with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that
further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s been—
it’s been a great ride down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor
market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½,
maybe under 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near-
zero federal funds rate, and some think we’re heading in that direction again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s the
likelihood that cheap money is now the norm?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Intuitively, most—many,
many people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were
trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at
Page 15 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
negative rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so—and it
was—people were issuing debt at negative rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It seems that’s so far away now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My own sense
is that we’re not going back to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, you
know, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was
back then.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How high is it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t—I just don’t think we know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—again, we only know it by
its works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will
likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,
and, you know, it’s always the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in
particular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we do that, and
we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s—that’s always what it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
never about anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things
that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, nonetheless, this is
what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, if we
get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this really concentrates the
mind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t put up any other
filters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we just don’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jo Ling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JO LING KENT.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My first
question is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the
American people, with this unusually large rate cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place,
and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>More specifically, the economy is
growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and
the labor market is still in solid shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we
currently see in the U.S. economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll do that by returning rates from their high level,
which has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re,
we’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just have a follow-up to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Listening to you talk about inflation
moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive
victory over inflation and rising prices?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, we’re not.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So inflation, you know—what we say is we want
inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think we’re going
to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re
certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I have
to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CATARINA SARAIVA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just would love
to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we’ve seen in housing
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging
a bit, if I can say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which
Page 17 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’re not rolling over—the leases that are
rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, you know, it’s been
slower than we expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those
lower market rents to get into this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as
market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time
it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As long
as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say it’s—the
rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I
believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services
piece, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with
starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing
market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People don’t want to sell their homes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As rates
come down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many
cases.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean,
the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough
housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so it’s going to be challenging.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places
Page 18 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where people want to live.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and,
you know, where are we going to get the supply?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is not something that the Fed can, can
really fix.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, I
mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and
getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And then
the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Just following up on some of the
labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and
I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too
much comes from the fact that you’re starting to act now and that’s going to give people more
room to run versus just the labor market is strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, also, if I could, following up on
Nick’s question, do you see today’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that
you didn’t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at forecasters or
talk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s no
sense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know,
business people who are actually out there doing business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, you know, I think our
move is timely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as I said, you can—you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a
commitment to make sure that we don’t fall behind.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re really asking about—your second question, you’re asking about July.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I
guess if you ask if we’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We might
Page 19 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t make that decision, but we might well have.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think that’s not—you know,
that doesn’t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let’s look, you know—at
this meeting we’re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report,
the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things
that I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re looking at all of those things, and we’re asking ourselves, what’s the
right—what’s the policy stance we need to move to?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We knew—it’s clear that we—clearly,
literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’s time to move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just how big—how fast
do you go, and what do you think about the paths forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this decision we made today had
broad support on the Committee, and I’ve discussed the path ahead.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Elizabeth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Elizabeth Schulze with ABC
News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>How
much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Very hard for me to say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really
speak to mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our intention,
though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think that it’s time to
begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come
down as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the
economy performs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to
be doing—going to be doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 26

ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What’s your message to households who are frustrated that
home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What do you say to those
households?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had
a burst of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and,
when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy
off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s not something that people experience as
pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And a
good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about
inflation anymore.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just keep it low, keep it stable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re restoring that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what we’re going through now really
restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Price stability benefits everybody
over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I completely—we don’t
tell people how to think about the economy, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, of course, people are [still]
experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we understand that’s painful.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>GREG ROBB.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was wondering
if you could go through—you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was
like an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would sort of
argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President
John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the
day.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, I mean, could you talk—
Page 21 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a
50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was
a really small probability of a 50 point cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that play in your consideration at all?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just talk
a little bit about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for
the economy at that time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’ll do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what we did today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve mentioned how closely you’re watching the labor market, but you also noted
that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward
revisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And given the
SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be
the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,
including the payroll numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not discarding those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, we’ll certainly look at those,
but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There isn’t a bright line.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of
course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move
that would dictate one thing or another.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data
on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our
policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matt Egan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 26

MATT EGAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matt Egan from CNN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I know that you discussed
earlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, in general,
can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed
decisions on interest rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Because that’s something that former President Trump, who
obviously appointed you, has previously suggested.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I know the Fed is designed to be
independent, but why?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So countries that are—democracies around the world,
countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central
banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from
direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe
people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s the idea, is that—
you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get
lower inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not
serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s just maximum
employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s how the other central
banks are set up, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public
and I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KYLE CAMPBELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kyle Campbell for American Banker.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking the
questions, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask
you about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the
changes to the Basel III endgame.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what
those changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you’re looking
Page 23 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then
yesterday, other banking regulators—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know what, hold the second question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll give you the second question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the answer to your question
is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with
my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that
Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, yes, that is—that’s happening
with my support.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there a date for that—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re putting
them out for comment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t
have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea
is that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly
where that is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment,
and then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them,
and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, yesterday.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>there were merger reform finalizations
from the other bank regulators.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair
Barr.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer, for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 24 of 26

JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration
strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even
though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly
balanced.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given what you’ve said, though, today, I’m curious, are you more worried about the
job market and growth than inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are they not roughly balanced?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had a historically tight labor
market, historically tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we
had inflation way above target.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation,
concentrate on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put
in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Part of
bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor
market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what that tells
you is, it’s time to change our stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we did that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The sense of the change in the stance is
that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And today
was—I think we made a good strong start on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it was the right decision, and I think it
should send a signal that we, you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome
here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that
could tip it into recession?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it
this way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a
Page 25 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
recession—sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You see—you see growth at
a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that’s, that’s still at very
solid levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so I don’t really see that, no.</del></p>
