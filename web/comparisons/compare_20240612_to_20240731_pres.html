Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 31, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate
remains low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy
that benefits everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are attentive to
risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after
briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid
pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent
last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment,
government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of underlying demand—
grew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Growth of consumer spending
has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Investment in equipment and
intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the housing sector, investment
stalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Improving supply conditions have
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 25

In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter—a solid pace, but
below that seen in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at
4.1 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged
25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has eased over the past
year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that
conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the
pandemic—strong, but not overheated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our
longer-run goal of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in
June; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose
2.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a
broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from
financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials
like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As
the labor market has cooled and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment

and inflation goals continue to move into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Indeed, we’re attentive to the risks to
both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and
more good data would further strengthen that confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our
decisions meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much
could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At the same time, reducing
policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In
considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will
carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If the economy remains solid and inflation
persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than
anticipated, we are prepared to respond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and
uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our success in
delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that our actions affect
communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in service to our
Page 3 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wonder if
you think that’s a reasonable expectation, and, if so, why not just make the move today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on September, let me say this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we have made no
decisions about future meetings, and that includes the September meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The broad sense of
the Committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to
reduce our policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will
not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The question will be
whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with
rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If that test is met, a
reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you asked, why not today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the
Committee is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our
policy rate but that we’re not quite at that point yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So just to, to follow up on that a bit, if inflation behaves as
you expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the
baseline scenario right now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I would—I would think about it this way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll give an
example of, of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’t be
Page 4 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
appropriate to cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or
less in line with expectations, growth remains, let’s say, reasonably strong, and the labor market
remains, you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a, a rate cut
could be on the table at the September meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If, if inflation were to prove, you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from
inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I
think it’s going to be not just any one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s going to be the inflation data, it’s going to be
the employment data, it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it—it’s going to be the
totality of all of that that would help us make this decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And just to follow up on that—specifically, in what ways
right now, given all you’ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et
cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to
2 percent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think it’s just a question of seeing more good data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have
seen—the last couple of readings have, have certainly added to confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve seen
progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation—that’s goods, nonhousing services,
and housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So it’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at
the beginning of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then we saw some more good inflation data; we had seven months at
the end of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we just want to see more and, and gain confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as I
said, we have—we did gain confidence, and more good data would cause us to, to gain more
confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
COLBY SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The March SEP
pointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at
4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Since we’re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was
projected for the labor market, I’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best
guidepost for policy rather than, let’s say, the shallower one laid out in that June SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, so I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to
depend on the way the economy evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I can’t really give you any, any better forward
guidance on it than that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will do another
one at the September meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would just say, I can—I can imagine a scenario in which there
would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves,
and I wouldn’t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve said what I—what I can
say about September and about today, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, you’ve said
before that you wouldn’t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation
has lagged.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that apply for the labor market, too?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the labor market is back in equilibrium,
why is restrictive policy and, potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate,
warranted right now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is the very reason that we’re thinking about—that we’ve said
in our—in our statement that we’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the
risks are coming back into balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is
an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move, really, from
Page 6 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
overheated conditions to more normal conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We are watching the labor market conditions
quite closely, and that’s what we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we—if we start to see something that looks to be
more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s part of what we’re thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And when you talk about seeing something that’s more than
whatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ve said that stronger growth
wouldn’t, wouldn’t override better news on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder how that cuts the other way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If
you’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change
the calculus on what you’re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have, we have—growth isn’t one of our three.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have two
mandates, as you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market, maximum employment is one, and stable prices is
another.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we weigh—we weigh those two things equally under the law.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When we were far
away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now we’re back, back to a closer to
even focus, so we’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we’re getting what
we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as I said, we’re prepared to respond if we see that it’s—that it’s not what we wanted
to see, which was, you know, a gradual normalization of conditions—if we see more than that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And it wouldn’t be any one statistic, although, of course, the unemployment rate is generally
thought to be, you know, a single—a good single statistic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’d be looking at wages, we’d
be looking at participation, we’d be looking at all the things—surveys, quits, hires, all of those
things—to determine the overall status of the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re looking at it now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I would say, again, I think you’re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions,
and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think inflation
was actually—core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we don’t think—I don’t
Page 7 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary
pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would—I would not like to see a material further cooling in the labor market, and
that’s part of what’s behind our thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other part, of course, is that we have made real
progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we’re—we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite
there yet, but we’re more confident that we’re on a—that we’re on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those two things are working together, and we’re factoring those both into our
policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned not
wanting to see any further cooling in the job market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why not?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or would you consider
preemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that something you
would cut ahead of time for?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t want to see any other cooling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would
be more of a material difference.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If we—if we’d be looking at this and if we see something that
looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have
the intention of responding to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in terms of—I don’t think of it that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think of it as, you
know, we’re actually in a good place here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re balancing these two risks of, you know, go too
soon, and you undermine progress on inflation; wait too long or don’t go fast enough, and, and
you put at risk the recovery.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we have to balance those two things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the nature of
having two mandates, and I think we—this is how we balance them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s a rough balance, but it
does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it’s in a place where it’s just a process of
ongoing normalization; 4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’ll
just have to see what the data show us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, just to follow up quickly: [I] wanted to see what
you thought of the recent JOLTS report, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down
even below 2019 levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Layoffs remain low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it painted a picture of a very static labor
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the
direction we would want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job
openings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today’s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that’s, that’s
a good reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level
continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s exactly the pattern that we
want to be seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I think the data—the data we’ve been seeing in the labor market are
broadly consistent with that normalization process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, we’re closely monitoring to see
whether it starts to show signs that it’s more than that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked
about cutting rates as a process, and, in June, you talked about the idea that, well, one rate cut
wouldn’t do anything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wonder if you can sort of—following up on Colby’s question—talk
about, are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate
cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Talk us through the process that you think—or is it just one rate cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or are you in the
process now of thinking that rates need to be normalized here?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, I can’t really say that, honestly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re—we—
we’ve seen significant movement in the labor market, and, you know, we’re very mindful of this
question of, is it just normalization or is it more?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think it’s just normalization, but we want
to be in a position to, to support the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, we’re seeing progress on
Page 9 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we actually got to this—we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment—sorry, inflation was
over 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was a completely different economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now we’ve made a lot of progress, and
the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid-3s, so it’s a different economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
I think it’s time, it’s coming to be time, to adjust that so that we support this continued process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The thing we’re trying to do is—you know that we have, we’ve had this really significant
decline in inflation, and unemployment has remained low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is a really unusual and
historically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What
we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is—this is part of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We think we don’t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ve
made: 12-month headline at 2½ [percent], core at 2.6.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s way down from where it
was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The job is not done on inflation, but, nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the
restriction in our policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think we’re just—it’s part of a process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of what that looks like, I mean, I think most rate—you would think, in a base
case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’t want to try to give specific
forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think
that’s really going to depend on the economy, and that’s highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we
saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would
you characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 10 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Actually, what we’re seeing now is a little better than what we saw
last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last
year was from goods prices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an
unsustainable rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is a broader disinflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This has goods prices coming down, but it’s
also—we’re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories: nonhousing services and
housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, the thing is, we’ve only—you’ve got one quarter of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We
had seven months of low inflation; you got one quarter of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say the quality of this is,
is higher, and it’s good, but so far, it’s only a quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think, you know, we need to see more
to know that we’re—to have more confidence that we’re on, on a good path down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we’ve been getting good data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
things like the ECI report and, frankly, the softening in the labor market conditions, you know,
give you more confidence that the economy’s not overheating.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t look like an
overheating economy, and it looks like an economy that’s normalizing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if we’re to think about the first couple months of the year, is
there any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate
cuts as were some of the projections going into 2024?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the thing about—if what it is is seasonality, and it could just be—
it’s very, very hard to, you know, to do appropriate seasonal adjustments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If that’s what it is,
then that actually implies that, that other months were underreporting too low inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you
smoothed it out, it’s a zero-sum game.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s why we look at 12 months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at
12 months because that takes all of that out, all those effects out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Twelve-month now is
2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is so much better than where we were even a year
ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a lot better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, the job is not done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I want to stress that, and we’re committed to

getting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress,
and we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more
equally than we did a year ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d like to
ask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>At this point, is the risk greater
to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the
economy in slowing demand and raising prices?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Or is it more important for the American people
that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I—you know, I think that we’ve been given an assignment by
Congress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment
and price stability, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so in our, you know, quasi-constitutional document, the Statement
on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals, and if one of
them is farther away than the other—the two variables, inflation and employment—if one is
farther away from its goal than the other, then you, you concentrate on the one that’s farther
away.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you take account of the time to reach the goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, for the last couple of years, the best service we could do to the American people was
to focus on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But as inflation has come down—and I think the upside risks to inflation
have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now the labor market has softened—you
know, probably the inflation, inflation’s probably a little farther from its target than is
employment, but I think the downside risks to, to the employment mandate are, are real now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
we have to weigh all that, and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive
policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s clearly restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s been the rate we’ve had in place for a full year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the
Page 12 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
time is coming—as other central banks around the world are facing the same question—the time
is coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions, restriction
so that we may address both mandates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday
and another one before you meet again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you certain that you won’t fall behind the curve and
lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHAIR POWELL. “</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Certainty” is not a word that we have in our—in our business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
you know, we get—we get a lot of data between now and September, and it isn’t going to be one
data read or even two.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just—and
then how is that affecting the outlook?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And how is it affecting the balance of risks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
going to be the assessment that we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Of course, we’ll, we’ll all look carefully at the
employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and
the September meeting, and we’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence of Fox
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a,
a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Looking at the
job sides, we’ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve—we’re hearing on
earnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the jobs report from the BLS,
government jobs has been a leading creator.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could the government jobs—as a sector—hiring
mask underlying weakness in the jobs report?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you know, we’ll look at everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen some, some
tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we’ve
Page 13 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
had some months where, where job creation was broader.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, you know, the headline
number of jobs has come down, so—but you look at the whole thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think you do look at
private demand extra carefully, to your point about, about government.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll just be looking
at, at all those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just as a follow then—so could the Fed then be behind the
curve?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Because you said some of the reports—in the last meeting, you said the reports could be
noisy or overstated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was there a discussion of, of—what kind of discussion was there for a cut
today, and could the Fed be “behind the curve”?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve been—you know, we, we had
seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We said we wanted to see more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
said—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first
quarter wasn’t, wasn’t great—inflation data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And now we’ve got another quarter—a quarter that
is good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’re balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too
late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s no guarantee in this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a very difficult judgment call,
but this is—this is how we’re making it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a—you know, we had
a nice conversation about, about this issue today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The overall sense of the Committee, as I
mentioned, is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial
back restriction, but we’re not quite at that point yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to see more good data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
decision was unanimous—all 19 participants supported it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But there was a real discussion back
and forth of what the case would be for, for moving at this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A strong majority supported
Page 14 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
moving—not moving at this meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was the strong sense of the Committee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s a
conversation that we had today, certainly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Courtenay.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>COURTENAY BROWN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When the Fed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and
variable lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder if that applies on the way down, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How are you and the Committee
thinking about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, it does.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the
last six months, by the way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You, you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean, even a
few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look at the labor market
now—you can see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And look at inflation—sorry—rate-sensitive, interest-sensitive spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You really do see now that policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say it’s extremely restrictive, but it’s
certainly effectively restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, there—the lag should, should be on the way down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
should take some time to get into—to get into the full economy, affect financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing, and, ultimately, inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
doesn’t—it’s not instantaneous, although it’s faster than it used to be because markets move now
in anticipation of our moves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long
and variable lags, even when you’re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the Fed to
help stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to worry about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we—just to make it clear, you
know, it’s a very difficult, challenging judgment, and we don’t want to go too soon, and we don’t
want to go too late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s—this is how we made that judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I feel good about where we
Page 15 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re certainly very well positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at
5.3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not
what we’re seeing, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we’re seeing—look at the—look at the first-half growth
numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not signaling a weak economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
also not signaling an overheating economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Labor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate has moved up seven-tenths, and we’re
seeing—we’re seeing normalization there, but wage, wage increases are still at a high level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Unemployment is still at a low level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Layoffs are very low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Initial claims have moved up, but
they’re pretty stable, and they’re historically not high at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So the total scope of the data
suggests a normalizing labor market, and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that
continues to be the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>On the labor market, I was
wondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the
Sahm rule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—so I would just say, the question really is, is one of, are we
worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and the answer is, we’re watching
really carefully for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a—I
would call it a statistical, statistical thing that has happened through history.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A “statistical
regularity” is what I’d call it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not like an economic rule where it’s telling you something
must happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, again, what do we see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What are our eyes telling us?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at—we look at all the
things we’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market—again, job creation at a
Page 16 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
pretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job
vacancies have come down, but they’re still high by historical standards.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, again, I’ve been
through some of the data already, but what we think we’re seeing is, is a normalizing labor
market, and we’re watching carefully to see if it—if it turns out to be more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If it starts to show
signs that it’s more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave
differently this time than it has historically?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That
statement is very true about the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You never assume it’s going to be just the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>An
example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are many, many
examples, so it’s never exactly the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also, let’s remember that this pandemic era has been
one in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve
for starters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, many, many received—pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s
because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the
shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very
strong demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the whole—the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior
inflation or downturns that we’ve seen or business cycles that we’ve seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re having to
learn.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
we don’t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themselves automatically.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Amara.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>AMARA OMEOKWE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the
very recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you take those anecdotes seriously—
Page 17 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that is, that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what’s shown in
the data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s even
greater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with,
with businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their
Districts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I’ll tell you, it’s a pretty—the picture is, is not one of a slowing or, you know, a
really bad economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth
is stronger than other regions, but, overall, it’s—again, look at the aggregate data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The aggregate
data is—particularly PDFP, private domestic final purchases—is 2.6 percent, and that’s a good
indicator of private—of private demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we listen to all of that, and it does, does—I think
it’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Especially, you
know, it’s very hard—GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s just hard to measure
economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are a lot of—it’s just difficult to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I look at both, but I wouldn’t
say that the—that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s more mixed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, thanks for
taking our questions today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You have consistently said that the Fed does not consider politics in
making decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two
months before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so
close to the election is something the central bank knows “they shouldn’t be doing.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s
your response, and do you believe it’s possible to really remain apolitical with a September rate
cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 18 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I absolutely do, and I think it’s—first of all, we haven’t made any
decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say it this way: haven’t made any decision about any future meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t
know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I really
don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do know how we will make that assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what I do know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if you take a step back, the current situation, again, is inflation has come down much
closer to our goal, and that’s happened while unemployment has remained low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re
very tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s at
each of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing
else—doing our part, whatever that part may be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re using our best thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re doing our best to understand the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we follow academics.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We follow the
many commentators who bless us with their commentary [laughter], but we don’t change
anything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all
times, not just some of the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll say this, too: We never use our tools to support or oppose a
political party, a politician, or any political outcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The bottom line is, if we do our very best
to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we get it right, the
economy will be stronger.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’ll have price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People will find jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wages will rise in
real terms.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everyone will benefit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what we believe, and that’s how we will always act.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can tell you this is how we think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on
the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.</strong></em></p>

into account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris

<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If the
data do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you
get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Basically, are there meaningful differences in Committee members’ assessments of how much
more confidence is needed?</strong></em></p>

discussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, so, you know, the way the meeting is set up, the first day
there’s a discussion of financial stability because it’s every other meeting we have that, and then
we have an opportunity to comment on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then we have an economic go-round.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then,
this morning, we have the monetary policy go-round.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think in people’s economic or in
their monetary policy go-round, people express their views about this, and, you know, there’s a
range of views.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People—as you will know from the speeches that they give—people have
different ways of thinking about the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, in the minutes, we’ll lay this out in a
much—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there’s a range of perspectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
Page 21 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you know—but I do think that we are, we’re a consensus-driven organization.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People come
together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This was a unanimous—a unanimous decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, at the end, everyone, everyone
supported the outcome—not just the voters, but everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would also say, some people
examined the possibility, you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but, overwhelmingly,
the sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending
on how the data come in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could
move at the next meeting—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>assuming inflation comes?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, assuming that the totality of the data supports such an
outcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think that the time is, is—
it’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we—that we hope we get, then a reduction in our
policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg earlier this
month, which you probably saw, in which he said, “It might already be too late to fend off a
recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is he wrong?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is the judgment that we have to make, and we’re, we’re well
aware of the judgment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re—as I’ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against
the risk of going too late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we go too soon, we can—we had a lot of advice, you know, to go
ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We said we needed to see
Page 22 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Then we saw some higher inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we’ve
seen the labor market move quite a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as I mentioned, I don’t think it needs to cool off
anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is,
of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s a difficult judgment to make, and what you see is the judgment of the
Committee is that that time is drawing near.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That time could be in September if, if the data
support that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And have the chances of a hard landing increased?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I, I don’t know whether they’ve increased.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think they’re low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
think this is—you don’t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply
weakening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s just not in the data right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What’s in the data right now is an economy
that’s growing at a—at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but, nonetheless,
inflation—sorry, unemployment is low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The data overall show a strong labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
that’s, that’s really what you see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not—it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s kind of what you would want to see, but, of course, the job is never done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
we’re, we’re watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I think we’re—if
we are to respond to weakness, we’re certainly, you know, well equipped to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s
not what we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What we’re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good
labor market and inflation coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GREG ROBB.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you so much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the—in the minutes of the June meeting that
came out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some Fed officials
said maybe the Fed wasn’t as clear enough about its reaction function.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and when I talked to
Page 23 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the commentators who bless you with their comments [laughter], they say that they really don’t
have a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going
forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They don’t have a good sense of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there anything you can say, like how will we
judge that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, I mean, I think the reality is that, that forecasters—and this
isn’t just the Fed by any means—forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the
strength of the economy last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we had to be pretty humble about, about giving
forward guidance about this, that, and the other thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We need to be pretty careful about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, when you’re saying you’re going to be data driven, of course, it’s always what
the data—how they affect the outlook and the balance of risks, but it’s—nobody has great vision
deep into the future.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of a reaction function, that’s a—that’s a long-time discussion that people have
had forever.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think people have understood for a long time, actually, that we were very focused
on bringing down inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nobody was really confused about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The data have, you know—
again, we’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Markets move
around on that—on the data, really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not so much—it’s not really what we’re going to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
more just that the data keep coming in, and markets are very, very responsive to that data right
now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Go to Jeff for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEFF COX.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m going to change gears on you just a little bit
from all of the rate talk and whatnot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year,
there hasn’t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you
could give us an update on where things are with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that considered a dead issue now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it
Page 24 of 25

July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
still something that’s being discussed within the Committee, and what, what’s happening with
that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something that comes up at all with the—in the FOMC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
more broadly, digital finance is an area that’s having—that has really significant implications for
payments generally, instant payments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, it’s something that’s going to really
change the way—it’s going to make more efficient and, hopefully, safer and all those things—
the way payments are made around the world.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we have people who are researching that
and trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as
a convener and as an operator, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of a CBDC, there’s really nothing new going on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s not much going on at
all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not—we don’t have the authority to issue a CB—a retail CBDC that’s available to the
public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not seeking that authority.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what we’re doing is keeping up with—keeping up
with developments there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing,
doing that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re really
not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re really just evaluating, you know, the story and what’s happening out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
think it’s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we
don’t have—on a CBDC, we don’t have any plan to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We would need to go to Congress, and we
have no plan to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not—no one here has decided that we think it’s a good idea yet.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 12, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains
and a low unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to
2.7 percent but is still too high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent
goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say
about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half
of 2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains
solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance
of the U.S. economy over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee
participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median
projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong
but a bit below that seen in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low
at 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25
to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has eased over
the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Overall, a broad set of indicators
suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve
of the pandemic—relatively tight but not overheated.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>FOMC participants expect labor market
strength to continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the
end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The consumer price
index—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE, PCE price index—
rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The
inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly
readings have eased somewhat.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters,
as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE
inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials
Page 2 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As
labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The economic
outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The most
recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there
has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We will need to see more good
data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress that we’ve seen on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or
too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering any
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this
year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But these projections are
Page 3 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As the economy evolves, assessments of the
appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we’re prepared to
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the labor
market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated,
we’re prepared to respond.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that
we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the
balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our success in delivering
on these goals matters to all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that our actions affect communities,
families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in service to our public
mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and
price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Just wondering
if you could walk me through the Committee’s average inflation forecast—core PCE is now
forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year-end.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s already 2.75, and after today’s number, there
were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that tell
Page 4 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and, in fact, that it’s going to
get worse?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you have this wrong, doesn’t it mean that you sort of—you, you could have
wrong the outlook for rates there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in
the second half of last year—June through December, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re now lapping those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
as you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes
in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The new reading gets added to the 12-month window.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s just a, a slight element of
conservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly
PCE and core PCE numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And if
you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the
12-month, you know, reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just
the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we were to get more readings like today’s
reading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s just a forecasting device.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, I
think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But if it comes in—just to follow up—if it comes in the way you
forecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah—no.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we
don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more
confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that
this rules that in or out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month
by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or, or
remain the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that’s, that’s a really good place to
be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, if I look at
the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut—two cuts
this year—fairly evenly split between the two.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I wonder if you could explain a little
more the nuances or the differences there.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Would two or three more inflation readings like the
one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk
to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their
Summary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and
everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a
range of plausible outcomes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”—
you know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re so close for me.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These are
very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as, I think,
you’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or
two.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I
think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one—no one brings
to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular
rate path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their
own reaction function.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I
Page 6 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t hold it with high confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think if you’re looking for—and, and don’t really
think that they’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “this is what I think is the right
thing.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try
to—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think in terms of what
we need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I’m not going to be specific about
how many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s
going to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with
the balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
look at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Have we reached an appropriate level of
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see
really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which
is—which is another thing that could, could happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, again, we don’t see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I—we
do see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that
would warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And if I could quickly follow up—did, did you or any of your
colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation
numbers today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just is, you
know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when
that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—
Page 7 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what we do is, we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We tell
them how to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and some people do; some people don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Most, most people don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, you
know—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can,
you know, reflect it in one day.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll
know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the initial CPI reading
and its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jonnelle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JONNELLE MARTE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you
noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So do you think that there
still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent,
or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that
many of those imbalances have eased?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind
of overheated two years ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance
between supply and demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, what have we seen?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen labor force supply come up
quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s ongoing, mostly
now through the immigration channel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor
force.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving
down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve seen job openings moving down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen wage increases moving from very,
Page 8 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
very high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We have seen
unemployment creep up now sixth-tenths over the course of, of a year or so very, very gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent
unemployment—historically low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and,
you know, that’s an important statistic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument
that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what we
see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor
market very carefully—and that’s what we see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see gradual cooling—gradual moving
toward better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that,
but we really don’t see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As a quick follow-up—the surveys that make up the jobs report
are, are showing different tales.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s been some divergence, especially, we saw, in the last
report that we got on Friday.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So how do you interpret that, and, and how does it change your
view on the labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You just
have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s why it always makes
sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one
report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the
household survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I mean, we’re left
with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, the
overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of
Page 9 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployed people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The jobs–workers gap is still a significantly positive number—greater than
it was before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, overall, we’re looking at what is still a very strong labor market
but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin, with Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Back on the rates path:
The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March—that’s a period in
which the economic data flow hasn’t been that dramatic a shift.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How, how—can you provide
some color on what changed in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to, to
see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So the
inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, as I mentioned
earlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We had really, really good
inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the
confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might
take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we—there
are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so you
really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would
have been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, you get another—you
get data—different data today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll have to see where the data light the way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
we’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,
and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll just
Page 10 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have to see what, what—what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the
outlook and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the Summary of Economic Projections, the long-run interest rate forecast moved
up a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as
restrictive as we’ve previously expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, how should we interpret what that means
about how the Committee views its current policy setting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move
up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a
long-run concept.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And what it is
is the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and
price stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s—
it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today we’ve got a very specific economy
with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s—I, I don’t think that
the, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But,
honestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is
in the near term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because
I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their,
their pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now,
we, we can’t really know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,
but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving
Page 11 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
forces.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there’s a really good question about whether, whether those really have
changed or whether, instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a, a series of persistent but,
ultimately, temporary shocks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s been the debate, and we can’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in the meantime,
we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I
also—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of
“How restrictive is policy?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question of whether it’s
sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think for the reasons I’ve
talked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear
that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider, with Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Just
to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of
tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to
market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you
weren’t quite there yet?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think this is about,
you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on
inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Is the labor market still strong?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
what we’re thinking about.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language
you’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability,
and another goal, which is maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How are we doing there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think we’ve
got a good, strong labor market still.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think we’ve been making progress toward the price-
Page 12 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then for a while, there was a pause.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we look at today’s thing, and we
think, “Well, that’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, in the
meantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think we think, “Yes, it’s
about right.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting
the things that we would want to get, broadly speaking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s why we’ve been at this
policy rate now for almost a year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so just to follow up on that—I think one, one curious
thing here is, you’ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the
major things for all of this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got growth that stays above long-run potential
throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long-run estimate—
right?—of 4.2.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So this isn’t a story of slack improving inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So where’s the improvement in
inflation coming from that it’s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from—
let’s start with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just
the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and
demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by
restrictive monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those two things have been working together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve also had a
very positive supply shock on the labor side.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply
shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’ve had, you
know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of
inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest
of this year brinks—brings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I mean,
ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and we don’t know that,
Page 13 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, look at today’s report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, if we see more like that—you know, we
don’t—we can’t know what the future holds.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in the meantime, we’ve made pretty good
progress on inflation with our current stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The base
case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but
your growth forecast doesn’t see any slowdown in the rest of the year, nor does the
unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And your inflation
forecasts basically average out to no change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if, at the end of the year, there is no change
from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What, what would be the point
for a rate cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think,
ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real
weakening in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise
rates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not to eliminate the
possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the
Committee does.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what
we’ve been getting.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at
a—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, ultimately, we think rates will have
to come down to continue to support that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, so far, they haven’t had to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know,
that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t really see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We kind
of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the
Page 14 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
labor market while we’re continuing to make progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re getting—we’re
getting good results here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, to follow up: Is there any kind of concern for the housing
industry or financial stability—banks—in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean,
ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we
can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There will still be a
national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There will still be one, but the
distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in
terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had the turmoil earlier
last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up
their capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the banking system, you
know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I was
wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see
inflationary pressure in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance,
and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’re seeing, you know, anecdotal
stories of, the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald’s
announcing a $5 meal deal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but
Page 15 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy—and wonder if you
could tell us more about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have
come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know—and I
think you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on
goods, which is kind of hard to understand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some
signal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re seeing—you’re
continuing to see high readings there to some extent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation
from earlier pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, I mean, overall, you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflationary pressures have come
down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages are still running,
you know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and
trend productivity.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we haven’t
thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But at the same time,
getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which
is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>There’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected
this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do
to the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end
of the year or even two?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think if, you know—if you look back in 5 or 10 years and, and try
to pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of one 25 basis point rate cut, you’d, you’d have
quite a job on your hands.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s not how we look at it—you know, really, the whole rate
path matters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen
policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the
market will price in what it prices in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t—I have no way of saying—we’re, we’re not at that
stage, so I don’t know what we’ll be thinking about at that time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s a consequential
decision for the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we, we have the ability to, you know, approach this
question carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we will approach it carefully while we’re very much keeping an eye on,
you know, downside economic risks, should they—should they emerge.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’ve been talking about this clear sense that it’s just going to
take longer to have the confidence that’s needed for rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there something about what
happened in the first couple of months of the year that you’re seeing differently now with more
time or hindsight?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting
that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the
parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So—but we had a
quarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we
shouldn’t have taken signal from.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it is what it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, you, you have to—you know,
low inflation is low inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to
take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the
signal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that
Page 17 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s what we said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that was
the right thing to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I still think that’s the right thing to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Now we have today’s inflation
reading, which is very different—very much more positive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to have to see what the
trend is—what’s, what’s going to be the data going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re looking for something that
gives us confidence that inflation is, is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And readings like
today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it
just—it’s only one reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any
single data point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m Jo Ling
Kent, with CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging
economic data but don’t feel good about this economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, you know—I, I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer
why people are, are not as happy about the economy as they might be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t tell people
how they should think or feel about the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not our job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—you know, people
experience what they experience.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is,
we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve got a very strong labor market with
unemployment at 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of
time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had a period of high
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can
to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re confident that we’ll get there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful
for, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high
Page 18 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is people who—lower-income people—people who are at the margins of the
economy who, who have the worst experience—who experience the most pain from inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that
we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As just a quick follow-up here—you’ve indicated one interest rate cut
sometime this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I know you don’t have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are
watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For everybody who’s
out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But what we
said is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back
down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So having that kind
of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,
to all Americans, for a long period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had that period for a very long time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We very
much want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a
concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We were there for a long time, and
our goal is to get back to that place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in
the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Claire.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CLAIRE JONES.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just drawing on the change in the
statement on there being “modest further progress” on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, halfway, you know,
through the year and after today’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee
members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just in terms of the
Page 19 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth,
clearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see
still-strong growth—solid growth this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s been very encouraging.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If you go back a
year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a
recession—many forecasters had that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s not what happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Instead, we—the U.S. is,
anyway, and it’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the
world.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s been encouraging.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say that the, the—today’s inflation report is
encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You asked about—your second question was really about shelter inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think if
you go back a couple of years—we, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you
know, people who own their houses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we have OER, which is owners’ equivalent rent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the—of the—when the
economy reopened, they really went up sharply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those play into rollover rents much more
slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and so what we—so we, we’ve
found now that there are big lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in,
in market rents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has to get worked off, and that may take, you know, several years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain—are going at—up at relatively low levels—and
they still are—you know, this, this is just going to happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It just is going to happen more slowly
than we thought.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to, to owned
homes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—you know, many countries around the world do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some do it differently
Page 20 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
than us.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s something that the—you know, that the, the price experts have regularly looked at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is not something that we’re the only country that does, and it’s not something we’re looking at
changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it—it’s true.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s one of the
very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services
that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they’re actually living in it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And some countries—you should just ignore that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But that’s not our—that’s not how we do
inflation here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we do it the way we do it, and we’ve been very transparent about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
you know, it’s true that we’re—we’re seeing delays in, in realizing what—what’s happening
economically.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we understand that—you know, we understand that very well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking
the question, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The last jobs report
showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s up 8.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And since January of 2021, we’ve seen prices rise 19 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So people are using their credit
cards to pay for their lifestyle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy
could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income
during big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is
people spending more on their credit cards.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That—that has been happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Credit card
balances have been going up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Credit card defaults have been going up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re not at high
levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They couldn’t spend money.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But households
Page 21 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
were in very, very strong—historically strong—financial shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’ve now worked off a lot
of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, we’re watching that carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, what do we see?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what
we see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household
sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of
shape it was in a year or two ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So how close then are we to that point where the consumer
can’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can’t hire like they’re hiring?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So consumer spending is still growing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s not growing at the pace it
was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, by the way,
other parts of the economy are picking up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has
picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—
you know, tech plants.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know—
something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for
the U.S. economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, no, you’re, you’re right, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we do see the same thing other
people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower-income
people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is, is to foster a very strong jobs economy,
which we think we have done—ultimately to get inflation under control, because those people
experience inflation, you know, very directly—very painfully.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and, you know, once, once
we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which, which will also improve things.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’ve mentioned that
unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I was just
wondering—can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it more of, like, a
Page 22 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quicker pace of people losing jobs?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to
start to go above 4.2 or something like that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How are you thinking about what you’re looking
for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is
more than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’ll be looking at everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the
ability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So waiting for that to happen is,
is not what we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance
of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all
of it—the whole situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy
could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I, you know, I would just—
you know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And if we saw troubling—weakening
more than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
we’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So something like negative payroll numbers would be—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not going to—yeah, I mean, I, I can think of things that would—
many things would make it on that list, but I don’t think I’ll, I’ll utter them here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>May I ask—you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE [inflation] readings earlier
this year, that it wasn’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more
cautious in the rate outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be
quite good for PCE [inflation], as it was for CPI—does that imply that kind of two more good
Page 23 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
months would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently
project?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I, I don’t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in,
in my thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I get that, you know—as many good ones as we had bad ones—but it’s not
like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s the whole.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s going to be the totality of the data—[including] labor market data,
the growth data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that
builds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I don’t want
to try to give you specific numbers of things, because that points to dates, and I, I just don’t
think—we’re not at a point of being able to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kosuke.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KOSUKE TAKAMI.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for doing this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I am Kosuke Takami, with Nikkei.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in—Japan and some
emerging markets are suffering from the strong dollar.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I want to know if it is having a
positive impact on U.S. economy in total?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the
Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing
things about the level of the dollar.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So for us, it’s just another financial variable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’re
right—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last
year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t think of it as benefiting or hurting
the U.S. We don’t—again, we don’t manage the level of the dollar.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s not our—
that’s not our job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know—and for, for our economy, what, you know, we’re trying
Page 24 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to foster is maximum employment and price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we feel like we’ve made good
progress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger, with
Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re
forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re at 2.8 percent, of course,
on core PCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to
2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You also indicated the
job market has mostly normalized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So why not cut rates this summer just once—you’re well
above neutral—to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest
for confidence for inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks
here, let me just say.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of
economic activity, of employment, of the expansion.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We understand that if we move too, too
quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over,
and it could be very disruptive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and
just basically trying to manage them.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t
think it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is
moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s—that’s kind of been our test.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s our—that’s our
dual mandate there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we, we have a strong economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve got growth—all
forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our
Page 25 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Unemployment is still
low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully, and that’s, that’s what
we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to follow, Chair Powell—do you need to be
ahead of a weakening in the labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Otherwise, is it too late, given that the labor market is
a lagging indicator—right?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s,
that’s not what we’re—that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework,
and we think we’re doing that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>EVAN RYSER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Evan Ryser with Market News International.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Who will lead it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Will
you be—will it be you or a member—a Committee group of your—of your peers?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What will be
the parameters?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going
forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we—what, what we’ve been thinking is that we would announce
and commence the review later or late in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the meantime, as that time approaches, we
will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Within scope would
certainly be communications generally.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that
particular thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get
Page 26 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prematurely into a conversation until it’s really time to have it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, you know, I’m going to
leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go to Nancy, for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer, with
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just one more question on housing—can you still cut rates with shelter prices high,
or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable, like housing

<p class="neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on

the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.</p>
