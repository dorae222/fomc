Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 1, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Welcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>My colleagues and I remain
squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for
the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that
tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full
effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given how far we have come,
along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will
make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain
restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and
well above earlier expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an
outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>After picking up
somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Higher interest rates also
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the
supply of workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic
levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined
so far this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the
supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has moderated since the middle of last
year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But a few months of good data are
only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down
sustainably toward our goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a
long way to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain
well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecastters, as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
Page 2 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our restrictive
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are
confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand
for labor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is
no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further
tightening of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher
longer-term bond yields, among other factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Because persistent changes in financial conditions
can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments
closely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is
proceeding carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation as well as the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In determining the extent of additional policy firming
Page 3 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring
price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices
over the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chair Powell,
for doing this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To what—you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields—to what degree did
that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for your question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want
to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, if
you—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has been coming
down, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market has been
rebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>GDP growth has been strong, although
many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
As for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that’s
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we’re not confident yet
that we have achieved such a stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that is the broader context into which this, this strong
economy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of
rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields
and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the
path of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming]
from higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower
equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that is something
that remains to be seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s critical.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not
what we’re looking for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are
material.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t
simply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we
didn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and I would say on
that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the
increase in longer-term rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is
that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households
and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this
tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,
Page 5 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
which could have pretty significant effect on housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how I would answer your
question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this: In your opening
statement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions
are restrictive enough to finish the fight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that true?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s exactly right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, to say it a different way: We
haven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have not made a determination,
and we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—that is—the
way we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the
extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to
2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you so much for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I
wonder, you know, if you don’t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at
that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting
rate increases next year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about
September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re asking a hypothetical there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll
get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on
economic activity, and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation, the broader financial
condition situation and broader world situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be looking at all those things as we make
a decision in December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We haven’t made that decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I would say, though, that, that the idea that if you—the idea that would—difficult to raise
again after stopping for a meeting or two, it’s just not right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, the Committee will always
do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about—
at all about December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December
today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, did the Fed
staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today’s meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening
is persistent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the
spring.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is it here on something that’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar
to simulate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the
recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the answer is “no.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the
minutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity
we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be
doing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can see
how volatile it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an
estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very
quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you
can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And over time, that will have an effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just don’t know how persistent it’s going to be, and
it’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I’d be comfortable communicating into how many
rate hikes that is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident—what
makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above-trend growth when
500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and
sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you
raise interest rates, you do see those effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you see those effects in the economy now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see what’s happening in the housing market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re seeing that now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ll see, if you
look at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds
because rates are so high now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the
effects of this—of this could be quite significant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This has been a resilient
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there are a number of possible
reasons why that may be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,
and so we take the economy as it comes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>COLBY SMTH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the
thresholds that you’ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence
of persistently above-trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market
tightness—that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike
would be necessary.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m just curious if that’s how the Committee sees it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ve identified those factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those were not meant to be the
only factors or a specific test that we’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Really, we’re going to be looking at the broader picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, what’s happening with our
progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Is the labor market continuing to, broadly, cool off
and achieve a better balance?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be looking at that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, growth—we look at growth
insofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at that, and we look at broader
financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you
know, whether we need to further tighten policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, if we do reach that judgment, then we
will further tighten policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if
that is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates,
what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could we see those maybe pulled
forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts
right now at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not talking about rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re still very focused on the first question,
which is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is the question we’re focusing on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Will policy remain
restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident
that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’ll be the next question, but
honestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question of rate cuts
just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you
know, as close to right as you can.</strong></em></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that
there was a tightening bias in the Committee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You say in the statement you’re looking to assess
the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There were forecasts for two rate
hikes among most members of the Committee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But then you just said that, you know, we
don’t—we haven’t made a determination.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there
is no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for
two hikes?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, one additional—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say that at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say—I mean, the language,
looking at it here, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate
to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the question we’re asking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the Committee
here?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question
we’re asking is, should we hike more?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and
you’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know—and
we’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRIS RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, since the last
meeting, the auto workers’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet, on the other
hand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you see all those factors,
taken together, affecting the economy going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How are you thinking about those?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 10 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, there are significant issues out there, as you point out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Global
geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that goes for the war in Ukraine; it goes for the
war between Israel and Hamas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re monitoring that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our job is to monitor those things for
their economic implications.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to
an end.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Oil prices have flattened out; they haven’t gone down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess they’ve gone down a
little bit from their earlier peak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we
don’t know about that one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s plenty of risk out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would go back to—the
bigger picture from our standpoint is, we’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market,
making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re very focused on
getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently
restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s really our focus.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just one quick thing: You, last month, had gone to
York, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of—or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot
of small business owners.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you
pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of
what they talked about?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was very impressed by
York as a town with a real strategy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there
have put together in the face of, you know, some difficult longer-run trends about offshoring of
manufacturing and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’ve done a great job as a city, I think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know,
what you hear—and it’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You were there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We talked to some people who, you know, were feeling that in their
businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s
Page 11 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
painful for people—particularly people who don’t have a lot of extra financial resources who are
spending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That wasn’t new.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in
York, and, you know, I walked away from that even—you know, I mean, just thinking that we
really—the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability—fully restore price
stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage
we can.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for
the economy in order to get inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But since the economy has not responded to rate
hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all—on
how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall
growth?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been
able to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the same is true of growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And growth has been
strong, but yet we’re still seeing this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I
think still believe, that is likely to be true.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely
that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor
market conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but it’s only a good
Page 12 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
thing that we haven’t seen it, and I think we know why.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, since, since we lifted off,
we, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One of them—one of
which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the
pandemic and the response to the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary
policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space
to recover.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But it’s
that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower
growth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and
bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in
the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of
why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, we welcome that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think,
and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Against that backdrop, if you’ve gotten any clarity on lags—if you
have an economy that’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that
there isn’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that&#39;s still coming through the pipeline and
that it may have already come into effect?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s been one
year at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s a
full year since then.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this
year—we’re seeing it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you can, for
Page 13 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
example—an example where you wouldn’t have felt this yet is, is debt that had been termed out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and there
are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags
are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is
really not a good way to do it.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process
down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it takes time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know that, and you can’t rush it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better
sense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m
trying to connect the dots here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel’s question
is, you said you need slower growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You had always said before a period of lower-than-trend
growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Has that changed?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, two, it sounds to me like you’re basically saying here that kind
of the dot plot’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase
for right now—doesn’t matter about the turn of the year—and that there’s not an objective way
to determine whether or not you’ve got enough tightening in the system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just going to be a
subjective judgment, meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the dot plot is a picture
in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in
light of their own personal economic forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s
not, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a forecast that would
change, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I
Page 14 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wouldn’t write down that dot six weeks later.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Think of the number of things that could change
your mind on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three-month
period between that meeting and the next meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, nonetheless, it’s out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t—
we do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, I
think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be—
my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was
“below potential.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily—
potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the right way to
think about it is, what’s potential growth this year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People think trend growth over a long period
of time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what we’ve
had is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned,
through both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning
in the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and
shortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>There’s
catch-up growth that can happen in potential.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that means that if you’re growing—you could
be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output
of the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I hope that’s clear.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s really what’s going on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s why I would say it as
below potential.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by
meeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting
Page 15 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at
each meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s
characterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, we’re going meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive
to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re looking
at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we
look at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking
cycle, very far.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a
relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re close to the—to
the end of the cycle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not a
promise or a plan of the future.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’re going into these meetings one by one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re
looking at the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re proceeding
carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Monetary policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see
its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how I think
about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In light of the run-up
in long-term yields we’ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the
pace of your asset runoff program?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if there were judgment that higher—that the higher-
term premium was endangering the dual-mandate goals, would that be reason to think about
slowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around
reserves?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance
sheet runoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something we’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many
candidate explanations for why rates have been going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And QT is certainly on that list.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it’s
not—I think—I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s not something that we’re—that we’re looking at right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Victoria Guida with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask about the Basel
III Endgame capital proposal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve gotten a lot of “pushback” from people on different
aspects of the proposal, and you yourself expressed some reservations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m just curious:
Could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, that proposal is out for comment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we expect a lot of
comment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
we’ve extended the deadline.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll take them seriously.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll read them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll say what,
what I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It means broad support.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jonnelle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JONNELLE MARTE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in addition to persistence,
when you look at long-term Treasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those
tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further
tightening?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 17 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what do we look at?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at a very wide range of financial
conditions and, in fact, as you’ll know, different organizations publish different financial
conditions’ indexes, which can have, you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables,
so there’s a very rich environment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we tend to look at a few of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not going to give
you the names, but, you know, they’re a few of the common ones that people look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
they’re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates,
the credit spreads.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sometimes they’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn’t
any one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We would never look at, for example, long-term Treasury rates in isolation, nor
would we ignore them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play
a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your second
question was?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the banking stress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you know,
we, we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in
the March—the things we went through in March and thereafter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’ve been working a
lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that
they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we do think the banking system is quite resilient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had, you know, a handful of bank
failures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t have any reason to think
that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong
banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,
on funding, and those sorts of things.</strong></em></p>

SCOTT HORSLEY.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Scott Horsley from NPR.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Last week you
and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for
comment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there—what it would mean for
merchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of
both debit and credit cards in the—in the payment system?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, so you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We put a proposal out for comment, is
what we did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in
Dodd-Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s all we’re
trying to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What else can we really do?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t
comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we do hope that
stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They
haven’t been shy about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that
now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So for the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core
well over 3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but
with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus
overall inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and
be bumpy, but we’re making progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came
down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the best thing I could point you to would
be the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of
Page 19 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year, on a 12-month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further
into the 2s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s—if you look historically, that’s, that’s sort of consistent with the
way inflation comes down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get
further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the good news is, you
know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we feel like we’re on a
path to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you’ve said in the past that doing too little on interest
rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How robust
was the debate about this pause on the doing-too-little side?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And we know
that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get
entrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation will be both
more—both higher and more volatile.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so
we’re really committed to not letting that happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, for the first year or so of our
tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, you know, we’re—
we’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can’t
identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Quick follow-up
to the question about banking stresses—you talked about how the banking system is resilient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of
course, part of the resilience the past year stems from the Bank Term Funding Program that you
launched in March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are
Page 20 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
probably mounting, how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next
year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Good question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking
about that yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the
first quarter of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Quick second question about inflation
expectations—the U. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one-year-ahead inflation
expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Last year you said that particular survey was a really
decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If it stays elevated next time around, how big
of an input will that be into your December thinking?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at a range of, of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the, the, the, you
know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was actually a preliminary
estimate that got revised away.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at many, many things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also
market-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between
meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it will—
they’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can always find one
reading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the
public believes that inflation will come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical
in winning the battle.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for
taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned
today that you’re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, and you’ve recently said
that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I was curious if you could
elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view, has risen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So first thing to say is that it’s very important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a very
important variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with
any precision in real time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you have to just take that—you have to take
your estimate of it with a grain of salt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What we know now is, you know, within a range of
estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on
economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we do—we do talk about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s not any
debate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or
not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Ultimately, it’s
unknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and
giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our
moves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down
to 2 percent over time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the question we’re asking ourselves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, you know, years
from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to look—we have to have
those models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the
effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 22 of 27

MEGAN CASSELLA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up on a wages point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Earlier you talked about
the inflation outlook, but I’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its
current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have—
wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a
level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent
inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s much
closer than it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this
week.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and all of them
are kind of saying that, which is great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you have to look at a group of them because any one
of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what you see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so what
you saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if
you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down
substantially in June.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the
June reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our
expectations internally, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we feel good about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also I would say it isn’t—in my
thinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far,
although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy
becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of
the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too.</strong></em></p>

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Chair
Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you
are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the
concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It was not getting rates high enough in time
to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that was the concern.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still
trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you can see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think, and
I think, that the risks are getting more balanced.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more—
closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That range, if
you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re
going to see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates
of a neutral policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now that’s arithmetic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the
economy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to
being in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you said the proof is how the economy
reacts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What are you looking at to be sure you’re not overshooting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still
broadly cooling?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where
inflation was clearly cooling and coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and
they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The data have bounced back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what are we
Page 24 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seeing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Are we seeing—is inflation still coming down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s the first thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The second
thing is, in the labor market, what we’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and
demand, partly through just much more supply coming online.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And with labor demand still
clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last
quarter, it’s still very strong demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So—and you see wage increases coming down as we
discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that’s—we want to see that, that
whole set of processes continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Bryan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>BRYAN MENA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Bryan Mena, CNN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you think that there has been any structural
change in either consumption or in the job market that’s pushing at consumption?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You
obviously saw the third-quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect
everyone’s spending to have fizzled out by now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m kind of wondering if there’s been any
structural change in consumption.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
would say it’s certainly been strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so a couple of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We may have underestimated
the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There
may be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount
of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really
at all, or in-person services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think,
although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of
savings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We may not be there yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So things are—clearly, people are still spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than
inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises
Page 25 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
spending, which continues to drive more hiring.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so you’ve had a really—that whole—that
whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off, so that
goods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, from a
business standpoint, there are more people to hire.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And it is more labor supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the whole
thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s been—you know,
it’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, it’s been a dynamic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question is, how long can that continue?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I just
think this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the
pandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still
learning.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning
about how it plays out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s all we can do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>DANIEL AVIS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel–Hamas conflict.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel–Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine
“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained
disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve had
organizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war spreads to
other countries in the region.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments
in the Middle East—you mentioned they are—and just what the potential economic impact could
be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t want to speculate too much, but I’ll just say so—you
know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things
Page 26 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we’re talking about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The price of
oil has really not reacted very much so far to this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As the—you know, as the Fed—as the Federal
Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and
economic effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it isn’t clear, at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going
to—is on track to have significant economic effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly
important and something for people to, you know, to take really important notice of, but it may
or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an
economic body.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “calls out” risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s what it’s doing—[it] is calling out a risk of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the war in Ukraine, the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The war in Ukraine did have, immediately, very
significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, thank you.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 20, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>My colleagues and I remain squarely
focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the
American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Looking ahead, we’re in a position
to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be
appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and
the evolving outlook and risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and,
so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Recent readings on
consumer spending have been particularly robust.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Activity in the housing sector has picked up
somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage
rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In our
Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments
Page 1 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Participants expect growth
to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate
ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has moved
up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward
pressures on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from
3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Based on the consumer
price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the
12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core
PCE prices rose 3.9 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,
and longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad
range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
has a long way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this
year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure
on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from
tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of how far we have come in
tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the
federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our
securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP,
FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the
federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most
likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this
year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Compared with our June
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year
but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>These projections, of
course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the
path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability
goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the
Page 3 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well
as the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the
incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Real interest rates now are well above
mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties
in precisely gauging the stance of policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,
and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving
down sustainably toward our objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price
stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over
the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What makes the
Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive,
Page 4 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s noted uncertainty about policy lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Headwinds have emerged from the looming
government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt
payments—things of that nature.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit
differently.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at
5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we say we’re
committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive
to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the fact that we decided to
maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have
not at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you looked at
the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants
believe that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates
one more time in the two remaining meetings this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Others believe that we have already
reached that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by
deciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, right now, it’s still an open question about “sufficiently
restrictive”—you’re not saying today that we’ve reached this level?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we
decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to see convincing
evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—
we’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we need to see more
progress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
COLBY SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And just on the 2024 projections—what’s behind that shallower path
for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Right.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real
interest rates are, are positive now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We
need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we need—
we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, you know—
remember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a
plan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a cumulation of individual
forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t want to,
you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But what it reflects, though, is that
economic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be
appropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our
inflation goal, as you see in the SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Rachel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding
steady?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could
you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our
current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But this,
of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’ve got—you
have some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between
Page 6 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now and the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next
two meetings that we have between the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it wasn’t like we were arguing over
that—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see
how the data come in.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
want to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last
three months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to see, you
know—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good
example of what we do—of what we do want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was a combination of, of, you know,
of—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those are
the two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that
we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be
careful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that
the data, you know, support that conclusion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and
how quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we
assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting
by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in your view, what would—I know nothing has been
decided yet—but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to
inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out
for us?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one
way or the other won’t matter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a
pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always
Page 7 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to be learning from data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ve learned all through the course of the last year
that, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you go back a year—and what we
thought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we don’t really
know until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A
year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now—now we’re fairly close, we think,
to where we need to get.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t
attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Nonetheless, you know, we
need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you
know, we’ve been moving toward it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at
which we’ve moved.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that was appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And now that we’re getting closer, we, we—
again, we have the ability to proceed carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Steve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby’s
question here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What is it saying about the Committee’s view of the inflation dynamic in the
economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a
point of the funds rate on it?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does it tell you that—does it tell us that the Committee believes
inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine, effectively?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I guess a related
question is, if you’re going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a
row, at what point do we start to think, “Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually
higher”?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense
of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen
Page 8 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that’s something
that’s appeared in the recent data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s more about stronger economic activity, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to
attribute one explanation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates—
we have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
terms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We only
know it by its works, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we
use, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you
know, there are lags here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has
risen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising
their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher
than, than the longer-run rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run
rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is
higher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more
resilient than, than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’ve said
several times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation
consistently back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit—1.5 percent is just a
touch below what’s the estimate of potential.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So the fact that you’re getting so much done at so
much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how
Page 9 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction
that’s necessary to achieve this?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now
meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s,
that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and
in the jobs–worker gap.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I would
say, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to
be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so
that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate
comes down.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better
balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So all of those things are happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we
don’t see a big increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is
just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is not guaranteed.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There, there
may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what
we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So just to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we’ve
gone from a very narrow path to a—to a soft landing to something different.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you call the
soft landing now a baseline expectation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, no—I would not do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I would just say—what, what would
I say about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that
there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted
off.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Ultimately,
Page 10 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I do
think it’s—I do think it’s possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know—I also think, you know, this is why we’re in
a position to, to move carefully again.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That—we, we will restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we know
that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we
have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is
an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t want to handicap
the likelihood of it, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not up to me to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Chair Powell, both you and
Vice Chair Williams have indicated that “sufficiently restrictive” will be judged on a real rather
than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year—provided further
compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the FOMC focused on
targeting a real level of policy restriction?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And can you explain what would constitute enough
evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real
policy settings sufficiently restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter
and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, I would say, you know—you know
“sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You—it’s not something you can arrive at with
confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so what are we seeing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the
pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing
Page 11 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand—the combination of those two things is
actually working.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s principally now in
goods—also in housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think—we think that that is working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want
to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think
confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels
like it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that
level—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s a whole other set
of questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s what
we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But it looks like there was—because there was an across-the-board
drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it
seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same
real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you—than you
currently anticipate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and,
certainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the
data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and
the other events that are happening out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I
can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a
Page 12 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that
would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help
us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Following up on Nick’s question,
actually—John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of,
“Next year, as we see inflation kind of”—again, to Nick’s point—“as, as we see inflation coming
down, we’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we’re not squeezing the
economy harder and harder over time.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wonder if that’s basically the logic that you
apply—you know, is that how you think about it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then I also wonder—in the last press
conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, “It’s a full year out—those
discussions,” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’t see a possibility of a rate cut in
the first half of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you
know—how you’re thinking about that timing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals
about, about cutting, I’m never intending to send a signal about timing; I’m just answering them
as, as the question is expressed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry—
the first question was, is that how?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question
we’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about
the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some
point, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Part of that may be that
real rates are rising because inflation is coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the
factors that we see in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 13 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that
might be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there’s—you know, there’s so much uncertainty around that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In, in—
when we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one will look back at this
and say, “Hey, we made a plan.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not like that at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—this is—these are estimates made
a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that’s how it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks so much, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wonder—how
do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we’ve been seeing is driven
by excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, relatedly,
if GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own
be a reason to consider more tightening?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very,
very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust
in its—in spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, your second
question was—
NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Does GDP stays “hot,” but without inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question will be, is, is the
level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get
back to 2 percent inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s going to be the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not—it’s not a question about
GDP on its own.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you
know—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent
Page 14 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
in a sustainable way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we’d be—we’d be
looking at GDP just, just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Victoria Guido with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are multiple external
factors that are playing out right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We see rising oil prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see auto workers striking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I was just wondering,
for each of those things, could you talk about how you’re thinking about how that might affect
the course for the Fed and the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it—
you know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments,
higher long-term rates, oil price shock.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you
can—you can look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and
handicap all of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these
things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the
strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we, we do have to make an
assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so
uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It will depend.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve
looked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s really
going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we—and then it also
depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So none of those
things are known right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very, very hard to know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you just have to leave that
uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and we’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period,
much more about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the same is true for the others.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we—I don’t know if you
Page 15 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
mentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t comment on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
hasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—energy
prices being up can affect spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It can affect the consumer over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A sustained period of
higher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We tend to
look through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But so the question is,
how long are, are higher prices sustained?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic
effects into account as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those are—those are some of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not sure if I hit them all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’re, you’re coming into this with an economy that
appears to have significant momentum.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s what we start with.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we—but we
do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CRAIG TORRES.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was a little surprised, Chair
Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This economy’s seeing
added supply in a way that could create long-term inflation stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have prime-age labor
force participation moving up where people can add skills.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Workers want to work.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have a
boom in manufacturing construction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve had a decent spate of homebuilding.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And since
inflation’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All are
which—good for the Fed’s longer-run target of low inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if we lose that in a recession,
aren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So are you taking this into
account as you pursue policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say
otherwise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The, the real point, though, is—the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price
stability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don’t restore price stability, inflation
comes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very
uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It can be a miserable period
to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and
again.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
now, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move
carefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we fully appreciate that—you know, the
benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market
and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in
unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of
what some economists are calling “the low-hanging fruit”—such as the unwinding of supply
chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions—or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that
involves most goods and services across the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way:
I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we
lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of
these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the
response.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that unwinding was going to be important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, monetary policy was going
to help.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general,
Page 17 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
better aligning supply with demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those two forces were always going to be important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
think it’s very hard to pull them apart.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They work together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I do think both of them are at
work now, and I think they’re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we—that we are
seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Mike.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In June,
you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you’ve more than
doubled your growth forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, what
would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And given all
the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or
the American people have in your forecasts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, forecasts are highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Forecasting is very difficult.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But to get to, to your question,
though—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Stronger than expected—and
that’s required higher rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate
unemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in
the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing
significantly higher unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, we’re continuing that trend.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of inflation,
you, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s only three readings,
you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if you look
at June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core
inflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in
nonhousing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those are the three buckets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Headline inflation, of course, has come way
Page 18 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think—people
should know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain
forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But these are—these are our forecasts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, they’re, they’re—we have very
high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other
forecasters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Given the—given the forecast that you have, what justified not
moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming
down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate
increases that we’ve made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly,
and we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary
policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the
risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening
becomes more equal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach
that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that, that’s what we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So
we’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more
carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need
to get inflation back down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>With your focus on year-over-year PCE, isn’t it true that base effects are huge
and that by the time you meet in November, that it’s more likely that you’ll have a low PCE
number that would make you feel more comfortable?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, secondly, how would the lack of key
Page 19 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
indicators—like CPI, the jobs report—impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to
have a government shutdown?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What was—missed what
factors?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The base factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Base factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on that, we’re, you know, we’re
looking at just monthly, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase
was from the prior month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base
factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we can—we can adjust for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we
don’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It—it’s possible—if, if there is a
government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t—
we wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we
would just have to deal with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s hard for me to say in advance how that
would affect that meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects
that—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November,
would you feel more comfortable at that point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, yes.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how
much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, that’s what we’re looking
at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And month by month, what’s the reading?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I think—I think what we’re
really looking at is, there’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but
they’re incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s why we look at 12-month [rates].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But I think, in this situation—where it looks like we’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in
June—we’re also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months’ inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That—that’s the right way to
go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what
to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can let the data evolve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for the question, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I want to focus back in on oil prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re seeing oil prices, as you
mentioned, move up, and that’s pushing the price of gas.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So how does that factor into your
decision to raise rates or not—because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we’ve
seen, the overall inflation has actually risen?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, energy prices are very important for the
consumer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This, this can affect consumer spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It, it really
comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The reason why we look
at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how
tight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>However, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high,
that’ll have an effect on spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations
of inflation—things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s just things we have to monitor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the consumer—they’re putting more and more of this on
their credit card.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How long do you
Page 21 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And are you concerned
about a, a debt bubble related to that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to
look through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Consumer distress—
measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—
during and after the, the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re now moving back up to normal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re
watching that carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic
era.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yields along the Treasury curve
have risen to their highest in years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is the Fed’s view about what’s been driving that
increase in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations—and how
much to technical factors?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, rates have moved up significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I
think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition
of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation
expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields—
and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a
very precise answer, but they give you different answers.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re
moving up because—it’s not because of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s because probably—it’ll probably have
Page 22 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
something to do with stronger growth, I would say—more, more supply of Treasuries.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KYLE CAMPBELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kyle Campbell, American Banker.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking the
questions—just two on, on housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline
and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’s also some questions out
there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which
are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental
market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it’s measured and
felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And then as far as a constrained housing
supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now
than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about
taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over
time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so—and supply is kind of
structurally constrained.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as,
as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re-
leased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A year ago, it would have
been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So as
those leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing
services inflation coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your second question was the lock-ins.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much is that
affecting things, really?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 23 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
KYLE CAMPBELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates
down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a
lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea
being that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they
want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly
in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight—
in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, I, I don’t think it would.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
mean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what,
what rates does the economy need?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic
or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point
that—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think
that that would be a reason for us not to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not something we’re thinking about at all
right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair
Powell, you’ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence,
maybe cut back consumer spending—possible government shutdown, high gas prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At this
point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Would that help you get
inflation closer to your 2 percent target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I wouldn’t say it that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re not looking for a decrease in
consumer spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a good thing that the
Page 24 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we’ve done.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a good thing
that the labor market’s strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The, the only concern—it, it just means this: If the economy
comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary
policy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that answer your
question?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I guess, on the other hand, would you
worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, that’s always a concern.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I mean, concern number one is, is
restoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that
we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight
labor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that said—of
course, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how
quickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of
that consideration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of
rate sensitivity than in the past.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Obviously, we’ve talked about households with long fixed-rate
mortgages—also companies that refinanced before last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is your thinking about the
efficacy of rates and how that’s changed?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, related to that, how do you think about the
distributional consequences in the sense that if you’re a relatively wealthy household with a long
fixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if
Page 25 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a
lot tougher a lot more quickly?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has
been stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why is that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One, one
is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had
understood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not sure about
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question is whether that’s
sustainable.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could
also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long
enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s—there are many candidate explanations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to, in, in all this
uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a
very strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We were making progress on
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth is strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call
for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s where we are, and, you
know, we have to—we have to deal with what comes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On your second question, which was—
sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer
about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My point there was that if you’re somebody who has a
long fixed-rate mortgage, you’ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you’re
somebody who’s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are
punitive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 26 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so the point I would make there is that we’re trying to get
inflation back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a
fixed income.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you’re a person who spends all of your income, you don’t really have any
meaningful savings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You spend all your income on the basics of life—clothing, food,
transportation, heating—the basics—and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you’re in trouble right
away, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and,
and we, we want to do it as quickly as possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Obviously, we—we’d like to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’d like
the current trend to continue, which is that we’re making progress without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that we’ve seen past—in past things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you’re right, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When
we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to
feel that more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a—have a
much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to—it’s not going to affect
them as much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>GREG ROBB.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the Beige
Book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups
about the economic health of low-income Americans—moderate-income Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I have two
questions about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a
quarterly survey of those groups—like the senior loan officer survey?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And from your—and also
the second question is, from your recent look—readings of these surveys, how are low and
moderate Americans doing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy

Americans kind of driving things?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s an idea we
can—we can take away and think about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you
know, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think during the pandemic,
the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, if you know
the—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were
actually in very, very strong financial condition.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and
you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of]
real wages are now positive by most—by most measures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think, overall, households are
in good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Surveys are a different thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of
that is just, people hate inflation—hate it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s
terrible.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, at the same time, they’re spending money.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Their behavior is, is not exactly what
you would expect from the surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
I, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in
the labor market and with wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low-
wage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages,
which is a good thing.</del></p>
