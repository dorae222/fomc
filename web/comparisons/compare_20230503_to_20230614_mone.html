Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest
pace. <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p>Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained
low. <small>(0.584)</small></p>

inflation, and economic and financial developments. <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p>In addition, the Committee will continue
