Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our, our goals over the past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To that end, today, the Federal Open
Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by
lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also decided to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a—at a solid
pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants
generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over
the next few years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate is
higher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nominal

wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, a
broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in
2019.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median
projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and
4.3 percent over the next few years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and
2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thereafter, the median
projection falls to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on
both sides of our mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds
rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼-4½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral
setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing
further progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With today’s action, we
have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is
Page 2 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now significantly less restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further
adjustments to our policy rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering the extent and timing of additional
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not on any preset course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their
individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each
participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median participant projects
that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and
3.4 percent at the end of 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These median projections are somewhat higher than in
September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These projections, however, are not a
Committee plan or decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If the economy remains strong and inflation
does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more
slowly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly
than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is well positioned to deal with the
risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility
to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate—its typical configuration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, and I look forward to your
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking
our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’s appropriate
to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what
would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Would a January cut potentially be
possible, or does a pause next month seem more likely?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and
then—and then move to 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it
was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of
our goals, maximum employment and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We see the risks as two-sided: moving too
slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly
and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re trying to steer between those two
risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I’ll give you some
details on why.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is
now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and
orderly way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold
unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as
surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor
market than there was, than we had in 2019.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s still quite gradually cooling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we keep an
eye on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we’ve
made a great deal of progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November
is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Twelve—but 12-month inflation
has actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we
might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for
goods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent
and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at
which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You ask about 2025.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year
really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that
inflation will be higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we
see as higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think
the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We’re, we’re going to react to data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks
is likely to be appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you
make those cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this
way: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re significantly closer to
neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But as
for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as
continued strength in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And as long as the economy and the labor market are
solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And all of that is reflected—to
your question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next
year, compared to four in September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the
opportunity to ask you a question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the
last transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in
part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s
the split on this one?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in,
and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I’d say—I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start—let
me start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place, and we think policy’s in a
really good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that
Page 6 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation has come down by 50 percent to, to—from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Headline
inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re actually in a really good starting place here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First
thing is growth is stronger, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so
far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next
year as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants
think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that’s, that’s more
strength, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation is higher, as we talked about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation’s higher this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also higher in the
forecast next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another
reason to be cautious about, about further moves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but then getting to your—to your point,
there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some
people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of
economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some
people said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we
have people making a bunch of different approaches to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But some did identify policy
uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the
path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking
into a dark room full of furniture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You just slow down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that may have affected some of
the people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and
uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The upside risk to inflation jumped quite
substantially.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the
disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The only
real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is it fair to say that that’s what’s
driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What’s happened
is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in
September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, November is, is back on track.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, once again we’ve, you know,
we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached
the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can tell you that
might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to
expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s way below
where it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I
mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s
in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing
inflation down and keeping a solid labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRIS RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking
the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking
Page 8 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through” any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations
remained anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other
thinking on tariffs generally that you can share?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative
simulations are a good place to start.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I happened to have brought them here with me today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m
sure you have them too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you
know, it’s six-years-old analysis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right
questions to ask.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing
through,” one was not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see-
through” paragraph.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to
“see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not
be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we won’t face that
question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What the Committee’s doing now is, is
discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can
affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, we’re,
we’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it
puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make,
you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy
response.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Do you, given the recent bout
of inflation that we’ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and
businesses being—seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a
Page 9 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
little bit riskier to look through tariffs?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, are—do you feel that you have to respond more
quickly to inflation threats, given what we’ve seen the past few years?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative
simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs
will, will even go into consumer inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How persistent will that be?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, so, we
just—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very
premature to try to make any kind of conclusion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what
countries, for how long, and what size.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know,
retaliatory tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be
into consumer prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last
episode is or is not a good model for what happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You pointed out we’ve just been through a
period of high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve just gotten through that period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a difference.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was also
quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that
may have affects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a
very careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how
they’re implemented.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re at the
stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions,
but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, to make sure
I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the
central tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the
Page 10 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if inflation only declines next
year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let me—let me find these numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we have—we have inflation
coming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’d be—that’d
be significant progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see a slower path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that does take on board that we want to
see real progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation
down to that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you
know, better than this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That would be meaningful.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We,
we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And while we, we have the
labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very
gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s also something we need to keep our
eye on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these
projections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing” language in the statement, which has
been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it’s going to be on hold for a
while, and they said, “Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,” would they
be mistaken to, to infer that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at
all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let me explain “extent and timing.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if
the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate
to slow the pace of rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can
reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Clearly, that distance has
shrunk by 100 basis points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s significantly smaller.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s the “extent” question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 11 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And, again, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor
market, to make those cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>“Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy
develops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of
adjustments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that’s what we mean by that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not trying to make decisions about the
longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I
just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that
we expect significant policy changes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s nothing really unusual about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we need
to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll, we’ll have a
much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Even
though you’ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven’t seen much change in
mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You say you’re significantly restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you
running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of
a slowdown than you anticipate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are,
are really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,
but they’re also affected by many other things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And longer rates have actually gone up quite a
bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example,
mortgage rates more than short-term rates do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at that, but we look at all financial
conditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what we see happening in
the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth
Page 12 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for a very long time, and it keeps not happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have—we’re now well into another year
of growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It looks like it might be 2½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Third and—second and third quarters were right
about at the same level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Substantially
better than our global peer group.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I—there’s no reason to think a downturn is, is any
more likely than it—than it usually is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We have to stay on task, though, and
continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re also
going to be looking out for the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to keep the labor market pretty close to
where it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job
creation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so
that’s what our policy’s trying to achieve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up by asking about—your formulation for
beginning rate cuts included the phrase “we need to have confidence that inflation is moving
down towards our target.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Given the fact that you’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you
have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve
made—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re, you
know, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than
that, we have been—for headline inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has
come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why
that portends well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You, again, you do see with housing
services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down
now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s
Page 13 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
nonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate
better with, you know, new leases that turn over.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not, not new tenants, but new leases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Market
rents is new leases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it
was before the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way
because of used cars and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we think, overall, that should generally be in the
range it was in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are
in, in good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed
rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much
about the, you know, about tightness in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>They don’t really reflect that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, a
good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that,
that’s how that inflation works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s, it is cooler by so many measures
now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So
it’s not a source of inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know,
particular professions where labor is tight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses
of any significance from the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what’s the story?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that
the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in
insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing
insurance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we and most
other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It might
Page 14 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take another year or two from here, but I, I’m confident that that’s the path we’re on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the
unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level
that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the
50 basis point cut in September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But now
the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what has changed
about the Committee’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Is there just less
concern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now
needs to be accounted for?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in
July: 4.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And job creation is, is
lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s been
steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would
hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you might—you might—if,
if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that
level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of
thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So gradually declining.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We, we do think the
labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s, it’s not
cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, you know, you pointed
out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative
Page 15 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it
doesn’t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, you know, we’re
watching it closely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the
labor market is welcome here, what’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get
to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t need it, we
don’t think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few
months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent
months been moving sideways in the 12-month window.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so we’ve got to weigh them both,
at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused
on, on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we
think are broadly, roughly in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that’s how we think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word “recalibration”
today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this
new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it
was before.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we may get
around to that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I
said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis
points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re significantly closer to neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We still think where we are is meaningfully,
meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move
Page 16 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
cautiously and look for progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support
economic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that’s a good thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think it would—I
support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think from now we are
in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it is kind of a new thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We moved pretty quickly
to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is
consistent with, with the SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the
Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we’ve had in the recent inflation
numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the
avian flu, that, that kind of stuff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation
coming down, as it did in the recent report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the
numbers we don’t like, you know?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], “Look, those
high months are wrong.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What about the low months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ve got, we have a very
low month, potentially, in November.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens
for core PCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that could be idiosyncratically low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We try to look—we try to look at not just
a couple or three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We shouldn’t have—our, our position shouldn’t change based on two
or three months of good or bad data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We have a long string now of inflation coming down
gradually over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it’s 12-month headline’s 2½; 12-month
core is 2.8.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s way better than we were.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We still have some work to do, though, is how
we’re looking at it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get—to get that work done,
we think.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks Chair, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin from Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Financial markets
have been very buoyant, really all year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the Committee comfortable with where financial
conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine
progress on your inflation target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s
part of what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our—
of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what we’ve seen over the
course of—just take the last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of
years—come down a lot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That suggests that
our policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected
by—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Housing activity is, is very low,
and that’s partly, significantly because of our policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we think our policy is working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
transmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, a
lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the
places where we’d expect to see it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do
you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we, we’re not allowed to own Bitcoin.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Federal
Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re, we’re not looking for a, a law change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the
kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.</strong></em></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’re confident
that we’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years
ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s pretty clear we’ve avoided a recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think growth
this year has, has been solid, it really has.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which
we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real
growth] this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is a really good number.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, the U.S. economy has just been
remarkable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the
story, is that how well the U.S. is doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you look around the world, there’s just a lot of
slow growth and continued struggles with inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I feel—I feel very good about where the
economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the—you, you
guys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>However, employment rates have
fallen rather quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point—half a
percent, rather—recently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The question, I guess, is, do you think there’s maybe more downside
momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think so, no.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age
participation is still very high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is
low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you are looking
for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come
Page 19 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further
softening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I didn’t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in
the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the
action, with, with an additional cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is
very low—again, participation is high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable
level—wage growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you
know, we want to keep it that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Amara.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>AMARA OMEOKWE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just
want to put a finer point on the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Can you keep the labor market this way, in the
strong position that you have described, without further cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In other words, do you still view
the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I,
I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in
balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, job creations are, are
meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be
sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you, if you take into account
the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to
2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the
downsides clearly appear to have diminished.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals,
Page 20 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually
cooling—gradually and in an orderly way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, that’s, that’s how I would
characterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As you’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>High prices are
still a burden for so many households right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Why do you think it is that inflation is proving
to be more stubborn than you’d expected?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it
just has been a little bit more stubborn.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think if you go back two or three years, many people
were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you
know, high unemployment by now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path
down has actually been much better than many predicted.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We, we’ve managed to, to have the
unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come
down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a
12-month basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why hasn’t it come down [more]?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around
the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents
have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two
years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s part of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I
think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we, we
understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s
Page 21 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s
tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This was everywhere in all the
advanced economies at the same time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but
people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The best
we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and
keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their
wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year
upon year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what it
will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the
biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly,
I’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place; our
policy’s in a really good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I expect another good year next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward
Lawrence from Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you say that we’re closer to the neutral rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What percent do
you see, and the Committee believes—where is that neutral rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll say a couple things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First of all, when we, when we write—
the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate,
which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in
balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is not where we are right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when
we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you can’t do a
Page 22 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
straight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the
appropriate policy should be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and
we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s
having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are
lasting but not permanent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually
affect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re
looking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say,
we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points
closer to it right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot
closer to it, and I think we’re in a good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re
going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little
more clarity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I, I think
the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where
that, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models
of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There, there are empirical models,
there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different
answers as you’d like.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there is no real certainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing
to know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh,
Page 23 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I think this model or this estimate is right.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You, you just have to be open to, you know, the
empirical data that are coming in and also how it’s affecting the outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s not made any
easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s
appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to,
to neutral, and we’ll do so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these
cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make
progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just wanted to make sure I
understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Are you saying that progress
on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then also,
since that’s what’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Why, why do
you all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is
headline inflation, because that’s what people experience.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People don’t experience core
inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s the overall
goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can
fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really
good predictors of future inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of
overall inflation than overall inflation is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at core inflation because it’s a better
measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of
Page 24 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what inflation pressures exist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s—it’s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know,
our goal is headline, not core.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So your question was, your second question was what?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially
ticking up?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and
food prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with
forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year,
then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it—that, that’s why
the two can go in different directions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year,
but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything
about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’re thinking about
energy prices?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know,
but—really carefully, rather.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven’t really—
nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking
about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary
statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the price of
oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we
Page 25 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly,
at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it remains, you know, a risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kelly O’Grady from CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I want to
go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
wasn’t the case for some time, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s partly why Americans haven’t felt much relief in
their wallets from prices yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in
closing that gap could go away?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months
of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we, what we had was—we had
four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then
November is much lower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising
upside risk to inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I think inflation is much lower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What the public is feeling, and they’re
right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your,
your real compensation is growing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, in other words, your compensation’s growing
meaningfully faster than inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just
want to hold onto it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what’s
going on right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation
really signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s now been pushed out to
Page 26 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
2027.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You said you’re focused on enabling further progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not necessarily
progress in the right direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you confident that target isn’t going to move further out?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you
know, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Very high
uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently
predict where the economy is going to be in three years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what we’re doing is we’re looking at
what’s happening now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are
happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods
and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their,
their prior level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces
come together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s every reason to think that they will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The timing of it is highly uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit
frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, we’re still on track.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d
said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people
would be, would say, “I’ll take that.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job’s
not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Go to Nancy for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer from
Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it
appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you think the Fed is just going to
have to settle for that and accept that you’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 27 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, we’re not going to settle for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think we’re, we’re, you
know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we’ll get inflation back
sustainably to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is—and I am confident we will achieve that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has taken longer,
but it’s, you have to be—you know, we are making progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have made a great deal of
progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we owe
the public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, we’re committed to achieving it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’re at 4.3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s, that’s
meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make
progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—Thank you very much.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 7, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent
as of September.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting
maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint
by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We continue to be confident that,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor
market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also
decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say about monetary
policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This figure would have
been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment

in October.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families,
businesses, and communities who have been harm—harmed by these devastating storms.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over
the past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has
eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, a broad set of
indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the
pandemic in 2019.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose
2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we’re attentive to the risks to
both sides of our mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range
for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This further
recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor
market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more
neutral stance over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that reducing policy strain—restraint too quickly could hinder progress on
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic
Page 2 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and
the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are not on any preset course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy remains strong and inflation is
not sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the
labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than
anticipated, we can move more quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and
uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that our
affect—actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to our discussion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given the expectation that the election outcome will
produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the
Committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the
next one in December?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive
the Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next Administration?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 3 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no
effects on our policy decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and
anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to
forecast, looking out past the very near term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Here, we don’t know what the timing and
substance of any policy changes will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We therefore don’t know what the effects on the
economy would be—specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the
achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t—we
don’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, just in principle, it’s possible that
any Administration’s policies or, or policies put in place by Congress could have economic
effects over time—over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
we—along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in
our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Roughly
one year ago when the 10-year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30-year mortgage rates
were near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh
on economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Given that you’ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now
dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today
any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above
your target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would just say this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve watched the, the run-up in bond
rates, and it’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess that, you know, the long-
Page 4 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
run rates are well below that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re watching that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Things have been moving around,
and we’ll see where they settle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s too early to really say where they settle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Ultimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I
certainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I will say,
though, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way
of downside risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what they’re about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we do take financial conditions into account.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If they—if they’re persistent
and if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would say
we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just something that we’re watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
again, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other
factors in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up—is the September SEP—are those rate
projections still valid?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know what?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between
the last set and the next set.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The NIPA
revision was stronger.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October
report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of,
of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the
NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
think we would factor that in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
At the same time, we got one inflation report, which was—it wasn’t terrible, but it was—
it was a little higher than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, really, the question is, is December.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you
know, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report,
two more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we
get to December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically
as you try to make that decision?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, as of the Fed’s economic projections in September,
you, you had written down four quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you still think that
those are likely?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if it
shifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of, of detail as to why?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I can’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,
and I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I can’t really speak for kind of
exactly where the—where the Committee is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would just say, for December, we’re going to
be—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that
affects the outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at
5.33 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re, we’re asking
ourselves, “Is that where we need to be?”</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between
the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too
slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re trying to, to be on a middle
path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress
Page 6 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think that’s where we are, but that’s the question we’re going to be asking in
September and, and in other meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, I can’t really update you on the Committee’s
thinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, total—totally appreciate that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess when it comes to your
own thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a
reasonable outlook?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, I’m going to wait—we’re going to wait and see how things
come in in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I—it’s just—I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more
neutral stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and that’s very much what we’re on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That has not changed at all since
September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Obviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say
that, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know,
where the Committee would be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wondered if you
could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement
here in the first paragraph when you say, “Inflation has made progress,” dropping the word
“further progress,” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had
“gained greater confidence” that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there
any policy substance behind either of those changes in language?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it—is it meant to open the
door to a December pause?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core
inflation in the last three months?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 7 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not really, no.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me tell you what we were thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the test
of gaining further confidence was a—was our test for the first rate cut, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we, we met
that test in September, and therefore we take that test out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you leave it in, then it’s new
forward guidance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s brand new forward guidance. “</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What do you mean by it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you—are
you making—are you requiring yet further guidance?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to say “yes” or “no” at every
meeting whether we’ve made further progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The point is we have gained confidence that, that we’re on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, I would tell you, is, is what that’s really all about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s not meant to send
a signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neither of those is meant to send a further signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, saying “further
progress” it becomes a test where we don’t want to be—we don’t think it’s a good time to be
doing a lot of, of forward guidance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re—there’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that—in what I’ve said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
path that we’re on, we do know what—where the destination is, but we don’t know the right
pace, and we don’t know exactly where the destination is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the—the—the point is to find that,
to find the right pace and the right destination as we go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think there’s a fair amount of
uncertainty about that, and, you know, you don’t want to tie yourself up with, with guidance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher
rates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You didn’t talk about it in terms of
expectations of higher deficits.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in
interest rates, and is that—are rising deficits a concern to you?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we don’t comment on fiscal policy, and, again, I don’t have a lot
more to say on, on what’s driving bond yields.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of, of policy changes, though, let me
give you a sense of how this, this works in the ordinary case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s say Congress is considering a
rewrite of the tax laws; it doesn’t matter what’s in the content.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we would follow that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At a
certain point, we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we’d start to model it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then we’d wait,
and we’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “This
is—these are the likely effects.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy
changes on various parts of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’d, we’d try to get smart on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then the
law actually passes, and, you know, you’d start to put it—you’d probably run an alternative
simulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then, then when it
actually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, these—we have a very large economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many things are affecting it at any
given time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but—it would go in,
but it would—you know, it’s a process that takes some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Clearly, the legislative process
takes a lot of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, the real question is not the effect of that law.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s all of the
policy changes that are happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the
economy at any given time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that
we go through all the time with every Administration, constantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I just—this will be no
different.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, right now, we’re—there’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right
now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s such an early stage.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know what the policies are, and once we know what
they are, we won’t—we won’t have a sense of, you know, when they’ll be implemented or, or all
those sorts of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think I would just say—
STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 9 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL. —</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>we’re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be
very much regular order when we do do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could just follow up on Nick’s question—are the current rates
something you feel like you need to lean against, in that they go against the direction of policy
by being—adding restriction to the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a
signal that you should do less?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—look, I just think—the first question is, how long will they be
sustained?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you remember the 5 percent 10-year, people were drawing massively important
conclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, it’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that
really matter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t know that about these.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we’ve seen so far?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re
watching it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but
right now it’s not a major factor in, in how we’re thinking about things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You
mentioned the positive economic data that we’ve seen since the September meeting, including
the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We saw a stock market jump yesterday.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this—with this
backdrop?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest
economic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But, of
course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with
today’s cut, policy is still restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how
Page 10 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
restrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you look at our goal variables, the labor
market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially
in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further
cooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and
we judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So the job’s not
done on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was
appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision
is really another step in that process.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an
appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even
as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just to follow up, could you—what might
cause you to pause rate cuts in December?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What kind of economic data would lead you to that
path?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
we’re—so we’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down—our stance down over
time to a more neutral level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to
adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, for
example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more
quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may
turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you—
you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
Page 11 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, you know, it—we’re thinking about it that way, but it’s, it’s something that we’re just
beginning to think about.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So with, with this noise in the jobs
reports that we’ve seen and you look at the Fed’s favorite inflation, PCE inflation, overall it’s
2.1 percent—very close to the Fed’s target—but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it’s been that
way since July.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So why doesn’t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting
the 12-month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at all of them, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re
around 2.3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at all of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we expect there to
be bumps.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings
were very, very low—probably unsustainably low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts
generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the other hand, the January
reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
there will literally be a bump up and then down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 12 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say,
“What’s—what is the inflation story now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where is it coming from?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I point to a couple of
things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that—
of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained
2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So they’re back at that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s not is housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let’s talk about housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Housing services is higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s going on there
is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what’s
happening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to
where market, market leases are—market rent leases are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s just a catch-up problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s
not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s, that’s one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary
pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where is it coming from?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not a very tight economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is the story about
inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re
seeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent
with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and
settling around 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data
months, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re
this far into the process.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you’re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you
see, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 13 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nothing in the economic data suggests that the Committee has any
need to be in a hurry to get there.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We are seeing strong economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are seeing
ongoing strength in the labor market; we’re watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining
strength there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is
carefully, patiently.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, that’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we—to the
extent—to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of
that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CRAIG TORRES.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Two questions
today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election
results?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and
I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum-employment side of the
mandate, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One of the
broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Compensation
gains are sliding back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading
down to that bad neighborhood of the 20-teens.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole
saying any “further cooling” is unwelcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is cooling, generally, a little bit further.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So at
what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything
that relates directly or indirectly to the election.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the second one, you’re—you know, this is
the great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll just say a couple things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 14 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, there’s nothing really surprising here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What we know is that the
unemployment rate is low.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We also know that it’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up
significantly from a year or so ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sometimes that has meant bad things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So far, it doesn’t appear to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It appears that the—I
wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very
gradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And our policy, of course, is designed to keep
it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further
progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, the, the
openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would—I would characterize it more
broadly as “normalizing.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wages are still running just a bit above where
they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to
remain at this high level.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at
these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I would say—in fact, you can
say it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given
current productivity readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high
readings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That
has always been the case for 50 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If
you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set
of productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, overall, it’s a good labor
market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We could talk about 20 different data series.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 15 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But, you know, we don’t want the labor market to, to soften much from here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We don’t think we
need that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Victoria Guida with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some of the President-elect’s
advisers have suggested that you should resign.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If he asked you to leave, would you go?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you follow up on is—do you think that legally that you’re not
required to leave?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You talk
a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in terms of
forward-looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials
around the country?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What did you hear today from the regional Bank presidents about what
companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than
looking backwards?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you
think the appropriate policy path should be?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of
discussions we had, and, of course, you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would
say this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the
CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive,
feeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer
Page 16 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking
about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So they feel like the labor market’s in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People feel good about where the economy is.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Demand is obviously pretty strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
you know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Maybe the
year is 2½. This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s actually remarkable how
well the U.S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor
market, inflation coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, you know, really performing better than any of our
global peers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think that is reflected in what you hear from—what I hear people hear from
CEOs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from
those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that, and it’s pretty
constructive overall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, that’s not to say—there are areas of caution and things like that but,
ultimately, overall pretty positive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on
the horizon that you identified as something you’re watching, what would they be?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks
around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the U.S.
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about
those as, you know, something that’s on the horizon all the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, ultimately, if
you look at the U.S. economy, its, its performance has been very good.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And that’s, that’s what
we hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If anything, people feel next
year—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 17 of 23

ANDREW ACKERMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just
wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your predecessors Greenspan and
Volcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial—
economic or financial stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Will you do that, too?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, right now, we’re in a period of full
employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have large budget deficits and debt at historic, historic highs that are—and
rising.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that something you’d speak out against?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the
predecessors you mentioned have said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal—federal
government’s fiscal path—fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The level of our debt
relative to the economy is not unsustainable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The path is unsustainable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And,
you know, you’ve got a very large deficit at—you’re at full employment, and that’s expected to
continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it’s important that we—you know, that that be dealt with.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is ultimately a threat
to the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, I can say that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t have oversight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t have oversight over
fiscal policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve said it on many occasions—just said it again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess the only other question is—to
follow up on Victoria’s question—do you believe the President has the power to fire or demote
you, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other
Governors with leadership positions?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not permitted under the law.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not what?</del></p>

COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In response
to Howard’s question, you said it wasn’t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the
economic uncertainties.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not
it includes some of the proposals that the President-elect has put out on the campaign trail—
tariffs, for instance?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at
all, nor will I today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I
mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess I should start by saying
that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very
good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And one risk is that
we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes
back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have to avoid
that risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The other
risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do
unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that says, “Don’t
get behind the curve.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
we’re, we’re in the middle there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage
both of those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor
market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,
enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so there’s—you know, there—
this is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right
path is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 19 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, it’s not as important—the precise timing of these things is not as important as
the overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of
neutral, a more neutral policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its
works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But as we move further, there will be
more uncertainty about where that is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re going to move carefully as, as this goes on so
that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I know you don’t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look
at the breakevens, it, it is clear that longer-term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at
about 2.5 percent, for example, on the five-year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s up half a point from when you cut in
September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you have any concern at all that longer-term inflation expectations are
deanchoring or, put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we, we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw
longer-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not what we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I
looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s
just—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, overall,
expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with
2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow
inflation expectations to drift upward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in
2022 was, was to avoid that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly O’Grady, CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just talked
about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans
are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what’s your message to them
on when they might expect relief?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So you’re right that, you know, we say that the economy is
performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,
for example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock, and
inflation went up everywhere.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, you know, it, it stays with you because the price level
doesn’t come back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people
to feel better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think we’re well
on the road to creating that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has come way down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is still strong here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages are moving up
but, but at a sustainable level.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening
and, for the most part, has happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain
their confidence and feel that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about
the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those feelings are true;
they’re accurate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t question them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—you know, we respect them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just a quick follow-up—President-elect Trump has been
critical of your performance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Any concern about his influence on the Fed’s independence?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not going—I’m not going to get into the—any of the political
things here today, but thank you.</del></p>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is your plan if we start to see stagflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so
we don’t have to deal with it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s our—that is actually our plan. [</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Laughter] You know,
it’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with
interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the
employment mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I would just say that, you know, we’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a
whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in
unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So knock on wood, we’ve
gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we believe we can
complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is
exactly what we’re trying to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t rule anything out or in that far away.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s
certainly not, not our plan.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I mean, our baseline expectation is that we’ll continue to move
gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and
that the labor market will remain strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at our—look at our—that will not change
from the September SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, that is our baseline forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, short of some
exogenous event, it will—that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—
but, ultimately, you know, it’s—we’re not in a—we’re not in a world where we can afford to
rule, rule things out a full year in advance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—there’s just too much uncertainty in what we
do.</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wanted to go
back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the
cumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path
to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal
under the average inflation-targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s not the way our framework works.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re aiming
for inflation at, at 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re—we do not have—we do not think it would be appropriate
to deliberately undershoot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be
a problem, too, in a way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s not part of our framework, and it’s not something we’re
going to be—going to be looking at in our framework review.</del></p>
