Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 13, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Good afternoon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been
made toward our dual-mandate objectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come
without a significant increase in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s very good news.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But inflation is still too
high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As
we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Our actions have moved our policy rate well into
restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity
and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that
we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will make decisions about the extent of any
additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from
the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Even so, GDP is on track to expand around
Page 1 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving
supply conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>After picking somewhat over the—up somewhat over the summer, activity in
the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business
fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants
revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median
projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly
for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Although
the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available
workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing
upward pressures on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises
somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose
2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and
energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 2 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need
to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our
goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a
broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from
financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation
all the way to 2 percent will take some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent
this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle,
the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing
progress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re committed to achieving a stance of
Page 3 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a path to that
objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to
raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and
2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve
as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In determining the extent of any additional policy
firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will
take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary
policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-
term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage
for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Chris Rugaber.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted
to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “any” before “additional . . .</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>firming” in
the statement?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, does that mean that you’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the
Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the
extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy
firming”—that sentence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe
that we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Participants didn’t write down
additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But participants also
didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s really what we were
thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Fed
Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several
months could be cutting interest rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree
with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn’t cut
rates if inflation fell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, sir.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, of course, I don’t comment on, on any other officials, even those
who work at the Fed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the way—
the way we’re looking at it is, is really this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When we started out, right, we said the first question
is, how fast to move, and we moved very fast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The second question is, you know, really, how
high to raise the policy rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s really the question that we’re still on here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re
very focused on that, as I—as I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People generally think that we’re at or near that and,
and think it’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’t take that possibility off the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—when you get to that question, and that’s your answer, there’s a natural—naturally, it
begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back
the amount of policy restraint that’s in place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s really the next question, and that’s what people are thinking about and, and
talking about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would just say this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that
appears to be moderating; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so
many measures; and we’re seeing inflation making real progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These are the things we’ve
been wanting to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We still have a ways to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one is declaring victory.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That would be premature.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we can’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re,
we’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s, that’s really the question that we’re on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, of course, the other question, the question of
when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place,
that, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion—topic of discussion out in the
world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it, it comes up in this way today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everybody wrote down
an SEP forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So many people mentioned what their—what their rate forecast was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there
was no back-and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like, “This is what I wrote down;
this is what I think,” that kind of thing, and a preliminary kind of a discussion like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not
everybody did that, but many people did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, and I would say, there’s a general
expectation that this will be—this will be a topic for us, looking ahead.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, that’s really what
happened in today’s meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I can’t do the head count for you in real time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s generally
what happened today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Rachel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a
recession and isn’t heading for one now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if the answer is “no,” I’m curious about what
you’d still be looking for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the
economy is in a recession now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next
year, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s always a
real possibility.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I have always felt, since the
beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could
cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that
have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So far, that’s what we’re
seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This result is not
Page 7 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
guaranteed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is—it is far too early to declare victory.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there are certainly risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
certainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has done that
repeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, where we are is, is we
see the things that I—that I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m curious, if you’re looking back on the past year, you talked
about “navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you talk about some of the ways in
which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way
and had to pivot to respond?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very
broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And not only did that not happen—that
includes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of
forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually
had a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on
the supply side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked
up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages
and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we had significant supply-side gains with
strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth
year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just
because of the healing on the supply side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that was a surprise to just about everybody.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but
in a very different setting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has
also been significantly better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a
Page 8 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
significant increase in, in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It didn’t really happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re still at 3.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So
we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that’s coming back into
balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a—you
know, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for
taking the questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what—on what
motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’s a coincidence, for example, that the spread
between PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you’re expecting, in
the rate of inflation that you’re expecting as opposed to supporting the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nothing quite that mechanical is happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The SEP really is, is a
bottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think people are looking at what’s happening
in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is
that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know,
really significantly in three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a big piece of, of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, [real GDP]
growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter. [</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now it] is slowing, we believe, as,
as appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again,
significant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re
seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But so I think that
people look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast
and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We tabulate them and, and publish it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so it’s
not—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 9 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, that’s—that is—that is something that we’re very
conscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we
think about things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as you well
know, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how
tight policy is at any given time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you
would get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is
declining as we—as we move forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has, has
already kind of begun.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering, just related to, to Steve’s question, how the—how the
tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into
2024, the closer you get to a presidential election.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you want to front-load this, in other
words?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
don’t think about politics.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The
minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to think,
what’s the right thing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time
we—when we think is the right time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’ll always do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I mentioned we’re moving carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One of the things we’re moving carefully about
is that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough,
really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s us thinking that
we have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to
Page 10 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, it’s not the base case anymore,
obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s, that’s how we’re—that’s how we’re
approaching things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks
about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start
to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having
going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time
goes forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, you’ve
argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the
market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The market is now easing policy
on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that’s a full point below the
current level, with cuts beginning around March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is this something that you are broadly
comfortable with?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw
thing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and
moving back and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what
we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really
focus on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going
to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in any case,
we have to do what we think is right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned
or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course,
Page 11 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
because we will do what it takes to get to our goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, ultimately, that will mean that
financial conditions will, will come along.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in the meantime, there can be back-and-forth,
and, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And my colleagues are
focused on that, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Do
you believe we’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Listen, I welcome the progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s, it’s really good to see the
progress that we’re making.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures,
you see very low numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That isn’t to say—
I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just need to see more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
need to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s what we need to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And that—it’s one of our two
jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re very focused on, on, you
know, doing that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re pleased with the
progress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is
a lot of uncertainty about going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen the economy move in surprising
directions, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If
growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than
Page 12 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Or, put another way, is below-trend
growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth is one thing,
so is inflation, so is labor market data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’d, we’d look at the totality.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we—as we make
decisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and,
particularly, about the—as they affect the outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and
the balance of risks as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’ll be good for the
labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we
will set policy according to what we actually see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and so that’s how I would answer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess the—I guess the question I’m asking, if you don’t mind a
quick follow-up, I guess the question I’m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s only a
problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, you know, if you
have—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor
market very strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That could
mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That could mean we need to keep rates
higher for longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just is—
it’s the way, the way our policy works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Neil.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you interpret the state
of the labor market right now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, in particular, you’ve referred even today to evidence that
Page 13 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it’s coming into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that
balance?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s—
you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given
population growth and labor force participation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The things that are not quite—but let me go on
with that list.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, claims are low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re—
sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and
they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at shortages of
workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to
it, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation,
unemployment—so many measures: the unemployment—job openings, quits, all of those
things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation
over a long period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>They’ve been gradually cooling off.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if wages are running around
4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I guess there, there are just a couple of
other—the unemployment rate is very, very low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And these are—but, but I would just say,
overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s been a good time for
workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Claire.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CLAIRE JONES.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I’d say the mood among
economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat
corroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a soft landing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yet when
Page 14 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we—when we hear from the general public, there’s a lot of discord about economic conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It may be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down,
and that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Prices of some, some goods and
services are coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So people are
still living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And,
you know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now
positive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that might help improve the mood of people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The thing that we can do is
to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits
over such long periods of time, and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and
achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families
and, and companies around the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask, you know, on,
on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start
to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we’re seeing now, how would you
all think about that in terms of rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Would that be a sign that you’ve, you’ve done your job
demand-wise?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry—if?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If, if the economy starts to—looks like it’s starting to fall into a
recession; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 15 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not something we’re hoping to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Obviously, we’re hoping
to, to see something very different—which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the
labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment,
inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating
without a significant increase in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we’re, we’re trying very much to
achieve and not something that we’re looking to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of
the data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the
beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on
that decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr.
Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight
inflation, and you said earlier, again, “the full effects of our tightening (cycle) have not yet been
felt.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’re not behind the
curve there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
we do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of
overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on
the price-stability mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do
Page 16 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you’re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates—you’re getting now
back to the point where both mandates are important, and they’re, they’re more in balance, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, we’re, we’re
obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see the same
thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in
2023.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you see what the forecasts are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the median growth—median participant wrote
down 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very hard to predict.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’ll also
be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but
ideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be
essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and
error, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really
specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used
in, I guess, 2013.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really
worked out yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence of Fox
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is, is showing, about 75 basis points, does that
signal that there’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 17 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It wouldn’t, if that were to—first of all, let me just say, that isn’t a
plan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s not something—you
know this, but allow me to say it again: We don’t debate or discuss what the right, you know,
whose SEP is right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So and
it’s, you know, it’s important for people to know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it wouldn’t need to be a sign of—it
could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn’t need the tight policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
depends on—the economy can evolve in many different ways, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So but, but it could be
more of what I just described.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And you focused on core inflation, we’ve heard from—in
other meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How sticky is core inflation right now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve
seen real progress in, in core inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is
thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which
was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are seeing some progress
there, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing:
goods, housing services, nonhousing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re all contributing in different—at different
levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, yeah.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Catarina.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CATARINA SARAIVA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this,
you know, this morning and yesterday.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the
forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking,
you know, on the inflation outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 18 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we got—we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we
got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s
very late in the game, you know, to—but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to
update their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>After that, so staff has to—has to
cumulate all of that and create the documents that you see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So until about midmorning, a little,
maybe late morning, it’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast
based on what we saw today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And do you see—I mean, how are you, when you think
about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do
you, you know, how do you think about the economy we’re in now kind of post-pandemic?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do
you think that there’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look
at a rate cut path?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question of whether there have been fundamental structural
shifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The one that
would affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate
of interest is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to
have risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey
the same level of restriction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The thing is, we’re not really going to know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s just
that it’s going to be uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really
unprecedented environment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the
natural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy
Page 19 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
operates with a lag.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We started
slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s—
you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it
doesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Maybe people just bought so
much stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They haven’t got anyplace to put it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>[Laughter]
MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Jennifer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to
2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On a six-
month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and
shelter, they are, of course, stickier.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when looking in the different components of the data,
how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates
is that policy would be, it would be too late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the
economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,
if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it takes—it
takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I can’t give you a precise answer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you
know, I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would
take.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 20 of 24

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to identify any one precise
point, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be
right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jean Yung with Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to go back to
the stickiness-of-inflation question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have
talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it’s also
been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m curious, do you think something
has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or is it
something different about the U.S. economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—I think this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we felt since the beginning that it
would be a combination of two factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what
happened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And the second thing would
be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the
supply side to recover because of lower demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We thought those two things were going to be
necessary.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If there was something different about the U.S. economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the
U.S. economy being different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload,
pot-boiling-over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was a combination of very
strong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but

also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is just very
unusual.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, you know, we had the view—my colleagues and I broadly had the view—that we
could get a lot of—you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve, because you ran into
the limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren’t workers and because people
couldn’t—the supply chains were all broken.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So we, we had the view that you could come
straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, something like that has happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It happened so far.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question is, you know, once,
once that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort
of supply chain and shortages side has some, some ways to run—does labor force participation
have much more to run?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It might.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Immigration could help, but it may be that, at some point—at
some point, you will run out of supply-side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets
harder.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s very possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be
different, I’d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
just don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, inflation keeps coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market keeps getting back
into balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And it’s so far, so good—although we kind of assume that it will get harder from
here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But so far, it hasn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll go to Megan for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MEGAN CASSELLA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’s focus now on
proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And can you talk us through what the latest
thinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening
at all?</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now,
just to get that out of the way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we’ve been
seeing is, you know, that we’re allowing runoff each month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s adding up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’re
down—we’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s showing up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The reverse repo facility [take-
up] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or—as a result—or
holding steady.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At a certain point, you know, there won’t be any more to come out of, or there’ll
be a level where [take-up at] the reverse repo facility levels out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, at that point, reserves will
start to come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we still have—you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until
we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that
consistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the
balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with
ample reserves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion
[dollars].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not—we don’t think we’re at those [levels judged consistent with ample]
reserves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There isn’t a lot of evidence of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re watching it carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, so
far—so far, it’s working pretty much as expected, we think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time
you’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that time to rethink, or are you
still going to follow that thinking?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re asking,
though, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such
time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the answer is,

it depends on the reason.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, if you’re—if you’re—if you’re cutting rates because you’re
going back to normal, that’s one thing, [and distinct from] if you’re cutting them because the
economy is really weak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you can imagine, you’d have to know what the reason is to know
whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 1, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Good afternoon, everyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Welcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>My colleagues and I remain
squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for
the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain
strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that
tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full
effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given how far we have come,
along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will
make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain
restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and
well above earlier expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an
outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>After picking up
somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well
Page 1 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates also
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic
levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined
so far this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the
supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has moderated since the middle of last
year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But a few months of good data are
only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down
sustainably toward our goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a
long way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain
well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecastters, as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
Page 2 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are
confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand
for labor.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is
no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further
tightening of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher
longer-term bond yields, among other factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Because persistent changes in financial conditions
can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments
closely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation as well as the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In determining the extent of additional policy firming
Page 3 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring
price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices
over the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Howard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair Powell,
for doing this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To what—you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields—to what degree did
that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for your question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want
to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, if
you—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has been coming
down, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market has been
rebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>GDP growth has been strong, although
many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 4 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
As for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that’s
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we’re not confident yet
that we have achieved such a stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that is the broader context into which this, this strong
economy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of
rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields
and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the
path of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming]
from higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower
equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that is something
that remains to be seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s critical.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not
what we’re looking for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are
material.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t
simply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we
didn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and I would say on
that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the
increase in longer-term rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is
that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households
and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this
tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,
Page 5 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
which could have pretty significant effect on housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how I would answer your
question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this: In your opening
statement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions
are restrictive enough to finish the fight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that true?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s exactly right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, to say it a different way: We
haven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have not made a determination,
and we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—that is—the
way we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the
extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to
2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you so much for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I
wonder, you know, if you don’t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at
that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting
rate increases next year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about
September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re asking a hypothetical there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll
get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on
economic activity, and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation, the broader financial
condition situation and broader world situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be looking at all those things as we make
a decision in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t made that decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I would say, though, that, that the idea that if you—the idea that would—difficult to raise
again after stopping for a meeting or two, it’s just not right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the Committee will always
do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about—
at all about December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December
today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, did the Fed
staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today’s meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening
is persistent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the
spring.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is it here on something that’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar
to simulate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the
recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the answer is “no.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the
minutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity
we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be
doing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can see
how volatile it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an
estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very
quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you
can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 7 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And over time, that will have an effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just don’t know how persistent it’s going to be, and
it’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I’d be comfortable communicating into how many
rate hikes that is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident—what
makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above-trend growth when
500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and
sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you
raise interest rates, you do see those effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you see those effects in the economy now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see what’s happening in the housing market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re seeing that now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ll see, if you
look at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds
because rates are so high now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the
effects of this—of this could be quite significant.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This has been a resilient
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there are a number of possible
reasons why that may be.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,
and so we take the economy as it comes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COLBY SMTH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the
thresholds that you’ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence
of persistently above-trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market
tightness—that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike
would be necessary.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m just curious if that’s how the Committee sees it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ve identified those factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those were not meant to be the
only factors or a specific test that we’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Really, we’re going to be looking at the broader picture.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, what’s happening with our
progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Is the labor market continuing to, broadly, cool off
and achieve a better balance?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll be looking at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, growth—we look at growth
insofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at that, and we look at broader
financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you
know, whether we need to further tighten policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, if we do reach that judgment, then we
will further tighten policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COLBY SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if
that is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates,
what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could we see those maybe pulled
forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts
right now at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not talking about rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re still very focused on the first question,
which is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is the question we’re focusing on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Will policy remain
restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident
that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’ll be the next question, but
honestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question of rate cuts
just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you
know, as close to right as you can.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 9 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that
there was a tightening bias in the Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You say in the statement you’re looking to assess
the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There were forecasts for two rate
hikes among most members of the Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But then you just said that, you know, we
don’t—we haven’t made a determination.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there
is no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for
two hikes?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, one additional—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say that at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say—I mean, the language,
looking at it here, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate
to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the question we’re asking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the Committee
here?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question
we’re asking is, should we hike more?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and
you’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know—and
we’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRIS RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, since the last
meeting, the auto workers’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet, on the other
hand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you see all those factors,
taken together, affecting the economy going forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How are you thinking about those?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 10 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, there are significant issues out there, as you point out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Global
geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that goes for the war in Ukraine; it goes for the
war between Israel and Hamas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re monitoring that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our job is to monitor those things for
their economic implications.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to
an end.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Oil prices have flattened out; they haven’t gone down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess they’ve gone down a
little bit from their earlier peak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we
don’t know about that one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s plenty of risk out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would go back to—the
bigger picture from our standpoint is, we’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market,
making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re very focused on
getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently
restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s really our focus.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just one quick thing: You, last month, had gone to
York, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of—or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot
of small business owners.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you
pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of
what they talked about?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was very impressed by
York as a town with a real strategy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there
have put together in the face of, you know, some difficult longer-run trends about offshoring of
manufacturing and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’ve done a great job as a city, I think.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know,
what you hear—and it’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You were there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We talked to some people who, you know, were feeling that in their
businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s
Page 11 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
painful for people—particularly people who don’t have a lot of extra financial resources who are
spending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That wasn’t new.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in
York, and, you know, I walked away from that even—you know, I mean, just thinking that we
really—the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability—fully restore price
stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage
we can.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rachel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for
the economy in order to get inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But since the economy has not responded to rate
hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all—on
how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall
growth?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been
able to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the same is true of growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And growth has been
strong, but yet we’re still seeing this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I
think still believe, that is likely to be true.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely
that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor
market conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but it’s only a good
Page 12 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
thing that we haven’t seen it, and I think we know why.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, since, since we lifted off,
we, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One of them—one of
which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the
pandemic and the response to the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary
policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space
to recover.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But it’s
that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower
growth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and
bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in
the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of
why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, we welcome that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think,
and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Against that backdrop, if you’ve gotten any clarity on lags—if you
have an economy that’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that
there isn’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that&#39;s still coming through the pipeline and
that it may have already come into effect?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s been one
year at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s a
full year since then.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this
year—we’re seeing it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you can, for
Page 13 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
example—an example where you wouldn’t have felt this yet is, is debt that had been termed out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and there
are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags
are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is
really not a good way to do it.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process
down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it takes time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that, and you can’t rush it.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better
sense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m
trying to connect the dots here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel’s question
is, you said you need slower growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You had always said before a period of lower-than-trend
growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Has that changed?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, two, it sounds to me like you’re basically saying here that kind
of the dot plot’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase
for right now—doesn’t matter about the turn of the year—and that there’s not an objective way
to determine whether or not you’ve got enough tightening in the system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just going to be a
subjective judgment, meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the dot plot is a picture
in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in
light of their own personal economic forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s
not, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a forecast that would
change, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I
Page 14 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wouldn’t write down that dot six weeks later.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Think of the number of things that could change
your mind on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three-month
period between that meeting and the next meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, nonetheless, it’s out there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t—
we do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, I
think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be—
my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was
“below potential.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily—
potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So the right way to
think about it is, what’s potential growth this year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People think trend growth over a long period
of time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what we’ve
had is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned,
through both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning
in the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and
shortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>There’s
catch-up growth that can happen in potential.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that means that if you’re growing—you could
be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output
of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I hope that’s clear.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s really what’s going on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s why I would say it as
below potential.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by
meeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting
Page 15 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at
each meeting?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s
characterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, we’re going meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive
to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re looking
at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we
look at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking
cycle, very far.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a
relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re close to the—to
the end of the cycle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not a
promise or a plan of the future.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’re going into these meetings one by one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re
looking at the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re proceeding
carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Monetary policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see
its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how I think
about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of the run-up
in long-term yields we’ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the
pace of your asset runoff program?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if there were judgment that higher—that the higher-
term premium was endangering the dual-mandate goals, would that be reason to think about
slowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around
reserves?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance
sheet runoff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not something we’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many
candidate explanations for why rates have been going up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And QT is certainly on that list.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it’s
not—I think—I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s not something that we’re—that we’re looking at right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask about the Basel
III Endgame capital proposal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve gotten a lot of “pushback” from people on different
aspects of the proposal, and you yourself expressed some reservations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m just curious:
Could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, that proposal is out for comment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we expect a lot of
comment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
we’ve extended the deadline.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll take them seriously.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll read them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll say what,
what I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It means broad support.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jonnelle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JONNELLE MARTE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in addition to persistence,
when you look at long-term Treasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those
tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further
tightening?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 17 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what do we look at?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at a very wide range of financial
conditions and, in fact, as you’ll know, different organizations publish different financial
conditions’ indexes, which can have, you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables,
so there’s a very rich environment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we tend to look at a few of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not going to give
you the names, but, you know, they’re a few of the common ones that people look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
they’re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates,
the credit spreads.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sometimes they’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn’t
any one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We would never look at, for example, long-term Treasury rates in isolation, nor
would we ignore them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play
a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your second
question was?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On the banking stress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you know,
we, we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in
the March—the things we went through in March and thereafter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’ve been working a
lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that
they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we do think the banking system is quite resilient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had, you know, a handful of bank
failures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t have any reason to think
that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong
banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,
on funding, and those sorts of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 18 of 27

SCOTT HORSLEY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott Horsley from NPR.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Last week you
and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for
comment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there—what it would mean for
merchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of
both debit and credit cards in the—in the payment system?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, so you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We put a proposal out for comment, is
what we did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in
Dodd-Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s all we’re
trying to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What else can we really do?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t
comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we do hope that
stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They
haven’t been shy about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that
now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Chair.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So for the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core
well over 3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but
with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus
overall inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and
be bumpy, but we’re making progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came
down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the best thing I could point you to would
be the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of
Page 19 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year, on a 12-month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further
into the 2s.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So that’s, that’s—if you look historically, that’s, that’s sort of consistent with the
way inflation comes down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get
further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the good news is, you
know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we feel like we’re on a
path to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you’ve said in the past that doing too little on interest
rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How robust
was the debate about this pause on the doing-too-little side?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we know
that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get
entrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation will be both
more—both higher and more volatile.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so
we’re really committed to not letting that happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, for the first year or so of our
tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, you know, we’re—
we’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can’t
identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will.</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Quick follow-up
to the question about banking stresses—you talked about how the banking system is resilient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of
course, part of the resilience the past year stems from the Bank Term Funding Program that you
launched in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
probably mounting, how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next
year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Good question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking
about that yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the
first quarter of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Quick second question about inflation
expectations—the U. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one-year-ahead inflation
expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Last year you said that particular survey was a really
decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If it stays elevated next time around, how big
of an input will that be into your December thinking?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at a range of, of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the, the, the, you
know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was actually a preliminary
estimate that got revised away.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at many, many things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also
market-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between
meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it will—
they’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can always find one
reading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the
public believes that inflation will come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical
in winning the battle.</del></p>

MEGAN CASSELLA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for
taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned
today that you’re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, and you’ve recently said
that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I was curious if you could
elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view, has risen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So first thing to say is that it’s very important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a very
important variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with
any precision in real time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you have to just take that—you have to take
your estimate of it with a grain of salt.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What we know now is, you know, within a range of
estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on
economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we do—we do talk about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s not any
debate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or
not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Ultimately, it’s
unknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and
giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our
moves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down
to 2 percent over time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the question we’re asking ourselves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you know, years
from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to look—we have to have
those models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the
effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MEGAN CASSELLA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up on a wages point.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Earlier you talked about
the inflation outlook, but I’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its
current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have—
wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a
level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent
inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s much
closer than it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this
week.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and all of them
are kind of saying that, which is great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you have to look at a group of them because any one
of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what you see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so what
you saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if
you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down
substantially in June.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the
June reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our
expectations internally, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we feel good about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also I would say it isn’t—in my
thinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far,
although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy
becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of
the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too.</del></p>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Chair
Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you
are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the
concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It was not getting rates high enough in time
to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that was the concern.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still
trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you can see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think, and
I think, that the risks are getting more balanced.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more—
closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That range, if
you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re
going to see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates
of a neutral policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now that’s arithmetic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the
economy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to
being in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you said the proof is how the economy
reacts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What are you looking at to be sure you’re not overshooting?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still
broadly cooling?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where
inflation was clearly cooling and coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and
they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The data have bounced back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what are we
Page 24 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seeing?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Are we seeing—is inflation still coming down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s the first thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The second
thing is, in the labor market, what we’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and
demand, partly through just much more supply coming online.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And with labor demand still
clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last
quarter, it’s still very strong demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So—and you see wage increases coming down as we
discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that’s—we want to see that, that
whole set of processes continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Bryan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>BRYAN MENA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Bryan Mena, CNN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you think that there has been any structural
change in either consumption or in the job market that’s pushing at consumption?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You
obviously saw the third-quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect
everyone’s spending to have fizzled out by now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m kind of wondering if there’s been any
structural change in consumption.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
would say it’s certainly been strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so a couple of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We may have underestimated
the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There
may be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount
of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really
at all, or in-person services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think,
although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of
savings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We may not be there yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So things are—clearly, people are still spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than
inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises
Page 25 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
spending, which continues to drive more hiring.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so you’ve had a really—that whole—that
whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off, so that
goods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, from a
business standpoint, there are more people to hire.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And it is more labor supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the whole
thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s been—you know,
it’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, it’s been a dynamic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question is, how long can that continue?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I just
think this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the
pandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still
learning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning
about how it plays out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s all we can do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>DANIEL AVIS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel–Hamas conflict.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel–Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine
“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained
disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve had
organizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war spreads to
other countries in the region.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments
in the Middle East—you mentioned they are—and just what the potential economic impact could
be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t want to speculate too much, but I’ll just say so—you
know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things
Page 26 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we’re talking about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The price of
oil has really not reacted very much so far to this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As the—you know, as the Fed—as the Federal
Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and
economic effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it isn’t clear, at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going
to—is on track to have significant economic effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly
important and something for people to, you know, to take really important notice of, but it may
or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an
economic body.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “calls out” risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s what it’s doing—[it] is calling out a risk of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the war in Ukraine, the same.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The war in Ukraine did have, immediately, very
significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, thank you.</del></p>
