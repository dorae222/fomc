Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 30, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have
more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has moderated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GDP rose at a
1.2 percent pace in the first half of this year, down from 2.5 percent last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Although the
increase in the second quarter was stronger at 3 percent, focusing on the first half of the year
helps smooth through the volatility in the quarterly figures related to the unusual swings in net
exports.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The moderation in growth largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
contrast, business investment in equipment and intangibles picked up from last year’s pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Activity in the housing sector remains weak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged
150,000 per month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains
low and has stayed in a narrow range over the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wage growth has continued to
moderate while still outpacing inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that
conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat
elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index
and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June
and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose
2.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>These readings are little changed from the beginning of the year, although the
underlying composition of price changes has shifted: Services inflation has continued to ease,
while increased tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Near-term measures of
inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about
tariffs, as reflected in both market-based and survey-based measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Beyond the next year or
so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent
inflation goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to determine the appropriate
stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Changes to government policies continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy
remain uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some
goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>A
reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time
shift in the price level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more
persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 2 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent
a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For the time
being, we are well positioned to learn more about the likely course of the economy and the
evolving balance of risks before adjusting our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see our current policy stance as
appropriate to guard against inflation risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We are also attentive to risks on the employment
side of our mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In coming months, we will receive a good amount of data that will help
inform our assessment of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds
rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We focused on potential revisions to our Statement on
Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and are on track to wrap up any modifications
by late summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
price—stable prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing
inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand
that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There is a lot of “lean” in the
markets and, not to mention, out of the Administration, for a rate cut now in September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is that
expectation unrealistic at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as you know, today we decided to leave our policy rate where it’s
been, which—where I would characterize as modestly restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation is running a bit
above 2 percent, as I mentioned, even excluding tariff effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market’s solid—
historically low unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Financial conditions are accommodative, and the economy is
not—the economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back
inappropriately.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it seems to, to me and to almost the whole Committee that the economy is
not performing as though restrictive policy is holding it back inappropriately, and modestly
restrictive policy seems appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All that said, there’s also downside risk to the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In coming months, we’ll
receive a good amount of data that will help inform our assessment of the balance of risks and
the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So just to follow up: By, by “coming months,” does that
include the possibility you’ll, you’ll be getting essentially two rounds of jobs and inflation data
between now and the September meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is that potentially adequate to make a decision to
lower rates at that point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We do have—this is an, an, an intermeeting period
when we’ll get two full rounds of employment and inflation data before the time of the
September meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have made no decisions about September—we don’t do that in advance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be taking that information into consideration and all the other information we get as we
make our decision at the September meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You took out the word—or the notion
that uncertainty has diminished from this statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that mean uncertainty has increased?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And I’m just wondering, the Administration has struck several deals with large trading partners
where it seems like we now know what the rate is going to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does knowing that rate add to
your certainty to change policy, or do you need to wait to see the economic effects?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, essentially, the statement in the—in the—in our statement about
uncertainty reflects what’s gone on since the last meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, at the time of the last meeting,
uncertainty had, had, had moved down a little bit, but it was more or less even this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we
took out, you know, “had diminished” because it didn’t diminish further.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s not really
much in that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then your second question is—say again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There have been several deals that have been struck, and now we
seem to have an idea of what the tariff rates are going to be with some of our large trading
partners.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that not add to the kind of certainty you might need, or is it you’re waiting for the
economic effects to show, show themselves?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I think we’re still—so you’re right, it’s been a very dynamic
time for these trade negotiations, and lots and lots of events in the intermeeting period, but we’re
still, you know, a ways away from seeing where things settle down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are clearly getting more
and more information.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I think at this point, people’s estimates, our estimates,
outside estimates of the—of the likely, you know, effective, effective level of tariffs is, is not
moving around that much at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But at the same time, there are many, many uncertainties
left to resolve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, yes, we are learning more and more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t feel like we’re very close to
the end of that process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s not for us to judge, but it does—it feels like there’s
much more to come, you know, as well looking ahead.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 24

NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This morning, we got a GDP
report in which final domestic private purchases decelerated—slowest pace since ’22.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There was
a weakness in the interest-sensitive sectors and residential investment, commercial structures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are those not signs that monetary policy is a little too restrictive right now, given current
economic conditions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the GDP and PDFP numbers came in pretty much right where we
expected them to come in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got to look at the whole picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, certainly, as I mentioned
in my opening remarks, economic activity data, GDP, private domestic final purchases—which
we think is a narrower but better signal for future, for where the economy is going—has come
down to a little better than 1 percent, 1.2 percent I think, in the case of GDP for the first half,
whereas it was 2½ last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that has certainly come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if you look at the labor
market, what you see is, by many, many statistics, the labor market is kind of still in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s things like quits, you know, job openings, and—let alone the unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re
all very—by many measures, very similar to where they were a year ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you do not see a
weakening in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You do see a slowing in job creation, but also in a slowing—a
slowing in the supply of workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So you’ve got a labor market that’s in balance, albeit partially
because both demand and supply for workers has—is coming down at the same pace, and that’s
why the unemployment rate has remained roughly, roughly stable, which is why I said there—we
do see downside risk in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I mean, our two—our two mandate variables—
right?—are inflation and maximum employment—stable prices and maximum employment, not
so much growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the labor market looks, looks solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation is above target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And even if
you—if you look through the tariff effects, we think it’s still a bit above target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s why
Page 6 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
our stance is where it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But, as I mentioned, you know, downside risks to the labor market are
certainly apparent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on labor, given the fluid labor supply situation, is there a number for
this jobs report we get on Friday that would look to you like equilibrium job growth?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, the, the main number you have to look at now is the
unemployment rate, because if, if—it’s true that the, you know, demand for workers in the form
of, let’s call it—say—just say, payroll jobs—that number has come down, but so has the
breakeven number, kind of in tandem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, as long as the—that puts the labor market
in, in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The fact that it’s getting into balance due to declines in both supply and demand,
though, I think does—it is suggestive of downside risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re—of course, we’ll be watching
that carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Two of your
colleagues called for a quarter-point cut today, and I’m wondering what aspects of their
argument were most compelling to you and how you are weighing their views against those on
the Committee who, as of the June forecast, were in the camp of the Fed holding interest rates
steady for the remainder of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and just in terms of the June SEP in particular, is that
still the best representation of where the core of the Committee is?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So on, on the dissents, you know, what you—what you want from
everybody and also from a dissenter is a clear explanation for—of what your thinking is and
what are the arguments you’re making.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—we had that today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, basically,
this was—this was quite a good meeting all around the table where people were—you know,
thought carefully about this and put their positions out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, you know, the,
Page 7 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the—sort of the majority of the Committee was of the view that inflation’s a bit above target,
maximum employment is at target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That calls for modestly restrictive—in my way of thinking, a
modestly restrictive stance of policy for now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we had two dissenters who, I think—you
know, you want that clear thinking and, and, and, you know, expression of your thinking, and we
certainly had that today, I think all around the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of—you asked about the June SEP.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I wouldn’t—you’re right that that’s what it—that’s what it says, and that may—that
may well—I, I couldn’t point to it six weeks later as, as expressing people’s thought—you really
can’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t run an SEP, and I don’t like to substitute in my own estimate of what the
SEP might be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t have one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll just say that, you know, we, we haven’t made any
decisions about September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be monitoring all the incoming data and asking ourselves
whether the federal funds rate is in the right place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, just on the point about policy being only modestly restrictive,
does that mean that there’s actually not much scope to reduce rates once the conditions for a cut
are met, barring a significant weakening of the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say, my own estimate is modestly restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there
are—there are a range of views of what the neutral rate is at this moment for, for our economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so others may say it’s more restrictive or less restrictive even.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re—we’re
going to be—at some point, when we return to moving toward a more neutral stance, we’ll be
making that judgment as we go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think we have a preset course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not so mechanical as
saying, you know, “We’ve derived with great confidence the neutral rate, and that is our
destination,” because, really, we understand that no one actually knows what the neutral rate is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know it by its works, and that will be how—the way the economy reacts over time to—you
know, to slightly looser policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 24

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, my question
is about, what have you learned over the last few months about the inflation-generating and price
pass-through process?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to drill down: The June CPI report showed evidence of tariff-
induced goods inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now the tariff landscape is only starting to be settled with some of
these more recent deals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Given the lags between when tariffs are announced and when they
show up in goods prices, is two months a long enough horizon to evaluate the impact and be
confident that tariffs aren’t impacting the broader inflation process?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you have to think of this as still quite early days.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I
think what we’re seeing now is substantial amounts of tariff revenue being collected, on the
order of $30 billion a month, which is, you know, substantially higher than, than before.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the
evidence seems to be, mostly not paid, but paid only to a small extent, through exporters
lowering their price.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And companies or retailers, sort of people who are upstream—institutions
that are upstream from the consumer, are paying most of this for now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Consumers are—it’s
starting to show up in consumer prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you know, in the June report, we expect to see more
of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we know from surveys that companies feel that they have every intention of, of, of
putting this through to the consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, the truth is, they may not be able to in
many cases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s—we’re just going to have to watch and learn empirically how much
of this and over what period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ve learned that the process will probably be
slower than, than expected at the beginning, but we never expected it to be fast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think
we have a long way to go to really understand exactly how we’ll be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how we’re
thinking of it right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 9 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
NICK TIMIRAOS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So if I could follow up, is the reticence to “look through” core goods
inflation being driven by the judgment that during the pandemic, expectations proved more
adaptive than anyone at the Fed expected?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it being driven by uncertainty over how restrictive
policy is?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You could argue we are, a bit, “looking through” goods inflation by
not raising rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we haven’t reacted to, to new inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, I mean, I wouldn’t—I
wouldn’t insist upon that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I don’t think—I think the base case—I said—as I said, a
reasonable base case is that these are one-time—one-time price effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, in the end,
there, there will not be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This will not turn out to be inflation, because we’ll make sure that it’s
not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We will, through our tools, make sure that this does not move from being a one-time price
increase to serious inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to do that efficiently, though, efficiently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And that means
we want to do it—if you—if you move too soon, you wind up maybe not getting inflation all the
way fixed, and you have to come back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s inefficient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you move too late, you might do
too—unnecessary damage to the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there won’t be, in the end, a big inflationary
problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we’re trying to do is accomplish that in a way that is efficient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But in the end,
there should be no doubt that we will do what we need to do to keep inflation under control.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Ideally, we do it efficiently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The One
Big Bill, leaving aside the adjectives—do you expect it to add stimulus to the economy in 2026?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And would that be an argument for remaining on hold or cutting back on the number of rate cuts
you would expect for next year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 10 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, of course, let me just—ritual disclaimer that we don’t express
any judgments or anything, right, on, on fiscal legislation or other legislation, for that matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would say, when you think that, you know, the biggest part of the bill was, was making
permanent existing law on, on taxes, I don’t think we see it as particularly stimulative.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There
should be some stimulative effect, but it shouldn’t be significant over the next couple of years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And to follow up, what do you—well, I don’t want to put this in
terms of you and the President, so let me ask it this way: Do you have concerns about the cost to
the government of keeping rates elevated for longer in terms of interest rate charges?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>No, that’s—you know, we, we have a mandate, and that’s maximum
employment and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it is—it’s not something we do, to consider the cost to the
government of our rate changes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to be able to look at the goal variables Congress has
given us—use the tools they have given us to achieve those goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—we don’t consider the fiscal needs of the federal government.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No advanced-economy
central bank does that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it wouldn’t be good for—if we did do that, it would be good neither
for our credibility nor for the credibility of U.S. fiscal policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s just not something we, we
take into consideration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>When it comes to the
renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters that the Administration has been looking into,
do you see their interest in that issue as being directly tied to the President’s push to get you to
lower interest rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not for me to say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will say, we had a—we had a nice visit with the
President.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was an honor to host him.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something that happens very often at the Federal

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Reserve—to have the President come over, let alone to visit a building—but it was—it was a
good visit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are there any aspects of the project that they’ve raised that you see
as making you reconsider any aspects of the project?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we—this project was hatched and conceived almost a
decade ago now, and we went through the very long process of clearing it through historic
preservation at the National Capital Planning Commission and a lot of back-and-forth there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It
was very constructive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We started out to do the work, and we’re very well along on that work.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was quite pleased to have the President say multiple times that what he really wanted to
see was, was us getting this construction completed as soon as possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is our focus, and
that’s what we’re going to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Andrew Ackerman with the
Washington Post.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What message do you take from the fact that inflation hit 2.1 percent last
September and has bounced higher since?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why do you think financial conditions are restrictive
and in neutral rates below 4 percent when inflation has stopped falling for almost a year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So inflation—when you talk about these 12-month inflation
measures, you’re always battling residual seasonality.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll have, for example, two months
of high inflation, sometimes early in the year, and then inflation turns lower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And a lot of that
may just be an artifact.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s why we look at the 12-month numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I—look, I think
inflation is most of the way back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are things like the catch-up inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
for example, all the insurance costs that are now—they’re only now going through inflation, but
they actually reflect inflationary pressures from two, three years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s—that’s got to
Page 12 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
go through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, now we have, you know, three- or four-tenths of inflation in core
inflation from tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and we, we, we can’t really separate that out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re not going to
have a separate, you know, kind of inflation that isn’t the tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re always going to be
dealing with the whole—all of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we—the composition, as I mentioned, has really
changed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, if you go back to the last couple of years, it was all about services
inflation, which was being very sticky.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Now services inflation is coming down nicely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Goods
inflation was well behaved before, and now goods inflation is going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the story has really
changed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s partially because of tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also partially because we had restrictive policy
in place, and we—and we’ve seen that—the result of that gradually work its way through the
services economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other thing I wanted to ask is, are you comfortable
that BLS can continue performing their mission effectively if they take an 8 percent reduction in
head count and authorized spending, as the Administration has proposed?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not going to comment on the Administration’s proposal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do
think—as I’ve said, I think that we—you know, we’re, we’re getting the data that we need to do
our jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think it’s really important that, that good data helps not just the Fed—it helps the
government, but it also helps the private sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, people in the economy—they, they
use this data a lot, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s quite important for our economy and, certainly, for the Fed’s work
and other government agencies’ work that we—that we continue to get better at data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
what we’ve been doing for 100 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve been getting better and better and better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very
hard to accurately capture in real time the output of a $20-plus trillion economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the United
States has been a leader in that for 100 years, and we really need to continue that, in my view.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For, for cutting rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re waiting to see if the tariffs will
affect inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a wait-and-see approach so that—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, so that—you know, that would—that’s where we’re—policy’s
restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When we start cutting, it’ll go toward neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>This delay, though, where you’re saying it’s a one-
time—one-time price increase for tariffs, which they—which possibly could lead into bigger
inflation or more inflation, is that giving companies cover, though, to raise prices?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, what, what may be giving—it’s not our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What
may be giving—some companies will certainly be taking advantage of the fact of the tariffs and
all of the discussion of how they’re going to—you know, companies will raise prices when and
as they can.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you—so you saw it famously in the—in the—in the first Administration of
President Trump, during those tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Washing machines were tariffed, but, but, but dryers
weren’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what do you know?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Price—the price of dryers went up, too, just like washing
machines.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So companies will often just take—they’ll cross the street in a group, if you know
what I mean.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’ll happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t see a lot of that.</strong></em></p>

the very beginnings of whatever the effects turn out to be on goods inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know,

estimate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not going to be zero.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Consumers will pay some of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Businesses will pay
some of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Retailers will pay some of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we’re just going to have to, to see
it through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just a follow-up, if I could.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some additional tariffs have
been in place since February, and things, you know, really haven’t broken yet with the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So how, how do you justify to somebody who’s looking for a house, who’s facing a 7 percent
mortgage and maybe can’t afford those rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you justify that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, so the housing—the housing is a—is a special case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our—we don’t set—we don’t set mortgage rates at the Fed, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We set an overnight rate, and
the rates that go into mortgages are longer-term rates, like Treasury rates—it might be 30-year
rates, it might be shorter than that, but it’s not the overnight Fed’s rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not that we don’t
have any effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do have an effect, but we’re not the main effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are other things
go—though, going on in the housing sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And one of those is just, there’s kind of a long-term
housing shortage that we have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We haven’t built enough housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is not something the Fed
can help with, but then that’ll be the case even after things normalize.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I, I think the best thing
that we can do for housing is to have 2 percent inflation and maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s
the—that’s what we can contribute to housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are lots of other jobs to do for the private
sector and Congress, but that’s what we’re trying to get to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, I mean, we’ve made a lot of
progress toward that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re in—we have a very good labor market right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation—we
were very close to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>

very far away.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, can you give us a
little more about, what kind of economic data does the Fed need to see before you’ll be ready to
cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, do you need inflation back nearly to target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are there other things in the pricing
that you look for?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you need to see weakening in the job market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What kind of things are
you looking for?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, ultimately, it’s—it could be any—it could be any of those
things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but, you know, if you saw that the risks to the two goals were moving into
balance, if they were fully in balance, that would imply that you should move toward a more—a
more neutral stance of policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is—this is the special situation we’re in, which is, we have
two-sided risk, risk to both of our goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>When we paused, inflation was above target, and the
labor market was pretty good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so, you know, that was a time when policy—policy was
restrictive when we paused.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And to be restrictive is to be—to be supporting a return to our
inflation target, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So as the two targets get back into balance, you would—you would think
you’d move in, in, in a way closer to neutral and that the next—the next steps that we take are
likely to be in that direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What will it take?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’ll just take—it’ll be the totality of
the evidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, there’s quite a lot of data coming in, which, before the next
meeting, will it be dispositive of that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—you know, it’s really hard to say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t make
those decisions right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll have to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I guess just in terms of inflation, though, for
example, like, will, will you—some people would point to, if it remains only in goods and it
doesn’t bleed over to services, then maybe that’s evidence that the tariff effect is going to be a
temporary, one-time thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that kind of thing affect your thinking, or do you just need to see
the number come down—closer to 2?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 24

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—we’ll, we’ll, we’ll look at everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, it’s—as I
mentioned, you know, a pretty reasonable base case is that this will be a one-time price increase.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, in the end, we’ll make sure that that’s the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re just trying to do that efficiently.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re—and “efficiently” means getting the timing right so we don’t—again, if we go—if we cut
rates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s—history is dotted with
examples of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re trying to—we’re trying to get that timing right, and that’s effectively what
we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just a question on the dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’ve
seen it decline quite heavily this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was wondering if there’s been any discussion about that
at the meetings and how—to what degree that might be complicating your attempts to get
inflation back to target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this goes back to the division of labor between the Fed and the
Treasury—as you, I’m sure, know—and, you know, the, the, the Treasury only speaks to the—
speaks to the dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not—it’s not something that’s been a topic of, of, you know, major
discussion at all at, at—at the—at the Fed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I won’t say it doesn’t come up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The [FOMC
meeting] transcripts, when they come out in a few years—they’ll probably reflect some mentions
of the dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it would never be a, a major focus.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow on, if I may, to Andrew’s question, I think the
amount of imputed data in CPI now is up to 35 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, is there any discussion of that as
well?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there any consideration of looking at—into alternative measures, data scraping and so

on, in order to just ensure you’ve got a good read on what’s happening to prices in the U.S.
economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, we’re—so we’re monitoring the situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do, of course—
I mean, as you know, during the pandemic, we looked at a whole lot of new kinds of data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People are looking at big data sets that you can get from all sorts of places.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we do all of
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But at the same—we really need—the government data really is the gold standard in data,
and we need it to be—you know, to be good and be able to rely on it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re not going to be
able to substitute for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But if—we have to make do with what we have, but I certainly hope
that we get what we need.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jay O’Brien.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JAY O’BRIEN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jay O’Brien, ABC News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>President Trump has
obviously invoked your name a lot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>He has personally pressured you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Are you concerned the
way that conduct might impact the Fed’s independence going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll just say that—so I, I think that having an independent central
bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as long as it
serves the public well, it should continue and be respected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If it didn’t serve the public well,
then, then it wouldn’t be something that we should just automatically defend.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what it gives
us and other central banks—what it gives you is the ability to make these, these very challenging
decisions that—in ways that are focused on the data and the evolving outlook, the balance of
risks, and all the things we talk about, and not political factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so governments all over the
advanced-economy world have chosen to put a little bit of distance between direct political
control of those decisions and the decisionmakers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you—if you were—if you weren’t—if
you were not to have that, that would be a great temptation, of course, to, to use interest rates to

affect elections, for example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s something that, that we don’t want to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think
that’s pretty widely understood.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Certainly, it is in Congress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, I mean—I mean, I think it’s
very important.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll just say that.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MARIA ELOISA CAPURRO.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Afternoon, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Maria Eloisa Capurro from
Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You mentioned a slowdown in consumer spending, and I wanted to see if you
could “walk us through” what was the discussion with the Committee around that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen
delinquency rates rising for upper-income households.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you see that evolving in the next
few months, and how much of a vulnerability that is for the economy going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Consumer spending had been very, very strong for the last couple of
years and had—repeatedly, forecasters, not just us, had been forecasting it would slow down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And now maybe it finally has.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say, you know, if you talk to credit card companies,
for example, they will tell you that the consumer is in solid shape and that spending is at a
healthy level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s not growing rapidly, but it’s at a healthy level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And delinquencies are not, not
a problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned high-end delinquencies.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know what to make of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I read
the same thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—so, generally—and if you look at the banks and when the banks talk about
in their earnings calls, their—the performance of credit has been good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, essentially, you, you
have a consumer that’s in good shape and is spending, not at a rapid rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it, it, it’s true.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And it was, again, right in line with what we expected, the GDP data that we got this week.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—and I think it’s still a little bit difficult to interpret, because you have these massive swings
in net exports, which, which may also be affecting—you know, some of that can be affected
by—can affect consumer spending as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look, we—it’s one of the data points that we pay
most careful attention to, and there’s no question that it’s slowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’re
Page 19 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
watching it closely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we also watch the labor market and the performance of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those
are our two—those are our two variables that we’re assigned to maximize.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow up on what my colleagues were asking
about the dissents: Governor Waller said that the labor market is on edge, and he was pointing to
weaknesses on the private sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I was wondering, you’ve said that the main number to look at
is the unemployment number overall, but what was the discussion about the state of the private
jobs market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m not going to talk about any individual’s—you know, any
individual’s comments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, look, I think what we know is that private-
sector job creation, you know, certainly in the last report—we’ll see on Friday—but had come
down a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and if you—if you take the QCEW adjustment seriously, with it—it may be
even low—maybe close to zero.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But the unemployment rate is still—was still low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, what
that’s telling you is that, that, you know, demand for workers is slowing, but so is the supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s a—it’s in balance, oddly enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’ve got a very low unemployment rate, and it’s kind
of been there for a year as job creation has moved down, but also we know that, you know,
because of immigration policy really, the flow into our labor forces is just a great deal slower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And those two things have slowed more or less in tandem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you look at things, like I
mentioned, quits, look at wages—wages are gradually cooling—look at vacancies to
unemployment, those things have been pretty stable for—they haven’t really moved a lot in a full
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think if you take the totality of the labor market data, you’ve got a solid labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But I think you have to see that there are downside risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s not—you don’t see weakening in
the labor market, but I think you’ve got downside risks in a world where unemployment’s being

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
held down because both demand and supply are declining.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that’s—it’s worth paying
close attention to it, and we are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One more question on the lack of unanimity in today’s decision, the two dissents.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was there talk during the meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I know you’re not going to talk about what—exactly what
individuals said, but, in general, was there talk during the meeting of cutting rates, and what was
the case against that at the meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we have—we have an economic go-round,
where people talk about the economy, and then the next—to—then to—that’s yesterday.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
then today, we have a monetary policy go-round, all the way around the table—everyone gives
their views.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the discussion around policy was—the majority view was, was still what it has
been, which is that inflation is running above target, maximum employment is right at target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That means policy, policy should be a little bit restrictive, somewhat restrictive, because we
want—we want inflation to, to move all the way back to its target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s where people have
been and still are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Two of our members felt that the time had come to cut and that they—for the
reasons that they’re—they’re going to express.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I won’t tell you the reasons.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They—they’ll issue
some kind of a—of a thing in the next day or so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but that’s the story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would say, you
know, well argued, very thoughtfully argued all around the table, good arguments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you
know, it’s a situation where—an unusual situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is in—is in, you know, good
shape, but it’s an unusual situation where you have risks to both your employment mandate and
your inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the nature of a supply shock.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s probably not surprising that there
would be differences and different perspectives on that as well as different views of where the
Page 21 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
neutral rate is, so they—different views of how tight policy is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will say,
what you hope is that people, you know, explain their, their positions very thoughtfully and
clearly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we absolutely had that today all the way around the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would call it one of the
better meetings I can recall from that standpoint.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’ve said you’re waiting to be confident
inflation is heading toward your 2 percent target before you start cutting rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>When you do get
that confidence, would you be in—would you be in favor of lowering rates right away?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not, not quite the way I would put it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, I said that’s
why we think policy should, should be restrictive, is because, you know, inflation is above target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When we—when we have risks to both goals—one of them is farther away from goal than the
other, and that’s inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Maximum employment’s at goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you have to—that means policy
should be tight because tight policy is what brings inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you came to the view that
the risks to the two were more in balance, that would imply that policy shouldn’t be restrictive, it
should be more neutral—more, more, you know, a neutral stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that would be somewhat
lower than where we are now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one knows exactly where that is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—that’s the
framework I think I’d be taking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’ll just have to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be
obviously looking at a lot of data in the next cycle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It is one of the cycles where we have two
employment and two inflation reports, and we’ll see where that takes us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeff Cox.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEFF COX.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeff Cox from
CNBC.com.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A metric that you like to cite a lot is the final sales to private domestic purchasers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That was down to a 1.2 percent gain in the second quarter from 1.9 percent in Q1, suggesting
that there’s some softening in underlying demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just wondering if you look at that and you
Page 22 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
combine that with some of the housing numbers that—with the weakness that you acknowledge
at the top of your remarks—that the housing market is, in fact, weak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the inflation numbers
from GDP today came down 2.1 percent for headline, 2.5 percent for core.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering how
much more movement you would need to see from these data points before you would be
comfortable with cutting in, say, September.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s going to be the total—hard to answer that specifically.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>PDFP, I
think, for the first half—private domestic final purchases, or final sales, as people call it—was
1.6 on the first half.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>GDP, I believe, was 1.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s the whole half.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned
the quarters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those are slower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, GDP is bumpy quarter to quarter, half to half,
and often gets revised, you know, after the fact.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market data, we, we still think, is—
continue to think, is the best data we have on the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And that shows a 4.1 percent
unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It shows wages, you know, still at a healthy level, but moving ever closer to
what we would regard as long-run sustainable, consistent with longer-run productivity and
2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So the labor market is actually still quite solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Even ignoring tariffs, it’s a little bit above target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And tariffs—so we’re watching all of that and,
again, trying to—trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation, because you’re
being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
actually, at some point, if they’re—if they’re sort of equally at risk, then you really want to be at
a neutral policy stance, which we’re not right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’d be safe to say that, if the data kind of stays in line with where it is
right now, that you wouldn’t be comfortable with cutting in September?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not going to—I’m not going to say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I, I just think
we’re going to need to see the data, and it can go in many different directions—the inflation data
Page 23 of 24

July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and, and the employment data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll just—we’re going to make a judgment based on all of
the data and based on that balance-of-risks analysis that I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Greg Robb, for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Treasury
Secretary has said recently that it would be confusing for the markets if you stayed on as a
Governor after your term on the—as Chair ends.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was wondering if you had any update for
us on—a decision on that front.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, I do not have any update for you.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 18, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-
run objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more
to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports
ahead of potential tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Private
domestic final purchases, or PDFP, as we call them—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Within PDFP, growth
of consumer spending moderated, while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded
from weakness in the fourth quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a
decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook,
largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It remains to be seen how these developments might
affect future spending and investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median
participant projects GDP to rise 1.4 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year—somewhat
slower than projected in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged
135,000 per month over the past three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains
low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wage growth has continued to moderate
while still outpacing inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the
labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor
market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median projection for the
unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and next, a bit higher than
projected in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat
elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Estimates based on the consumer price index
and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May
and that—excluding the volatile food and energy categories—core PCE prices rose
2.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as
reflected in both market- and survey-based measures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Respondents to surveys of consumers,
businesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Beyond the next
year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our
2 percent inflation goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation this year is—is
3 percent, somewhat higher than projected in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median inflation projection falls to
2.4 percent in 2026 and 2.1 percent in 2027.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to determine the appropriate
Page 2 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies continue to evolve, and
their effects on the economy remain uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The effects of tariffs will depend, among other
things, on their ultimate level.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic
effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Even so, increases in tariffs this year
are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time shift in the price
level.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Avoiding
that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass
through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent
a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As we act to
meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are
in tension.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of
the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 3 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median projection projects—participant—median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this
year, the same as projected in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median projection declines to 3.6 percent at the end of
next year and to 3.4 percent at the end of 2027, a little higher than the March projection.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These
individual forecasts are always subject to uncertainty, and, as I have noted, uncertainty is
unusually elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We focused on issues related to assessing the risks and
uncertainties that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implications for policy
strategy and communications.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference that
we held last month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board
lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We intend to wrap up any
modifications to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy by late
summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>After that, we will consider enhancements to our suite of communications tools,
including the SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in
Page 4 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>To what extent
has the more limited impact from tariffs at this stage on inflation changed your view on what the
ultimate economic fallout will be from these policies and the timing of when they will
materialize in the data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ve had three months of, of favorable inflation readings since
the high readings of January and February, and that’s, of course, highly welcome news.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Part of
that just is that services, core services—both housing services and nonhousing services have
really been grinding down toward levels that are—that are consistent with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s the good news.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course, we
expect—as you—as you point out, we, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the
summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the
end consumer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A good example of that would be, goods being sold at retailers today may have been
imported several months ago—before tariffs were imposed—so we’re beginning to see some
effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we do expect to see more of them over coming months.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We do—we do also see
price increases in some of the relevant categories like personal computers and audio-visual
equipment—things like that that are attributable to tariff increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, we look at
surveys of businesses, and there, there are many of those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you, you do see a range of
things, but, but many, many companies do expect to—to, to put all or—some or all of the effect
Page 5 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of tariffs through to the next, next person in the—in the chain and, ultimately, to the consumer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today—you know, the amount of these—the, the amount of the tariff effects, the size of the
tariff effects, their duration, and the time it will take are all highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that is why
we think the appropriate thing to do is to hold where we are as we learn more, and we think our
policy stance is, is in a good place—where we’re well positioned to react to incoming
developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So in terms of how we should interpret the rate cuts penciled into the
SEP, is this reflecting that there’s this expectation that underlying inflation will just stay well
enough contained that allows the Committee to eventually move ahead with those cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or is it
about, you know, responding to a deterioration in economic activity, let’s say?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, how
should we make sense of the forecast?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if you look at the forecast, you will see that people do generally
expect inflation to move up and then to come back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we can’t just assume that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Of
course, we don’t know that, and, you know, our, our job is to make sure—one of our jobs—to
make sure that a one-time increase in inflation doesn’t turn into an inflation problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And that,
again—that will depend on the size of the effects, how long it takes for them to come in, and,
and, ultimately, on, on keeping inflation expectations anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, and thanks, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with
Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at the, the rate path starting in December to today and adjust it over the full
time horizon you’ve got there, you’ve taken about ¼ point per year out of your projected path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you end at a higher rate in end-2027 than you were—would have in the prior forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is
that a result of, of a sense that tariffs will lead to more persistent inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it a result of
Page 6 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
reassessments of where your short-term neutral rate is?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it—why, why are you on a slower
path now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would focus most on the—on the nearer term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you think—as
you get out to the—to the later years, it’s hard to—it’s hard for anybody to know where the
economy is going.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You didn’t see people moving their longer-term, you know, estimate of the
neutral rate, for example, at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and those things are probably slow moving.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
think—I think if you look at what’s happening here since March—this is since March, right?—</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>you see a little slower growth, just a tiny tick up, one-tenth tick up, in, in unemployment, and
you see inflation moving up three-tenths.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And by the way, it was—it was a similar move from
the December SEP to the March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what you see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see the, the effects of tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
think we learned in April, after the March meeting, that substantially higher tariffs were likely,
and then since then, the estimates of where the tariffs will be have actually moved back down,
although still at an elevated level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re adapting in real time, and what you see is, you
know, an, an accumulation of individual assessments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, but you say in the statement that risks have diminished
on that front, but the July 9, you know, drop-dead date for all the, the Liberation Day tariffs is
still out there and unresolved.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got now an exchange of missiles between two Middle
East adversaries, with a possible U.S. involvement—how can you justify saying that risks have
diminished?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what we said was that uncertainty has, has—uncertainty about the
economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Many, many surveys say that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and, and, that’s—that’s actually a line from the Tealbook, which you can see in five years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember to check that. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Maybe the world will be over by then. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter]
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No—but if you think of that, tariff uncertainty—uncertainty really
peaked in April and since then has come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s—that’s really what that’s just
acknowledging.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s diminished but still elevated—that it’s uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that’s an
accurate statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There is
an argument out there in favor of cutting rates more immediately.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has continued to cool
and is back at roughly 2 percent, despite the tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I guess I also wanted to ask about, you
know, cracks in the job market, with gross hiring slowing—concentrated in just a few industries.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen some housing data, including this morning, that have been pretty weak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you see
any concerns that, you know, the economy is weakening and that is a reason to cut rates going
forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we do—we do, of course, monitor all those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I think if
you look at the overall picture, you know, what you’re seeing is 4.2 percent unemployment and
an economy that’s growing at a—at a rate hard to know, given the, the unusual flows in the first
quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it appears to be 1½, 2 percent—maybe a little better than that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sentiment has come
up off of its very low levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s still—it’s still depressed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, you can—you can
point to things—the housing market is a longer-run problem and also a short-run problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
don’t think it’s indicative of—you know, basically, the situation is, we have a longer-run
shortage of housing, and we also have high rates right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the best thing we can do for
the housing market is to restore price stability in a sustainable way and, and create a strong labor
market, and that’s the best thing we can do for the housing market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You asked about the job
Page 8 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
market—again, look at labor force participation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look at wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Look at job creation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re
all at healthy levels now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I would say you can see perhaps a very, very slow continued
cooling, but nothing that’s troubling at this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we watch it—we watch it very,
very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, overall, again, the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well
positioned to respond in a timely way to economic developments, and—for now—and we’ll be
watching the data carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Well, just quickly on—given that, you know, there are
concerns inflation will rise—but there is the alternate scenario that tariffs would create demand
destruction and slow growth sufficiently and that would perhaps keep a bit of a lid on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do you see odds of that scenario, what kind of odds do you see of that scenario coming true, and
how many months of cool inflation would you need to see before concluding that maybe that
lower-inflation scenario is taking place?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is very much the conversation we had today and yesterday.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There, there are many, many different scenarios—many combinations of scenarios where
inflation does or doesn’t prove out to be at the levels we think and where the labor market does
or doesn’t soften.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think what, what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of
very high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one holds
these, these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they’re all
going to be data dependent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that—you can make a case for, for any of the rate paths, I
think, that you see in, in the SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we do this once a quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—it’s a hard
thing to do at this—particularly at this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But it does reflect—you know, if you see somebody
writing down, you know, a, a rate path that involves cuts, that’s them saying, “Yes, I think we
will get to a place, more likely than not, where cuts will be appropriate.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it could be—it
Page 9 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
could be a joint probability of a number of possible outcomes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, remember how much
uncertainty we face, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chair, I wonder if you could describe for us some
of those scenarios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you get to a place—I’m noticing that the uncertainty levels in your
forecast are very high.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>How do you get to a place where you have the confidence in the outlook
for—say, inflation and/or growth or the unemployment rate—how many months does it take, and
what do you want to see in the data to get to that level of confidence to actually reduce rates off
the restrictive level?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s—it’s—again, it’s very, very hard to say when that will
happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that the time will come; it come—could come quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could not come
quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As long as the economy is solid, though—as long as we’re seeing the kind of labor
market that we have and reasonably decent growth and inflation moving down, we feel like the
right thing to do is to be where we are, with where our policy stance is, and just learn more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
in particular, we feel like we’re going to learn a great deal more over the summer on tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
do—we hadn’t expected them to show up much by now, and they haven’t, and we will see
whether—the extent to which they do over, over coming months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think that’s going to
inform our thinking, for one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, we’ll see how the labor market progresses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So,
at some point, it will become clear.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can’t tell you exactly when that will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know,
meanwhile, we’ll be watching, watching the labor market very carefully for signs of weakness
and strength and tariffs for signs of, of what’s going to happen there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, there are
many developments ahead, you know, even in the near term—developments are expected on
tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we, we don’t yet know with any confidence where they will settle out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
Page 10 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have an estimate, and it’s a pretty—I think all estimates are now pretty close together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s—
it’s, yeah, highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When you say “estimate”—estimate of the impact of tariffs on the
core PCE—is that what it is?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And can you share that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, what you start with is, is—what’s the effective tariff rate
overall?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And people are managing to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, the, the pass-through of tariffs to
consumer price inflation is a whole process that’s very uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, as you know, there
are many parties in that chain: There’s the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer,
and the consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to, to pay for the
tariff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But together, they will all pay for it together—or maybe one party will pay it all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that
process is very hard to predict, and we haven’t been through a situation like this, and I think we
have to be humble about our ability to forecast it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s why we need to see some actual data
to have—to make better decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we’d like to get some, some more data, and, and, again,
in the meantime, we can do that because the economy remains in solid condition.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, I guess I’m
wondering if you could explain a little more the divergence we see in the dot plot, particularly
around the 2025 rate projections.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I realize this is—you know, you have one group of officials
that are putting down no cuts, another that are putting down more than one—and recognizing
that could be difficult to summarize, but is it a matter of people having a different outlook or a
different reaction function?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>A different commitment to defending against another inflation
mistake?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How, how did that play out over the last two days?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 11 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right, we—and, as is often the case, we have a pretty
healthy diversity of views on the Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We did have strong support for today’s decision
and broad agreement that our policy stance does leave us in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would point to
two factors, and you mentioned them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The first is just that parties have a diversity of forecasts,
and, and they do align with, with where—with where their dots are.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if you have a higher
inflation forecast, you’re going to be less likely to be writing down, you know, more, more cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But as—remember, as we see more data, we’re going to learn more about where inflation is
headed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that means when it is time to look at, at normal—at sort of, at, you know—
resuming our normalization process, the differences you may—you see should be smaller
because we’ll have seen actual data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Right now, it’s just a forecast in a very foggy time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s the first part—is forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Secondly, people can look at the same data, and they can evaluate the risks differently, as
you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that includes, you know, the, the risk of higher inflation, the risk it’ll be more
persistent, the risk that the labor market will weaken—people are going to have different
assessments of that risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you put that in there, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those are the two ways that, that—the
two things, I think, that drive these things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember, though, with—as I mentioned earlier—
with uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with a lot of conviction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
that’s really where it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a function of those things, and I think as the data come in, you
should see those differences diminish.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up—you’ve said the policy is in a good place, and
that it’s modestly restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given all the uncertainty—you just talked about tariff levels,
uncertainty around the pass-through—is it price increases versus margin compression?—some of
Page 12 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the softness that Chris talked about in, in labor and housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why wouldn’t it be better to have
rates at a more neutral setting as the economy heads into this period of very high uncertainty?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if you just look backward at the data, that, that’s what you would
say, but that’s not—we have to be forward looking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the thing that every forecaster—every
outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to
arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think a backward-looking
look would, would lead you to a neutral stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we, we can’t—we have to—we have to look
at that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what’s going
to happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It, it’s, you know, the—there’s a range of possibilities on how, how large the, the
inflation effects and the other effects are going to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll make smarter and better decisions
if we just wait a couple of months or however long it takes to get a sense of, of really what, what
is going to be the pass-through of inflation and what’re—what’s going to be the effects on
spending and on hiring and all those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your
friend down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue continues to lob insults in your direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m
wondering, given now that the Supreme Court has maybe carved out the Fed from some of the
legal implications of that, whether this is just noise that the markets and everybody should ignore
until your term is up or whether you worry that it could lead to more pressure on confidence on
Wall Street—on consumers—about the outlook for the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, from my standpoint, it’s—it’s not complicated.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What
everyone on the FOMC wants is a good, solid American economy with a strong labor market
and, and price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we want.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think our policy is well positioned to—right
Page 13 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now to, to deliver that and, and to be able to respond in a timely way as the data lead us around.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy’s been resilient, and part of that is our stance, and, again, we think we’re—we’re
in a good place on that to respond to significant economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what matters.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is what matters to us—pretty much, that’s all that matters to us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I need to ask—assuming you are not reappointed, would you stay
on as Governor when your term as Chair ends?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m—I’m not thinking about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m thinking about this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess with workplace raids
increasing, picking up significantly—what kind of effect would that have on the labor market in
the short term?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, sorry—with what picking up?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Workplace raids.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Ah, ah, immigration—so you’re asking immigration?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, you know—I, I wouldn’t want to speculate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What—one way
to get at that from an economic standpoint—we, of course, don’t comment on immigration
policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not ours to make or comment on.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But what you see is a—an, an unemployment rate
that has been really solid and at a low level—not really increasing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s been in a—in a good
range and well within the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that
means, like, part of that is that labor demand and labor supply are kind of moving down at the
same rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Labor demand is, is softening—you see that in job creation—but it’s still kind of at a
healthy level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And labor supply is, is diminishing because the, the immigration numbers that we
Page 14 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see are, are much lower than they were.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So the—those two factors, supply and demand—that’s
what has kept the, the unemployment rate in a reasonably, you know, stable place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Okay, thanks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The other thing I wanted to follow up on is if
you could—if you could elaborate on the potential changes to the SEP that you suggested were
part of the framework review, I think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the framework review really has two tracks, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The first track
is our—is our policy framework.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that is reflected in the consensus statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we,
we’ve said that we would finish that and announce it by the end of the summer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re well
along in that process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve had the meetings that we need to have, and we’re now going to be
going into [cough]—pardon me—into discussions about, you know, specific changes to
language.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s—that’s the framework part of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The second part of it is our
communications tools and practices [cough]—pardon me—and that, that part comes next, okay?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’re going to do in the meetings this fall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Actually, what we did at this meeting,
though, is we, we sort of prepared the ground for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We had a—we had a meeting where we
talked at a high level about a number of ideas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The SEP is part of it—you know, other—many, many other ideas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—it’s sort of—
how do we think our communications can be improved?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are a number of ideas.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People
offered a really—it was a great conversation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Number of ideas—but we’re—we’re going to look
at those with staff briefing and a lot of thought in the fall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would say, when it comes to
changing communications, you know, I would only do—I would only support things really that
only—implement things that have very broad support.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, you want to be really careful,
because I think our communications are pretty well received.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re not broken, so more is not
Page 15 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
necessarily better—but better is better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re going to be looking at ways to do—to do things
that will improve the clarity of what we do for the benefit of, of the public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KELLY O’GRADY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly O’Grady, CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re
famously known as the guy that makes decision based on data instead of speculation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You’ve
said today in—the inflation data is in a good place—we don’t know how tariffs are going to
impact prices going forward—that’s uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I’ve got to go back to the last time that you
cut rates in December, and there was still the what-if of tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So what made you feel
comfortable cutting then, when inflation was higher than where it is today—and you didn’t cut
today?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, the, the forecast for inflation in December was 2½ core PCE
for 2025—the forecast was 2½ percent—which is a good inflation forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think what we’ve
learned is that—and this was long before we had any idea of what the actual policies would be.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’ve learned the tariffs are going to be substantially larger than, than forecasters generally
thought.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we, we don’t—our, our forecasts are generally not particularly
different from those of other, you know, well-resourced forecasting operations.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So what we
learned—and particularly in April—was that substantially larger tariffs were coming and that
that would mean higher inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so you—now you see—you saw
2½ percent forecast in December.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You saw 2.8 percent in March, and you see 3.1 percent now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s six-tenths higher inflation for 2025, and that’s—that’s a big part of, of the change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s—that’s due to the effects of, of the tariffs that are—you know, we, we don’t know where
Page 16 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
they’re going to land, but it’s pretty apparent they’re going to land higher than outside
forecasters were really guessing at the end of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My follow-up to that—I think consumers—right?—were looking
for relief on rates when it comes to mortgages—car loans.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Small businesses want to take out
more manageable loans.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>When you look at the cumulative inflation over the past five years,
prices have risen over 20 percent—it’s been a rough road.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what is the tipping point, then, for
the wait-and-see approach in terms of how much it’s going to help versus when it hurts the
American consumer?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Well, I mean, we’re trying to restore price—the best thing we can do
for the—for the public that we serve is restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If we can, and we will, restore
price stability, meaning 2 percent inflation on a durable, sustainable basis—that and also
maximum employment—and if we, we restore those things, that’s the best thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that is our
goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The best thing we can do for the American people—for, for households and businesses—
that is the ultimate thing that we can deliver.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they can make their decisions without having
to think about inflation all the time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, in the meantime, we have to keep rates high to keep—to
get inflation all the way down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re not very high—let’s be honest.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say policy is
modestly or moderately—probably modestly now—restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at the economy, it’s
not performing as though it were performing under very strict monetary policy—very restrictive
monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I would say probably modestly restrictive—and so what it will take is, is
confidence that inflation is coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, I would say, without tariffs, that confidence would be building because if you—if
you see what’s happening with nonhousing services and housing services, which are the other
two big pieces other than goods, those are coming down really nicely now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we have to
Page 17 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
learn a little more about, about tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know—I don’t know what the right way for us to
react will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s hard to know with, with any confidence how we should react until we
see, really, the size of the effects—then we can start to make a better judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So that’s what
we’re doing, and I think we can—we can take the time to do that, because unemployment is
4.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wages are moving up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Real wages are moving up at a—at a healthy clip now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
inflation is, you know—2.3 percent headline inflation over a 12-month basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s a good
economy, and a solid economy with decent growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re saying that uncertainty
has come down, the economy is moving at a solid pace, inflation has come down over the past
three months, and this is all moving in the right direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So are you indicating here that
Americans should expect some sort of economic pain in the second half of the year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not—I’m not saying that at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, from our standpoint,
what I can say is that the, the U.S. economy is in solid shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The
unemployment rate remains at 4.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, real wages are moving up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a—
it’s a good—job creation is at a healthy level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Unemployment, again, as I said, low—labor force
participation at a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What we’re waiting for to reduce rates is, is to understand what
will happen with, with, really, the tariff inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there’s a lot of uncertainty about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Every forecaster you can name who, you know—who is a professional, you know, forecaster
with, with adequate resources and forecasts for a living is forecasting, you know, a pretty
significant—everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming
months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it will be someone in that
chain that I mentioned: Between the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer—
Page 18 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
ultimately, somebody putting it into a, a good of some kind or just the consumer buying it—and,
you know, all through that, that chain, people will be trying not to be the ones who, who pick up
the cost.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And some of it will fall on the end
consumer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that because that’s what businesses say—that’s what the, the data say from
past—so we know that’s coming.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we just want to see, see a little bit of that before we make
judgments prematurely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And follow-up on that—so you’ve spent years, though,
talking about how, how you’re data dependent, and be a little more direct on this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
now you’re making decisions looking forward—doesn’t the data you’re seeing today indicate
there should be a rate cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, I mean, you’re—monetary policy has to be forward looking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is elementary.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve got to be looking—I always—we always talk about the incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We say that over and over and over again,
right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s always forward looking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, if you know—at the very beginning of the
pandemic, you know, we cut rates to zero immediately.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nothing had happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just knew
that it was going to be really bad, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we took very aggressive forward looking—because
we knew things were going to be unusually difficult.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, of course, this, this is something we,
we sort of know is coming—we just don’t know the size of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, again, the economy seems to
be in solid shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the labor market’s not crying out for a rate cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Businesses, you know,
were in a bit of shock after April 2.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you see business sentiment—you talk to business people
now—there’s a very different feeling now that people are working their way through this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
they, they understand how they’re going to go, and it’s—it, it feels much more positive and
Page 19 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
constructive than it did three months ago, let’s say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, again, we think that our current stance of
monetary policy is in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Amara.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>AMARA OMEOKWE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell,
in February, you told Congress that the Fed is “overworked, maybe, not overstaffed.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then, in a
memo to—a memo to staff in May announcing a deferred resignation program at the Fed, you
said you wanted to ensure that the Fed was “right-sized.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those two statements appear to be at
odds with one another.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you explain what changed in the roughly three months between
those statements that made you decide that staff levels at the Fed should decline?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t see them at all as, as in tension.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, so I was asked,
“Is the Fed overstaffed?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I said, “No.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, and I sort of said as a pun,
“Overworked, but not overstaffed.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People do work extremely hard at the Fed, and I know they
work hard at Bloomberg, too. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter] So—but we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We work hard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would say
this—so we are careful stewards of public resources, and sometimes you need to show that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
there’ve been several times in our history—modern history—where the Fed has said, “You know
what?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to do a buyout.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to—going to show the public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to
demonstrate that we are good stewards of public resources.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we thought—and I, I thought—
that this is a time when we can.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ve—we grow about—our headcount has grown
at about 1 percent a year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So over the course of a couple of years, we’re going to—we’re doing a
careful scrub of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks, and we’re going to find 10 percent of
employees who can do something else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where, where we can—we can streamline our operations—and we, we think we can get
there in a year, in a couple of years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think we can do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think the—we think the,
Page 20 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the—this is, this is without taking risk to carrying out our critical missions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is something
you do very carefully—thoughtfully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you do it, again, respecting that we have critical
missions to carry out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ve had experience—a lot of experience—in my prior careers, you know,
with headcount reductions and things like that, and this is how you do it professionally.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You do
it carefully—thoughtfully—with a lot of planning, and you do it over a period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I
think it’s—I think the Fed will be fine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think no one will notice any decline in our ability to
carry out our missions, and I think it’s just us wanting to demonstrate to the public that we are
actually good stewards of their—of their resources.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re—we’re effectively wiping out
10 years of headcount growth with this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I mean, we just—we wanted to show that, you
know—that we’re good stewards.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How is progress on reducing the headcount going so far?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are
you on track to meet the goal?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re just at the very beginning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you know, we’re doing a
buyout program.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to—we’re going to hit that goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think many organizations find
that they can—that they can do this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You don’t want to do it every year or anything, but you can
do it at intervals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you, you wind up not, you know—not interfering with your ability to
perform your jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, Claire Jones from the Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As you’re no
doubt aware, the Senate Finance Committee has tabled its version of the reconciliation bill this
week, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the tenor of the debate at the
FOMC over the past few days on fiscal policy and the degree to which that influenced people’s
projections for 2026 and beyond.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 21 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so, you know, we don’t—we don’t sit around and debate or
really discuss—we, we take fiscal policy as fully exogenous.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we, we actually, you know,
really didn’t talk about, about the bill or the contents of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s still evolving.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, when,
when it gets close—closer—remember also we have a very, very large economy, and that the
effects will be at the margin.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I, I expect that they’ll—they may already be in—
but they will be in by the next meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll make an estimate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s not a major thing; it’s
nothing that we discuss.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It, it may have been mentioned a couple of times—but as something
that’s coming in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think the outcome is—you know, we don’t know the outcome yet
there—so, hard to be real specific.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’ve been some
cutbacks in economic statistics collection in the last few weeks—worries that long-running
problems around funding and response rates may be getting worse.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much is this concern on
your radar?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much confidence do you have that the gauges you’re watching to assess the
economy are reliable right now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, two things—one, the data we get right now—we, we can
do our jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not concerned that we can’t do our jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not the—that’s not the point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The point, really, is that we are starting to see, you know, layoffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and important gatherers
of data are saying that they’re—they’re having to cut back on the size of their surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
going to lead to more volatility in the surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we should take a step back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, from our standpoint—and I think the standpoint of businesses and governments and
everyone—having really good data on the state of the economy at any given time is a huge
public good.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It helps.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t just help the Fed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It helps the government, it helps Congress, it
Page 22 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
helps the executive branch.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>More importantly, really, it helps businesses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They need to know
what’s going on in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The United States has been a leader for many, many years in
this whole project of measuring and understanding what’s happening in, in our very large and
dynamic economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I hate to see—I hate to see us cutting back on that because it, it is a real benefit to
the general public that people in all kinds of jobs have the best possible understanding of what’s
happening in the economy and, and, hence, what’s likely to happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very hard to measure
what’s going on in the U.S. economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If, if you read—there was a book called—well, it’s really
remarkable how many things you need to understand to estimate U.S. GDP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Very, very
difficult—and it’s so important that we get it right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just would—I just would say it’s not a
place to—I would want to keep investing in that, you know, for the good of the general public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re conducting this
monetary policy strategy framework review, but next year we’re supposed to have a new Fed
Chair, and I’m wondering if that affects at all the way that you’re approaching this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you
ensure that this framework will actually be durable?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the framework goes back to—the framework document
goes back to 2012, and it’s—it’s the Committee’s document.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not like we’re going to invent a
brand new way to do things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—it’s been an evolving document, so it shouldn’t depend on
who the Chair is at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It should depend on what’s happening in the economy and what the
Committee wants to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, yeah, it isn’t really tied to any particular Chair, and, you know, we
used to renew it every year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now we do it every five years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but I, I don’t think anybody—
I’ve never heard anyone raise this issue that, you know, a new Chair might want to come in and
Page 23 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
go in a completely different direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I really—I really don’t think that’s right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know,
that’s not—not going to be up to me to decide.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that affecting at all that you’re—who you’re consulting with—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, not at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not in any way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MATT EGAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Matt Egan from CNN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Relatively low gas
prices this year have helped drive down inflation in recent reports, but that trend is starting to
reverse, given the crisis in the Middle East.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How are you thinking about how the Israel–Iran
conflict will impact the economy, especially inflation, and what lessons were learned during the
2022 period when another conflict, the Russia–Ukraine war, sent oil and gas prices
skyrocketing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, of course, we’re watching—like everybody else is—what’s going
on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I really don’t have any comment on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, possible that, that we’ll see higher
energy prices—what’s tended to happen is, when there’s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see
a spike in energy prices—but tends to come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those things don’t generally tend to have
lasting effects on inflation, although, of course, in the 1970s, they famously did, because you had
a series of very, very large shocks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we haven’t seen anything like that—that—like that now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The U.S. economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, but—
MATT EGAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A quick follow-up—I’ve just got to ask you about artificial intelligence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some technology executives have recently been warning that AI could wipe out a large chunk of
entry-level jobs and significantly increase the unemployment rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m wondering how
concerned you are, if at all, about the threat that AI poses to employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 24 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question really is, will AI be more
augmenting labor or replacing labor?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I wouldn’t—I, I—we all see those announcements,
including one today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t overread a, a couple of data points, because, you know, AI
should be creating jobs at the same time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may be replacing—it may be doing both.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Anyone
who’s done any work with it—with AI—will, will have been a little bit stunned at how capable it
is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s just a different thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think this is something that certainly has transformational
potential—and probably we’re in the very early stages of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They say what you’re seeing now
compared to what you’ll see in two years is, is going to be very different and even more
effective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s really hard to know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, of course, there are optimists who feel
like it’s going to make everybody much more, you know—much more productive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there are
those who think it’s going to replace an awful lot of jobs right across the income spectrum—you
know, white collar, blue collar, and everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I just don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t—we don’t have
a “house view” on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But this is—this is going to be a very important question for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was wondering if you
could step back a little bit, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, there’s a spate of articles and a lot of op-
eds now in the newspapers saying that the U.S. economy and the global economy is going
through this profound change, you know, akin to the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And don’t you owe the American people, like, some sort of, like, explanation for what we’re
going through?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I, I noticed earlier this month when you, you talked about Bretton
Woods a little bit, and you said that Bretton Woods—the Fed staff had to, like, change how
they’ve—the dollar—movements of the dollar was impacting the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are we going
Page 25 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through something like that now—that, you know—are you having to change how you do
monetary policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it—is it that fundamental of a change under way?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—it’s certainly a time of real change—you know, from a
geopolitical standpoint, from a trade standpoint, from an immigration standpoint—you see this
not just here, but everywhere.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s—there’s quite a lot going on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t change the
way we do monetary policy in the near term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, but—and it doesn’t change our objectives
or what we need to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, these, these things are not really our issues—they’re
really issues for elected governments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All of those issues are really for elected governments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But there’s no question it’s a time of, of real, real change—and very hard to see where that goes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Will it be—there have been many, many things written about how it’s going to be a more
inflationary time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s possible; it’s not guaranteed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, AI could cut in a very other
direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>AI could make people much more productive and—and push in the other direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
don’t know, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you’re right, but, honestly, our focus is, is a much more practical one,
and that is, how do we keep inflation low and, and employment high in the near term?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s
really what we’re about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mark Hamrick.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MARK HAMRICK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hello, Chairman Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mark Hamrick with
Bankrate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What is the view about the growing amount of slack in the job market, including the
softening in payrolls, the forecast of a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and the ability of
workers to demand wage hikes or not in this environment where you have inflation surging?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I don’t, you don’t see—you don’t really see unemployment going up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You don’t see increased slack, really—I mean, at the margin.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Remember, you’re at 4.2 percent
unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that was for many, many years—that was an extremely low level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
Page 26 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens to have come up off of an even lower level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we came out of the pandemic, we were
as low as 3.4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But 4.2 percent is probably at the low end of estimates of the longer-run,
you know, sustainable level of natural rate of unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t—I guess I wouldn’t
agree with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, in terms of wages—you know, real wages after inflation have been
moving up sort of more than was consistent with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re still moving up at
a—at a healthy clip—and I think much more consistent with 2 percent inflation, given, given a, a
reasonable assessment of, of trend productivity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s a pretty good labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
you’re right that the level of job creation has come down, but so has the supply of workers—the
change in the supply—the, the new supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you’ve seen—you’ve seen the unemployment rate remain pretty stable at 4.2.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
been as high as 4.3, but, you know, those are—those are good numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s a pretty good
labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s—the thing is, there’s—a more concerning thing is, there’s not—there are
not a lot of layoffs, but there are not a lot of, of job creation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The number—if you’re out of
work, it’s—it’s hard to find a job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But very few people are being laid off at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So
that’s—an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully, because if there were to be, you know,
significant layoffs and the job-finding rate were to remain this low, you would have a lot—you
would have an increase in unemployment fairly quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that hasn’t happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It really
hasn’t happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re—so the U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to, to
weaken, really, over the last three years, and it’s been remarkable to see—just again and again
when people think it’s going to weaken out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Eventually it will, but we don’t see signs of
that now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go to Jean for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 27 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s been a lot
of talk about cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wanted to ask you—why do you think there are no forecasts for rates to rise
or, or even to stay where they are next year, given that the projection for inflation is to rise to
3 percent and there’s a lot of—there’s some skepticism over whether those price hikes will be a
one-time event?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there are a number of people on the Committee who wrote down
no cuts this year but some cuts next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, look, I think, you know, people are writing down
their most likely path, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re not saying there’s zero possibility of other things, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Really, it’s—think of it as the least unlikely path in a situation like this where uncertainty is very
high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think—again, people write—they write down their, their rate paths, and they do not
have, like, a really high conviction that this is exactly what’s going to happen over the next two
years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one feels that way about their rate path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They feel like, “What am I going to write
down?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, what would you write down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not easy to, to be—to do that with
confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would just say it that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t rule things in or out—certainly, a hike is not
the base case at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not something people are writing down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, in the meantime, we do the
best we can with these forecasts, and I, I think they’re—they’re representative of, you know, of
the different forecasts and different reaction functions that people on the Committee have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So thank you very much.</del></p>

<h2>Common sentences</h2>
<p class="hawkish">Good afternoon.</p>
<p class="neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position.</p>
<p class="dovish">The
unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</p>
<p class="dovish">In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged.</p>
<p class="hawkish">We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us
well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</p>
<p class="dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.</p>
<p class="hawkish">At this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review
of our monetary policy framework.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</p>
