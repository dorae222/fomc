Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 26, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and
we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve covered a lot of
ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Looking ahead, we will
continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Although activity
in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear
to be weighing on business fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, job gains averaged
244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are some continuing signs that supply and
Page 1 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has
moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>While the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of
available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the 12 months
ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In June, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, the process
of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Despite elevated inflation,
longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our
mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are also continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With today’s action, we’ve raised our
Page 2 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have been seeing the effects of our
policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy,
particularly housing and investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It will take time, however, for the full effects of our
ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, the economy is
facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely
to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 28

STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You have, I think a couple of times in
your opening remarks, talked about this language “in determining the extent of additional policy
firming that may be appropriate.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on
the way?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And should we also believe that all future meetings—say, September and November—
are live, or are you in an every-other-meeting mode?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not
something we’ve looked at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into
each meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we haven’t made any
decisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you
read the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations:
Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the
June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the June CPI
report, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We hope that
inflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we
don’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, what are we going to be looking at?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader
picture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re looking for supply
and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the
labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ll be looking at inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole
collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if we
make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how we’re thinking about
Page 4 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the next meeting and, you know, how we’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially,
but, you know, we’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we
get two more job reports, two more CPI reports.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think we have an ECI report coming later this
week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say it
is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant
it, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re
going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying
we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Monetary policy,
we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there: You
said the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that
mean there’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that
two more hikes are necessary?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m just going to go back to what I said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we—you know, that’s
the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I
recited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it really—we
did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s just one reading, as
everybody knows.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Many
forecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we
see the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll be focusing on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEANNA SMIALEK.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ve
seen the Barbie movie numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this
summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does seem like
growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I wonder, from your
perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know,
performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’s inflationary, or is it good news
because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just how are you thinking about that sort
of trajectory?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the
economy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any
meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a
good thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s good to see that, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence
coming up and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That will support activity going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you’re, you’re
right, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that
would require an appropriate response for monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll be watching that carefully
and seeing how it evolves over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MICHELE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin from Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as you referenced
earlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look
good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you’re data dependent, why not pause again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why not stay on hold?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why not take
another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if you go back to what we’re trying to do here, we’re trying to
achieve a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At
the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that would take—of what that would
take, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say, we looked at
the interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent,
but broadly consistent with expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as a result, we went ahead and, and took another
step.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but, but gradually
slowing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but, you
know, we’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from, from a single reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how we look at it, and, and so
we did take that step today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, markets
widely believe the median FOMC participant’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter
of this year will be too high, given autos and shelter, and that by September, that may warrant a
downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Would that type of inflation
progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below-trend growth and
decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you’ve done enough?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of
this and how much of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ll be looking at everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’ll, of
course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the
opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be looking at the growth
data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall
Page 7 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on, on
making progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If I could follow up: Last month you said there were benefits to
moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that
slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
September, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots
of activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision
then.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that
we decide to maintain at that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves
is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if we
get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee—
then we will move ahead.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining
policy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just
don’t have it yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So consumer
confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of, of the declines in headline
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long
time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of
3 percent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side
of the dual mandate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 8 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I’d say it this way: First, it is—it is a good thing that
headline inflation has come down so much, because that’s really what the public experiences.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a—it
will strengthen the broad sense that, that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will
in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you are really—sorry, your question
was?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I mean, you’ve talked for many press conferences
now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So how much of that are we
still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I would put it this way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s
really a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too
little?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there
really are risks on both sides.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not,
but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do
increasingly face that risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down
that far, you know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better
signal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by
volatile energy and food prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because
that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And
core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s reason to think it can come down now,
but it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re
Page 9 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And we need to
be prepared to raise further if that—if we think that’s appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, and then if inflation were to—just a quick
follow[up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in
unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People are talking
about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but how much?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment
rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So that’s a real
blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s not
that we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have
to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and
slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that is still the, the likely outcome here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we hope that that’s
as little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not
get it done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-
term social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is
volatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the—
that’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 10 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHAEL MCKEE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we
have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to
the downside.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now
under these conditions?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Do you think you might need to do more, because I’m curious about
what you see as inflation dynamics now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is the economy still moving in a direction where it
creates more inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have
some large labor settlements.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or is the economy disinflating, and you’re just, you’re able to go
back to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is,
we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to
demand and supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to
help ease inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand
balance, particularly in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And all of that should lead to declining inflationary
pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re
seeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are
telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have
its full desired effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that
inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further
tighten if that is appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long
way to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, do you think under current conditions you are restrictive
enough unless something changes?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 11 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I think—we think, you know, today’s rate hike was
appropriate, and I think we’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at
the next meeting about, is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if it does
tell us that—collectively, if that’s our view—then we will do more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If September is,
in fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace
that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the
June meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every
other meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could be two out of three meetings, right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could be—it just means if you’re
slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and
closer to, we think, our destination.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every
other meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment
where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes
all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so
that’s what we did.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I, I think it’s possible.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mentioned it before.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s possible that we
would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
really going to depend on what the data tell us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the best we can do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we shouldn’t assume that every other meeting is the lowest
tightening frequency, let’s say?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It could be, you know, longer intervals in between as well?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 12 of 28

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’re—look, I think we’re going to—we’re going to make a
decision about the next meeting, and then we’re going to make a decision about the one after
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think it’ll sort itself out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, among your
colleagues, there have been people who’ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken
place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it’s
happened very fast this time, and it’s kind of up to date.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Where are you on that continuum?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in
financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation,
right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our
decisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier
than it—than it used to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that
it has.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We know
that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and
variable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of
the lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>First, the first thing to say is, we’re
determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one should doubt that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would look at it this way, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The real federal funds rate is now
in meaningfully positive territory.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the
mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is
Page 13 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well above most estimates of the longer-term neutral rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would say, monetary policy is
restrictive, more so after today’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on
economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not
appropriate to do so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are resolutely
committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has proved,
repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at
some point, that may change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve
come, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the—on the credit side, I’m wondering if you saw
anything in the—in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’re getting a quantum of
credit contraction beyond what you’d expect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The bank lending data really is—the growth rate’s
edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession
indicator.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I
would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got
lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it,
it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s really hard to tease
out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the
overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS
will say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 14 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what
share of that credit you would give to factors that don’t stem directly from rate hikes or that
might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the
past year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, interesting question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me start by saying that the
inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and,
and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic
and the response from fiscal and monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve always expected that the
disinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-
related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which
would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think
that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down
sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a]
reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s, that’s a
good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both
factors, both that I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing
an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into
services and away from goods.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And take autos as an example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The combination of an increase in sales and inventories,
while, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s
Page 15 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also a role for demand, as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
they’re both working there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Housing services inflation now starts to move down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Clearly, higher
rates have, have slowed the housing market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I would say, monetary policy is
working about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward,
in particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market
will come in as a very, very important factor.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we think both of those—both of those sources
of disinflation are playing an important role.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources,
that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there a more even split
there, too?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward
because we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very
specific pandemic things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and
shortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be
important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>First, let me compliment your tie,
the choice of tie.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a good color.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So thanks for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the Beige Book, it
said, “Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably” for
manufacturing sectors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Is that an indication that there’s a, a wage inflation pressure?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And how
do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that
supply chains and, and shortages are easing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, what was the first part of it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, wage inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Like, how do you—how do you target
wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think what
we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what
we’re seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So wages have actually been gradually moving down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re still at levels what
would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, we’re making progress there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And by so many indicators, labor market demand is
cooling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can
look at the quits rate normalizing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can look at job openings coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You can look at
just job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it
was at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s actually not a bad thing, in
a sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is
really the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work,
getting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s
gradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want
to get.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But still we see a push to raise minimum wage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re seeing
a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is, they come out with
agreements like big pay increases, like UPS, and we have the autoworkers coming up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you
concerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contracts, pushing wage inflation
then?</strong></em></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Victoria.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask about the SEP,
which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under
3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so I’m wondering, is the level of inflation what’s sort of important there as you
think about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which
inflation is falling also important?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you’d take both into account.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you’d take everything
into account when you start cutting rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide
range of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just
is a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s
time to start cutting rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what
happens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there, what’s motivating people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if it’s sort of—sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you
wouldn’t necessarily cut rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not giving you any
numerical guidance around that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when
we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would be—you
know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the median was several for next
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,
Page 18 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and it’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is, in fact, coming down to our 2 percent
goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>STEVE MATTHEWS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the
Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing, and they’ve reduced their forecast for a
recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession
being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident
that you can achieve a soft landing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and
my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without
the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in
some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
been my view.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s still my view.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent
with, with what I see today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have
a lot left to go to see that happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the
forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a
recession.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is
independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Having an independent
staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our
process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make—
informs our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 19 of 28

STEVE MATTHEWS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and
you still have a strong labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, does that add to the optimism?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would—I would
say, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve,
we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s, that’s a really good thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s
very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And consistent with having a soft
landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still
likely as we—as we go forward with this process.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t—
we haven’t really seen that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher
unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the
way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen
participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the
temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it
continues.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You and other Fed
officials in the past have suggested that you don’t need to keep hiking until inflation hits
2 percent, that—as long as you see continued progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I’m wondering, how close do you
need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How many months of data do you need to
Page 20 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see that will—that will give you sufficient confidence, and how, how far does this fight need to
go before you’re willing to kind of declare victory on it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to
2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s
clearly not the appropriate way to think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we,
we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a
grain of salt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal
funds rate is at a restrictive level now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a
restrictive level anymore.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and
then below a neutral level at a certain point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we would, you know, we would—we, of
course, would be very careful about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming
down in a sustainable level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical
assessment of when and where that would be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d
start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before
you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation
until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.</strong></em></p>

comfortable saying that we’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this
point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And how does this play into your outlook for policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I
will say, things have settled down for sure out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Deposit flows have stabilized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Capital and
liquidity remain strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up
significantly year over year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, we’re still watching,
you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the
banking sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were,
were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more
affected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort
of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They may be
tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are
tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think—I think
we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—I think, basically,
we’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s,
that’s going to restrain economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is restraining economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how I
would look at it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And how is that informing your outlook for setting
policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 22 of 28

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we—that goes—that’s—an expected result of tightening
interest rate policy is that—is that bank credit conditions—bank lending conditions would
tighten as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened
in May?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just don’t think we know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’re looking at the current data in GDP, and
we’re seeing strong spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re seeing a strong economy, and it’s made us confident that
we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I—it
seems like the economy is weathering this well, but, of course, we’re watching it carefully and,
and expect to continue to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary
impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer
sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we’ve been seeing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that
increases in] real wages are positive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, that’s a great thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, we want that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
want people to have [gains in] real wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s
consistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages
have been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We expect to see more of
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We don’t really think
that, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I
would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Labor market conditions
broadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we
think we need some further softening in labor market conditions.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you
mentioned at the start how you’re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might
be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families
if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment
back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s the message there of, of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise
them?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get
inflation under control.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit
those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get
inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think that is the most
important thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away
are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or,
you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re
just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right
away.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People, people
on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we need—we need to
get this done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we
don’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater.</strong></em></p>

we’re doing.</strong></em></p>

the event, the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate
move that you announced today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The decision was, of course, unanimous, and the statement was
basically unchanged from last month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting
actually a live one?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision
was, was actually going to be?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I mean, you could—“Was there doubt?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Look, I would say
there’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks, you’ll
see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should
do at the next meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many times when we go
into a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, we have the
meeting, and some—some—some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others, and I’ll
just leave it at that.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>EVAN RYSER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Evan Ryser, Market News International.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks—the dollar, the
stock market, et cetera.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come
down to target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course,
very focused on rates and our own policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy
tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication
is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could
mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what tends to happen,
Page 25 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though, is, financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we’re doing, and, and,
ultimately, over time, we get where we need to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If I could also ask about the SEP from June that showed rate cuts—do
you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So that, that could happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question is, you know, is that
consistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world
where things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more
normal levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to
continue it, depending on where you are in the cycle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So they are two independent things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you can imagine circumstances
in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different
ways.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that wouldn’t be the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Kyle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KYLE CAMPBELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kyle Campbell with American Banker.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
have a question about the discount window.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering if, since the bank failures of the
spring, if you’ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that
they’re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether
policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to, to show that
they are prepared to use it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s a very important thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And yes to both sides of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window,
and we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We did find, as you know,
during the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It can be a little

clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So why not be in a situation where, where
you’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Mark Hamrick.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve talked in the
past about getting the housing market back into better balance—excuse me—and also that the
market might have bottomed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right
now, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might
otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and,
of course, also all of that happening with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage still around 7 percent
on the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’re talking about tightening industry lending
standards?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are we getting closer to balance or farther away?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s your sense?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the
reasons that you talked about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have
low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going
to because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing
homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>On the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and,
and there are people coming in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming
in, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think this will take some time to work through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Hopefully, more supply comes on line,
and, you know, we, we work through it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath
of the—of the pandemic.</strong></em></p>

watching that?</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 14, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from
credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as
likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that
economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Although growth in consumer
spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting
higher mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be
weighing on business fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Committee participants generally expect subdued
Page 1 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
growth to continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real
GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of
the longer-run normal growth rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, payroll job gains
averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate moved up but remained low
in May at 3.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth has shown signs of
easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>While the jobs-to-workers gap has
declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>FOMC
participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance
over time, easing upward pressures on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median unemployment rate projection in
the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the 12 months ending
in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In May, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation
has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue
to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next
year, and 2.1 percent in 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised
in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation
Page 2 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and price—and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage
points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It will take time,
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The extent of
these effects remains uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which
monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be
appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But at this meeting,
considering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range
steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary
Page 3 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path
for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario
going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the
appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent
at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For the end of this year, the median
projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I hasten to add, as
always, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the economy does not
evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our
2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Reducing
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum
employment and stable prices over the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 4 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m curious what
gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time
when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Interest rate–sensitive sectors like
housing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some
regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this
tightening cycle to address that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there
were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of
tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d
need to keep policy restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how
fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then last December,
after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point
hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to
our destination.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold
rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The main
issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may
be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the
ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may make
sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was
only about this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what
would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about
going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We really
were focused on what to do at this meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—
any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean,
of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But really, the focus was, was
on what to do today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been
made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I was just
wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s
been a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower
progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming
from?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not
coming from there.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Demand’s not coming down all that fast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>According to GDP—you’ve
doubled your, your estimate of GDP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what’s the—what’s the narrative here?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It seems like
it’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 26

CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent
with, but on the high side of, expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the
last SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved
up.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Unemployment estimates
moved down a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation estimates moved up a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, all three of those kind of
point in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint
will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So although the level, frankly, is, is
pretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected]
federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but so we’ve kind
of gone back to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come
from?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting
inflation down is going to be a gradual one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s going to take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I think you go
back to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think,
as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You start with goods.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>They’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will
say it’s not back to where it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that should enable goods
prices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and you are seeing
there that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s really a matter
of time as that goes through the pipeline.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In fact, I think any forecast that people are making
right now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and
Page 7 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and
that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come
into] effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of
the—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we see only the earliest
signs of disinflation there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say [that,]
in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s the service
sector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And I think many analysts would say that the key to
getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which
we have seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators
suggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We need to see that
continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation
down are, are coming into place.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below
trend.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would be a labor market that’s loosening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would be goods pipelines getting healthier
and healthier and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There, there—the things are in place that we need to see,
but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, what’s the
value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, not to be
flippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the
gym.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A majority of you
Page 8 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So why not just rip off the
Band-Aid and raise rates today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate
question from the question—from the—from, from that of level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and I think if you
look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our
individual estimates of how far to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In
terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far
away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common
sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every
meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if
only slightly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then there are benefits to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that gives us more information to make decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
may try to make better decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as
we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t
really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve
seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll have
some more time to see that unfold.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this
right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that
the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I know you said July is live.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With only one June employment—with
only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July
meeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some
Page 9 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
bank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be
using to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since
the last meeting, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll
really be a three-month period of data that we can look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think that’s a full quarter, and I
think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six-
week period.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll look at those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll look at
what’s happening in the financial sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and
we’ll make a decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEANNA SMIALEK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek, New York
Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down
the path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder, you
know, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient
and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And given that, you know, why do you feel
confident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or do you
think it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this
cycle?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following
the data and also the outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if
not all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s,
it’s just remarkable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s job
Page 10 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
creation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s wages moving up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting
hiring.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
it’s, it’s really the, the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these
meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s,
that’s how we do it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely
path of the economy is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there’s really no way to know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of
today, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
could wind up back in the same place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it really will be data driven.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I can’t—I can’t tell you
that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate
will be that far in advance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You had said back at
the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that still the
case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, could you give us
an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the—obviously, the current rate,
according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it 5.6?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it 6?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where is
sufficiently restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the
balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero
now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved
much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means
by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under,
Page 11 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
underdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I still think, and my, my colleagues
agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we don’t—we don’t think we’re
there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you look at the—at the full
range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of
progress over the last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you
know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that
inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s what we want to see—
of course that’s what we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are
lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the
tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to
think that some of that may come into effect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a
more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you
know, more—with more data over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering
when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would
expect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to
expect those lags to come into effect?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 12 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s
sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable
lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate
hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting
off—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of
where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where—
where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s
different.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very,
very quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But broader demand, and
spending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you
know, then that makes it challenging, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re,
we’re looking at what’s happening in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re having to make these judgments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate
pace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can’t point to
a specific data point.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really
flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s
working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we
need to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 13 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing
on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart
from these lag effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what
that might mean.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
you know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what
would normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that
into account on, on—in, in making rate decisions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s how we think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Chris.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHRIS RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You mentioned that
many of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>housing has come in
pretty low in the past couple of months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation
is now housing prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s
question: Why signal additional rate hikes?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why not simply give it even more time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the
dots, given what we’re seeing recently.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a
half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And forecasters, including Fed
forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know,
traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it
over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s running, and it’s running
Page 14 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know,
moving down.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We want to see it moving down decisively.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s all.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re, you know, of
course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we don’t want to do—we,
we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we just don’t see that
yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by
the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with
which we’re moving.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Quick follow-up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the last press conference you mentioned
you didn’t see wages driving inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there was some research from the San
Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you’ve talked about the
labor market today and the need for softening.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how
you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,
but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early
2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People
were still at home.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on
goods.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent,
supply chains got all snarled up.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So prices went way up.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation went way up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that was
the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But as you—as
you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that
it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing
Page 15 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with
2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—
and that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a
few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You said
in the past that you don’t like to surprise markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets
should have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You also said a number of
times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You reiterated that again today and that
we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should
look at your reaction function.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What will you be reacting to—time or data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In other words, if
nothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of
inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you
feel you need to?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal
in inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different
ways data might move.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of
our way to surprise markets or the public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting
the policy right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the
upcoming meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think you’ll, you’ll
see the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a—
make a judgment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down
based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or are we going to be in a
period where we’re not going to know what’s happening?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just
point you to the forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a
little higher than 4½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to
3.9 on a 12-month basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is by the end of this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline
for half a year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s the forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in
our reaction function.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s the
number-one thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Victoria.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you talk about the balance
sheet and how you’re thinking about it?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re
approaching reserve scarcity?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Also, are you
considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk
about that and then go back to the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on that—of course, we’ve been very
focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The] Treasury has laid out its
borrowing plans publicly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the
Page 17 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid
market disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the
borrowings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills
the, the TGA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP
facility and also in reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will
be—which will be greater.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for
that matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over
the course of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make
adjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was there another part of your question?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take
some pressure off banks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility]
doesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s actually been
shrinking here lately.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a
lot over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s—I
think it’s a tool that we have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we want to use it, we can.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are other tools we can—we can use to address money
market issues.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near
term.</del></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JONNELLE MARTE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Have you seen sufficient
cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For example, how does the recent
rebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place,
really, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by
higher rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We now see housing
putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re watching that situation carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I do think we—we will see rents,
rents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I don’t see them
coming up quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level
now, and that’s appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I think we, we look at everything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t just look at
housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices
all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely
forecasts—including their rate forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we
cumulate it, and then we publish it for you.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how—that’s how they do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself
going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Edward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward
Lawrence with Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I want to go back to comments you made about, in the past,
Page 19 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
about unsustainable fiscal path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in
10 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At what point do
you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Because—assuming monetary
policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level
spending.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s really not my job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—we hope and expect
that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we don’t see
ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will say, and many of my
predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be
addressed over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would
be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve
financing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Under no circumstances.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So looking at
the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so should we take that as
a sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least
more—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I—I would just say it this way.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I continue to think—and
this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent
without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve
Page 20 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seen in so many past instances.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that,
that gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I, I guess I want to
come back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We, we see—the Committee—
as you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation
down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is our
plan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in
the U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s
workers and families and businesses but also for the future.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Getting price stability back and, and
restored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it really is the bedrock
of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and you should understand that that is our top priority.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just a quick follow-up on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m just a little confused
because you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but
when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate
is lower than where it is now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you help me understand that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with
the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year
out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But what they’re showing is that as inflation
comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually
going up, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out,
let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if—and actually, you know, since
we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be
meaningfully positive and significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So for us to get inflation down, that probably means—
that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is
Page 21 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming down really significantly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think,
as, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor
do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has not really moved
down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’re
going have to keep at it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Julie.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JULIE CHABANAS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Julie Chabanas, AFP
News Agency.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’
unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you
worried about that—about this rebound?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long-
standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a factor
that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But we do consider that when we’re
thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we do watch that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment,
has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re still
talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half-
century here in the United States.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three-
tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, still, it’s extraordinarily
low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent
question on housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t
Page 22 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we did hear Governor Waller talk
about how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or
a shorter bit of relief than we thought.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and
how that played into today’s outcome?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their
increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s important.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s part of
the overall picture.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What you see is—
look at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re just not seeing a lot of
progress—not the kind of progress we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly,
so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be
3.9 percent this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the
course of the year, and that’s doing that again.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts
are coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
we’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and,
given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might
need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So wages will continue to increase.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we, you know—what
we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s
Page 23 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all,
all of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not
extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back
down but, but quite gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue
gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of
the income spectrum.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to
2 percent, which benefits everyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone
else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>GREG ROBB.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you so much, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just
wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s
strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
mean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be
seeking higher wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does that come up in your discussions?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor
market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, it’s, it’s
very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s half
of our mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we spend a lot of time talking about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you know, we—there,
there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we don’t spend a lot of time—
although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in
discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we—you know, we, we look,
and we see what’s going on.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to
get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as I said, don’t think that was about—I
Page 24 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
didn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is
the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we’re about three months
past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with
commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And could you further elevate those risks
with higher still rates, possibly for longer?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’m trying to think where to start.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll start with commercial real
estate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s a substantial
amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A, a large part of it is in smaller banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take
losses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have
concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re well aware of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re monitoring it carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be
around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you
know, work its way into systemic risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where,
where issues really arose.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the
Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and
in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at
Page 25 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s really
our main focus.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully
monitoring that situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of
things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It might be hard for me to identify
something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re watching
those things very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with
credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able
to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we
can take that into account in our rate setting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I guess that’s what I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can I just follow up on the last part of that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you—do you risk
further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying
as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of
tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because
really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic
purposes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll, we’ll take that into account.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we have responsibility for financial
stability as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you very much.</del></p>
