Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 12, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the
past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains
and a low unemployment rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to
2.7 percent but is still too high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent
goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in
order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more to say
about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half
of 2023.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains
solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last
year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance
of the U.S. economy over the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee
participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median
projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 27

In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong
but a bit below that seen in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low
at 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25
to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has eased over
the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Overall, a broad set of indicators
suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve
of the pandemic—relatively tight but not overheated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>FOMC participants expect labor market
strength to continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the
end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The consumer price
index—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE, PCE price index—
rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly
readings have eased somewhat.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters,
as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE
inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials
Page 2 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As
labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The economic
outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the
federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably
toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The most
recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there
has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We will need to see more good
data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress that we’ve seen on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or
too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering any
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this
year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But these projections are
Page 3 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As the economy evolves, assessments of the
appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we’re prepared to
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the labor
market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated,
we’re prepared to respond.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that
we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the
balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our success in delivering
on these goals matters to all Americans.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We understand that our actions affect communities,
families, and businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Everything we do is in service to our public
mission.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and
price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Just wondering
if you could walk me through the Committee’s average inflation forecast—core PCE is now
forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year-end.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s already 2.75, and after today’s number, there
were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that tell
Page 4 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and, in fact, that it’s going to
get worse?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if you have this wrong, doesn’t it mean that you sort of—you, you could have
wrong the outlook for rates there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in
the second half of last year—June through December, really.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re now lapping those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
as you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes
in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The new reading gets added to the 12-month window.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s just a, a slight element of
conservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly
PCE and core PCE numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And if
you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the
12-month, you know, reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just
the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we were to get more readings like today’s
reading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s just a forecasting device.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think, I
think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But if it comes in—just to follow up—if it comes in the way you
forecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah—no.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we
don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more
confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that
this rules that in or out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month
by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 5 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or, or
remain the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that’s, that’s a really good place to
be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, if I look at
the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut—two cuts
this year—fairly evenly split between the two.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I wonder if you could explain a little
more the nuances or the differences there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Would two or three more inflation readings like the
one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk
to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their
Summary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and
everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a
range of plausible outcomes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”—
you know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re so close for me.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These are
very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as, I think,
you’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or
two.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I
think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No one—no one brings
to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular
rate path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their
own reaction function.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I
Page 6 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t hold it with high confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think if you’re looking for—and, and don’t really
think that they’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “this is what I think is the right
thing.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try
to—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think in terms of what
we need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I’m not going to be specific about
how many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s
going to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with
the balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
look at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Have we reached an appropriate level of
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see
really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which
is—which is another thing that could, could happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, again, we don’t see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I—we
do see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that
would warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And if I could quickly follow up—did, did you or any of your
colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation
numbers today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just is, you
know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when
that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—
Page 7 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what we do is, we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We tell
them how to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and some people do; some people don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Most, most people don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, you
know—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can,
you know, reflect it in one day.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll
know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the initial CPI reading
and its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jonnelle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JONNELLE MARTE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you
noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So do you think that there
still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent,
or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that
many of those imbalances have eased?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind
of overheated two years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance
between supply and demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, what have we seen?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen labor force supply come up
quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s ongoing, mostly
now through the immigration channel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor
force.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving
down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve seen job openings moving down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen wage increases moving from very,
Page 8 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
very high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We have seen
unemployment creep up now sixth-tenths over the course of, of a year or so very, very gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent
unemployment—historically low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and,
you know, that’s an important statistic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument
that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what we
see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor
market very carefully—and that’s what we see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We see gradual cooling—gradual moving
toward better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that,
but we really don’t see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As a quick follow-up—the surveys that make up the jobs report
are, are showing different tales.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s been some divergence, especially, we saw, in the last
report that we got on Friday.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So how do you interpret that, and, and how does it change your
view on the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You just
have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s why it always makes
sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one
report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the
household survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I mean, we’re left
with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, the
overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of
Page 9 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployed people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The jobs–workers gap is still a significantly positive number—greater than
it was before the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, overall, we’re looking at what is still a very strong labor market
but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin, with Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Back on the rates path:
The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March—that’s a period in
which the economic data flow hasn’t been that dramatic a shift.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How, how—can you provide
some color on what changed in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to, to
see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the
inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, as I mentioned
earlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We had really, really good
inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the
confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might
take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we—there
are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so you
really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would
have been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, you get another—you
get data—different data today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’ll have to see where the data light the way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
we’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,
and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ll just
Page 10 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have to see what, what—what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the
outlook and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the Summary of Economic Projections, the long-run interest rate forecast moved
up a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as
restrictive as we’ve previously expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, how should we interpret what that means
about how the Committee views its current policy setting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move
up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a
long-run concept.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And what it is
is the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and
price stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s—
it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today we’ve got a very specific economy
with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s—I, I don’t think that
the, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But,
honestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is
in the near term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because
I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their,
their pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now,
we, we can’t really know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,
but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving
Page 11 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
forces.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, there’s a really good question about whether, whether those really have
changed or whether, instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a, a series of persistent but,
ultimately, temporary shocks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s been the debate, and we can’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in the meantime,
we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I
also—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of
“How restrictive is policy?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The question of whether it’s
sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think for the reasons I’ve
talked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear
that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider, with Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Just
to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of
tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to
market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you
weren’t quite there yet?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think this is about,
you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on
inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Is the labor market still strong?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
what we’re thinking about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language
you’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability,
and another goal, which is maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How are we doing there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think we’ve
got a good, strong labor market still.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think we’ve been making progress toward the price-
Page 12 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then for a while, there was a pause.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we look at today’s thing, and we
think, “Well, that’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, in the
meantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think we think, “Yes, it’s
about right.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting
the things that we would want to get, broadly speaking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s why we’ve been at this
policy rate now for almost a year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so just to follow up on that—I think one, one curious
thing here is, you’ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the
major things for all of this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got growth that stays above long-run potential
throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long-run estimate—
right?—of 4.2.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So this isn’t a story of slack improving inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So where’s the improvement in
inflation coming from that it’s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from—
let’s start with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just
the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and
demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by
restrictive monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those two things have been working together.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve also had a
very positive supply shock on the labor side.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply
shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’ve had, you
know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of
inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest
of this year brinks—brings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I mean,
ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and we don’t know that,
Page 13 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, look at today’s report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, if we see more like that—you know, we
don’t—we can’t know what the future holds.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in the meantime, we’ve made pretty good
progress on inflation with our current stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The base
case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but
your growth forecast doesn’t see any slowdown in the rest of the year, nor does the
unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And your inflation
forecasts basically average out to no change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if, at the end of the year, there is no change
from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What, what would be the point
for a rate cut?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think,
ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real
weakening in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise
rates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not to eliminate the
possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the
Committee does.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what
we’ve been getting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at
a—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, ultimately, we think rates will have
to come down to continue to support that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, so far, they haven’t had to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know,
that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t really see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We kind
of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the
Page 14 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
labor market while we’re continuing to make progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re getting—we’re
getting good results here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, to follow up: Is there any kind of concern for the housing
industry or financial stability—banks—in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean,
ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we
can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There will still be a
national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There will still be one, but the
distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in
terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had the turmoil earlier
last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up
their capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the banking system, you
know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I was
wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see
inflationary pressure in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance,
and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’re seeing, you know, anecdotal
stories of, the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald’s
announcing a $5 meal deal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but
Page 15 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy—and wonder if you
could tell us more about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have
come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know—and I
think you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on
goods, which is kind of hard to understand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some
signal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re seeing—you’re
continuing to see high readings there to some extent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation
from earlier pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, I mean, overall, you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflationary pressures have come
down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wages are still running,
you know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and
trend productivity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we haven’t
thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But at the same time,
getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which
is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>There’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected
this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do
to the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end
of the year or even two?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think if, you know—if you look back in 5 or 10 years and, and try
to pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of one 25 basis point rate cut, you’d, you’d have
quite a job on your hands.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s not how we look at it—you know, really, the whole rate
path matters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen
policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the
market will price in what it prices in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t—I have no way of saying—we’re, we’re not at that
stage, so I don’t know what we’ll be thinking about at that time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s a consequential
decision for the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we, we have the ability to, you know, approach this
question carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we will approach it carefully while we’re very much keeping an eye on,
you know, downside economic risks, should they—should they emerge.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’ve been talking about this clear sense that it’s just going to
take longer to have the confidence that’s needed for rate cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there something about what
happened in the first couple of months of the year that you’re seeing differently now with more
time or hindsight?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting
that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the
parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So—but we had a
quarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we
shouldn’t have taken signal from.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it is what it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, you, you have to—you know,
low inflation is low inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to
take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the
signal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that
Page 17 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s what we said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that was
the right thing to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I still think that’s the right thing to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Now we have today’s inflation
reading, which is very different—very much more positive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to have to see what the
trend is—what’s, what’s going to be the data going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re looking for something that
gives us confidence that inflation is, is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And readings like
today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it
just—it’s only one reading.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any
single data point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jo Ling.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JO LING KENT.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m Jo Ling
Kent, with CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging
economic data but don’t feel good about this economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, you know—I, I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer
why people are, are not as happy about the economy as they might be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t tell people
how they should think or feel about the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not our job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We—you know, people
experience what they experience.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is,
we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve got a very strong labor market with
unemployment at 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of
time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had a period of high
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can
to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re confident that we’ll get there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful
for, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high
Page 18 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is people who—lower-income people—people who are at the margins of the
economy who, who have the worst experience—who experience the most pain from inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that
we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As just a quick follow-up here—you’ve indicated one interest rate cut
sometime this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I know you don’t have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are
watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>For everybody who’s
out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But what we
said is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back
down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So having that kind
of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,
to all Americans, for a long period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We had that period for a very long time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We very
much want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a
concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We were there for a long time, and
our goal is to get back to that place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in
the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m just drawing on the change in the
statement on there being “modest further progress” on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, halfway, you know,
through the year and after today’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee
members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just in terms of the
Page 19 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth,
clearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see
still-strong growth—solid growth this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s been very encouraging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If you go back a
year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a
recession—many forecasters had that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s not what happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Instead, we—the U.S. is,
anyway, and it’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the
world.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s been encouraging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say that the, the—today’s inflation report is
encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You asked about—your second question was really about shelter inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think if
you go back a couple of years—we, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you
know, people who own their houses.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we have OER, which is owners’ equivalent rent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the—of the—when the
economy reopened, they really went up sharply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those play into rollover rents much more
slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and so what we—so we, we’ve
found now that there are big lags.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in,
in market rents.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has to get worked off, and that may take, you know, several years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain—are going at—up at relatively low levels—and
they still are—you know, this, this is just going to happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It just is going to happen more slowly
than we thought.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to, to owned
homes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—you know, many countries around the world do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some do it differently

than us.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s something that the—you know, that the, the price experts have regularly looked at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is not something that we’re the only country that does, and it’s not something we’re looking at
changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it—it’s true.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s one of the
very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services
that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they’re actually living in it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And some countries—you should just ignore that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But that’s not our—that’s not how we do
inflation here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we do it the way we do it, and we’ve been very transparent about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
you know, it’s true that we’re—we’re seeing delays in, in realizing what—what’s happening
economically.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we understand that—you know, we understand that very well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking
the question, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The last jobs report
showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s up 8.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And since January of 2021, we’ve seen prices rise 19 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So people are using their credit
cards to pay for their lifestyle.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy
could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income
during big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is
people spending more on their credit cards.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That—that has been happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Credit card
balances have been going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Credit card defaults have been going up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re not at high
levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They couldn’t spend money.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But households
Page 21 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
were in very, very strong—historically strong—financial shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’ve now worked off a lot
of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, we’re watching that carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, what do we see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what
we see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household
sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of
shape it was in a year or two ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So how close then are we to that point where the consumer
can’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can’t hire like they’re hiring?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So consumer spending is still growing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s not growing at the pace it
was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, by the way,
other parts of the economy are picking up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has
picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—
you know, tech plants.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know—
something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for
the U.S. economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, no, you’re, you’re right, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we do see the same thing other
people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower-income
people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is, is to foster a very strong jobs economy,
which we think we have done—ultimately to get inflation under control, because those people
experience inflation, you know, very directly—very painfully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, once, once
we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which, which will also improve things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’ve mentioned that
unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was just
wondering—can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it more of, like, a
Page 22 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quicker pace of people losing jobs?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to
start to go above 4.2 or something like that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How are you thinking about what you’re looking
for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is
more than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’ll be looking at everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the
ability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So waiting for that to happen is,
is not what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance
of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all
of it—the whole situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy
could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I, you know, I would just—
you know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And if we saw troubling—weakening
more than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
we’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So something like negative payroll numbers would be—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not going to—yeah, I mean, I, I can think of things that would—
many things would make it on that list, but I don’t think I’ll, I’ll utter them here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>May I ask—you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE [inflation] readings earlier
this year, that it wasn’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more
cautious in the rate outlook.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be
quite good for PCE [inflation], as it was for CPI—does that imply that kind of two more good
Page 23 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
months would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently
project?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I, I don’t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in,
in my thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I get that, you know—as many good ones as we had bad ones—but it’s not
like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s the whole.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s going to be the totality of the data—[including] labor market data,
the growth data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that
builds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I don’t want
to try to give you specific numbers of things, because that points to dates, and I, I just don’t
think—we’re not at a point of being able to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Kosuke.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>KOSUKE TAKAMI.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for doing this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I am Kosuke Takami, with Nikkei.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in—Japan and some
emerging markets are suffering from the strong dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I want to know if it is having a
positive impact on U.S. economy in total?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the
Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing
things about the level of the dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So for us, it’s just another financial variable.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’re
right—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last
year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t think of it as benefiting or hurting
the U.S. We don’t—again, we don’t manage the level of the dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s not our—
that’s not our job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know—and for, for our economy, what, you know, we’re trying
Page 24 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to foster is maximum employment and price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we feel like we’ve made good
progress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer Schonberger, with
Yahoo Finance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re
forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re at 2.8 percent, of course,
on core PCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to
2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You also indicated the
job market has mostly normalized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So why not cut rates this summer just once—you’re well
above neutral—to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest
for confidence for inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks
here, let me just say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of
economic activity, of employment, of the expansion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We understand that if we move too, too
quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over,
and it could be very disruptive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and
just basically trying to manage them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t
think it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is
moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s—that’s kind of been our test.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s our—that’s our
dual mandate there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we, we have a strong economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve got growth—all
forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our
Page 25 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Unemployment is still
low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully, and that’s, that’s what
we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just to follow, Chair Powell—do you need to be
ahead of a weakening in the labor market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Otherwise, is it too late, given that the labor market is
a lagging indicator—right?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s,
that’s not what we’re—that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework,
and we think we’re doing that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>EVAN RYSER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Evan Ryser with Market News International.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Who will lead it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Will
you be—will it be you or a member—a Committee group of your—of your peers?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What will be
the parameters?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going
forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we—what, what we’ve been thinking is that we would announce
and commence the review later or late in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the meantime, as that time approaches, we
will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Within scope would
certainly be communications generally.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that
particular thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get
Page 26 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prematurely into a conversation until it’s really time to have it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, you know, I’m going to
leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Go to Nancy, for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer, with
Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just one more question on housing—can you still cut rates with shelter prices high,
or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable, like housing
prices moderating, that would really decide or decide against what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve got an
overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a
sustainable basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s our overall test.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the
labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those are—those are two different tests.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say, you know, we’re not—
we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “That’s the one.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t
target housing prices, for example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t target wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We, we target aggregate prices
and overall employment, so—
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow
down the pace of rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think you’d look at the over—we’d be looking at the aggregate
numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What’s going on here with inflation in the—at the
aggregate level?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, you know—and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing
inflation would, would matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter,
too, but I wouldn’t single out housing as having a, a special role there.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 1, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Inflation has
eased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s
very good news.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not
assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are fully committed to returning inflation to our
2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market
that benefits all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our restrictive stance of monetary
policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our
2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters, even as high interest rates
Page 1 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have weighed on housing and equipment investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Improving supply conditions have
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come
into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while
the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Strong job creation over the past year has
been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation
among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal
wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor
demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The inflation data
received so far this year have been higher than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Although some measures of short-term
inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear
to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
Page 2 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
holdings, though at a slower pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and
inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved
toward better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly
attentive to inflation risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range
for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is
likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are
prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we’ve seen on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too
little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering any adjustments
to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,
the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks
and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to
make decisions meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Turning to our balance sheet: The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the
pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per
month to $25 billion per month as of June 1.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold
primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities
Page 3 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unchanged per month, and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury
securities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion
per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The decision to
slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it
would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to
set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We, at the
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>A question and
follow-up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still—are you confident that it’s
sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I do think the evidence shows, you know, pretty clearly that
policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can start with the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So demand is still strong—the demand side of the
labor market, in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,
Page 4 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and you see that in job openings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You saw it—more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report,
as you’ll know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s still higher than pre-pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it has been coming down both in the
Indeed report and the JOLTS report.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s, that’s demand cooling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The same is true of quits
and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I also look at the—we look at surveys of
workers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses, and [they] ask workers, “Are jobs
plentiful?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>and ask businesses, “Are workers plentiful?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it easy to find workers?”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’ve
seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You also see in
interest-sensitive spending, like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates
are weighing on those activities.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sufficiently restrictive, I guess.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that]
over time it will be sufficiently restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That will be a question that, that the data will have to
answer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So as a follow-up, if inflation continues running roughly
sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and
expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for—
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Expectations are not anchored?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Stable, roughly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would you disrupt that for the last half point
on PCE?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I don’t want to get into complicated hypotheticals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I
would say that, you know, we’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy
for as long as is appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wonder—you
know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to
increase further, although it’s not her baseline outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder if you see that as a risk as well,
and, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d say it’s unlikely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is—
which is how long to keep policy restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You ask, what would it take?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, I think
we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re
seeing, as I—as I mentioned, but that’s—something like that is what it would take.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’d look at
the totality of the data in answer to that question.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That would include inflation, inflation
expectations, and all the other data too.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Would that be—would that be a reacceleration in inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come
to that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of
all the things we’d be looking at.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It could be expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It could be a combination of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that
conclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
didn’t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn’t mention the idea that it
might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
has the Fed sort of dropped its easing bias?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Where are you standing on that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, on—let me address cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, obviously, our decisions that we
make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving,
and the balance of risks, as always.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll look at the totality of the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think, and we
think, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And
we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance
until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves
more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving
sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could
be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there’s also other paths that the economy could take, which, which would cause us
to want to consider rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain
greater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and
another path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it really will depend on the
data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think the data
will have to answer that question for us.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 7 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And could you just follow—on the path where you might
not cut, is that—you mentioned that would be inflation persistent—I mean, is inflation—would
that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin
to reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know,
moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the
performance of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’d also be looking at inflation expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’d be looking at the
whole story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that
decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, to what
extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in
growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed
to resume the sort of disinflation the economy saw last year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s hard to know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ll be able to look back,
you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, if you look
at—let’s look at growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Really, what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth
coming in about consistent with where it was last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I know GDP came in lower, but you
don’t see an acceleration in growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the thought would be that financial conditions
loosened in, in, December, and that caused an uptick in activity, and that caused inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Presumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You don’t really see that
happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as, as last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 8 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So, you know, what’s causing this inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ll, we’ll have a better sense of that
over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know that there’s an obvious connection there, though, with easing of
financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rates are certainly higher now
and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they’re higher,
and that’s tighter financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation
has done in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’t necessarily
preclude rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I wonder, would continued strength in the labor market change your view
about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was
reaccelerating?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the
labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And remember what we saw last year: very strong growth, a really tight labor
market, and a historically fast decline in inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—and that’s because we know there are
two forces at work here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions
and demand-side distortions, and there’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary
policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I wouldn’t give
up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because, you know, we do
see that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also,
even when the supply-side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic
activity and ultimately inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there are still those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t like to say that either
strong—either growth or, or a strong labor market, in and of itself, would automatically create
problems on inflation, because, of course, it didn’t do that last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 9 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You ask about wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also don’t—we don’t target wages.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We target price inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is one of the inputs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The point with wages is, of course, we, like everyone else, like to see high
wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s really what we’re
trying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to
bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Part of that will probably be having
wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is
sustainably moving back down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s May now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you have time this year to cut
three times, just given the calendar?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not really thinking of it that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, the—what
we said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said
that we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’ve said that it appears, then,
that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t know how long
it’ll take.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in
scope.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I don’t know exactly when that will be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on
now, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more
worrying than just expected bumpiness?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I—you know, not really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, what, what—so I thought it was
appropriate to reserve judgment until, until we had the full quarter’s data, until we saw the March
data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so take a step back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What do we now see in the first quarter?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see strong economic
Page 10 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We see three inflation readings, and
so I think you’re at a point there where you should take some signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t like to react to
one or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now,
and we are taking signal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us
to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the
signal that we’re taking now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chair, if I could—Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up
on that: What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first
quarter?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and
quarters?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we will—you know, we will put the thing—we have put
the thing under a microscope.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will say, nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to
change the view.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that, in fact, we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer
to get that confidence—but—confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just think—you know the story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s happened
since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher
nonhousing services inflation than expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And those two are working together to, to sort of be
higher than we had thought.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know,
we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation
move back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s my forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think my confidence in that is lower than it was
because of the data that we’ve seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we’re looking at those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also
continue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market
rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We believe that it
Page 11 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just—it looks like the lag—that there are substantial lags between when, you know,
lower market rates turned up and—for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or
for in-housing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could just follow up: Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea
that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you’re holding
rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t say that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the active tool of monetary policy
is, of course, the interest rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to
slow, really not in order to, you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be
less restrictive to the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance
sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial
market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve
ever done this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CRAIG TORRES.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Two questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First, a simple one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased
or stayed the same?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the first question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Second question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, you joined the
Board in 2012, and I’m sure you remember, as I do, what the jobless recovery was like: lawyers,
accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’t get jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And given your history
there, I wonder if there’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We have strong
productivity growth that’s helping wages grow up—go up.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We have good employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
it seems to me there’s a lot of hysteria about inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I agree—you know, nobody likes it, but is
Page 12 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
there an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over
time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut
until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
didn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in fact, what really
happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think
there are—you know, I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to
predict—to predict its path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s really going to depend on the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our,
our sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of
them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It actually—it’s the
time to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that was
clearly inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So our focus was very much on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As—and this is what we referred to
in the statement.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month
basis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The employment goal now comes
back into focus.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we are focusing on it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and that’s how we think about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask
the questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that
you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that’s going to allow you to have a situation where
rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’d be good if you could just
Page 13 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
confirm whether or not that’s a correct reading.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the Q1 GDP print has led to some—some to
start mentioning the term “stagflation” with respect to the U.S. economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you or anyone else
on the FOMC think this is now a risk?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not dealing really in likelihoods.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there are—there
are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal
forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know that it
will be enough, sufficient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know that it won’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’re going to have to let the data
lead us on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess I would say I
was around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was
high single-digits inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have
3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we
have inflation running under 3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s
coming from.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that
last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know—
and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that would be—that would
be our forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That wouldn’t be stagflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That would still be to a very healthy level of
growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, with inflation, you know, our—we will return inflation to 2 percent, and
that won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually. [</del></p>

<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, he’s “Mr. Potential Growth/r*.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you share that view, and would
that imply that maybe policy isn’t tight enough?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of
very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity
growth in 2022.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think it’s hard to draw from the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, the question is, will
productivity run—there are two questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One is: Will productivity run persistently above its
longer-run trend?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think we know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of potential output, though, that’s a
separate question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve had a—what amounts to a, a significant increase in the potential output
of the economy that’s not about productivity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was about having more labor, frankly, both
through—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re very
much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for
potential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think—in that
case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ve also got—so
you’ve got more supply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So you’ve also got demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you
get demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary
over, over a longer period.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You said earlier that, at this point, you’re not really considering
rate increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If growth is higher, but you’re not considering rate increases, does that imply that
you’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation
taking off again?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is
appropriate to the current situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence
Page 15 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for that, I went over earlier.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see it in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see it in inflation-sensitive
spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s
more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the
supply side.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how I would think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So GDP growth is about 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation—[Un]employment is about 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It
feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if the data remains the same
that you’re seeing, and I know you said you don’t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you
would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So was there any discussion about a
rate hike in today’s meeting, and, you know, are you satisfied with 3 percent inflation for the rest
of the year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation. “</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Three
percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Laughter] So we will return inflation to
2 percent over time but over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably
down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
don’t see that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t see evidence for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s where we are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do
about, about holding the current—the current level of restriction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s really—that’s part of the
policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to follow [up] on the 3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there a time frame
of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There isn’t any rule.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You can’t look to a rule.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, these are—
these are going to be judgment calls.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more
time to do its job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that is pretty clear, based on what we’re seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How long that will take
and how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook
evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve talked about your
commitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I was just wondering, given that it’s an
election year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, similarly, is there a
significant economic difference between, you know, starting to cut in, say, September versus
December?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for
the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it’s the right thing to do for the
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s our record.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not looking at anything else.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
it’s hard enough to get the economics right here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These are difficult things, and if, if we were to
take on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood
we’d actually get the economics right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s how we think about it around here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, we’re at peace over it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we
think it’s the right thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ll all do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, that’s how everybody around here
thinks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I can’t say it enough, that we just don’t—we just don’t go down that road.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you go
down that road, where do you stop?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and so we’re not on that road.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re on the road
Page 17 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where we’re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and
how those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, is there a significant difference between, you know,
whether you start in, say, September versus December?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s—
VICTORIA GUIDA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>An economic difference.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CHAIR POWELL. —</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>a significant difference between an institution that takes into
account all sorts of political events and one that doesn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s where the significant difference
is, and, you know, we’re—we just don’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, you can go back and read the
transcripts for every—this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Read all the
transcripts, and see if anybody mentions, in any way, the pending election.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just isn’t part of
our thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not what we’re hired to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we start down that road, again, I don’t know
how you stop.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Simon.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Question about the labor market—
you’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Certainly, today’s JOLTS
data suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre-pandemic levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>One thing that hasn’t
normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder
if you can share your analysis of, of why that’s happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is it a lagging indicator, or is
something else going on?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I think if you go back to where wages peaked—wage increases
peaked a couple, three years ago—essentially all wage measures have come down substantially
[when compared] to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But they are not, not down to where they were before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 18 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
They’re still roughly a percentage point higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve seen pretty consistent progress but
not uniformly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was—it was expected to be—to
have come down, and, essentially, it was flat year over year, you know, I think roughly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So yeah,
I mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, again, we don’t target wage increases, but, you know,
in the longer run, if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity
would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Employers will raise prices
over time if that’s the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ve seen progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It has been inconsistent, but we have seen a
substantial decline overall.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we have a ways to go on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Scott.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hey, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer from
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You mentioned consumers, and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates
right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mortgage rates are up, as are rates for car loans, credit cards.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People looking to
borrow are very discouraged.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s reflected in their views on the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What would you
say to them?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the
lower-income brackets, is inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck, and
suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price, you, you are in
trouble right away.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’re doing is, we’re
using our tools to bring down inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It will take some time, but we will succeed.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we will
bring inflation back down to 2 percent, and then people won’t have to worry about it again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the dividends will
be paid and will be very large.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and everyone will share in those dividends, and we’ve made
quite a lot of progress if you can think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think core—I think headline—core PCE
Page 19 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
[inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now it’s at—anyway, headline peaked at 7.1.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now it’s at 2.7.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Don’t want to get that wrong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, you don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Quick follow-up—are current interest
rates really doing that much, though, to fight inflation right now for those consumers?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is
doing what it’s supposed to do, and it’s—but it’s also, in this case unusually, working alongside
and with the healing of the supply side.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This, this—what was different this time was that a big
part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we
had this supply-side kind of collapse, with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other
things that, that really raised demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, many factors did that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think now you see those
two things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the
pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those two things are
working to bring down inflation, and we’ve made a lot of progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s remember how far
we’ve come.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we have a ways to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve got work left to do, but we’re not looking at the
very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing
inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s kind of been this long-awaited disinflation in shelter that still hasn’t arrived.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private-
sector data we’re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be
helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, essentially, there are—there are a number of places in the
economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process, and housing is one of
them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when you have—when, when someone goes to—a new person goes to rent an
apartment, that’s called market rent, and you can see market rents are barely going up at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The
inflation in those has been very low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it takes—before that, they were incredibly high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They
sort of led the, the high part.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what happens is, those market rents take years, actually, to get
all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Landlords don’t tend to
charge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant, for whatever reason.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what that does is it
builds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
what happens is, you know—it’s complicated, but the story is it just takes some time for that to
get in.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in
measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How—what will be the exact
timing of it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’ve learned that the lags are longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We now think significantly longer
than we thought at the beginning, and so confident that it will come but not so confident in the
timing of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But, yes, I expect that, that this will happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nick Jasinski.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is
Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s Magazine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It seems that over the past three or four years,
economies and central banks in developed markets, at least, have been on more or less the same
trajectory: easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the
U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So my question is, what, what
Page 21 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
considerations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central
bank policies present for the FOMC?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that—you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that, that may happen, and, you know
that we all serve domestic mandates, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think the difference between the United States
and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of
growth we’re having.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little
better, but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we actually have
the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job
creation, and all of that, and we can be patient.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as
we approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
priced in now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think, you know,
we haven’t seen—in addition, for the emerging market economies, we haven’t seen the kind of
turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s, I think, partly because
emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much
more credibility on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to
encounter pain for inflation to come back down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, given the sticky inflation data in the first
quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy, or is some
softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we thought, and most people thought, there
would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor
market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of
this episode.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That didn’t happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a tremendous result.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re very, of course, gratified
and pleased that that hasn’t happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it
really was that this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren’t
to do with monetary policy but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know,
supply problems—supply-side problems and also some, some demand issues as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now, as I’ve said, I’m not giving up on
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think—I think it is possible that, that those forces will still work to help us bring
inflation down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can’t—we can’t be guaranteed that that’s true, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And so we’re—you
know, we’re trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy
strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We will bring inflation
down to 2 percent sustainably.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We hope we can do it without, you know, without significant
dislocations in the labor market or elsewhere.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And speaking of dislocations in the labor market: In
terms of cutting, you said, if there were weakness in the job market, that could be a reason to cut
rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to
your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Would the unemployment rate popping back
above 4 percent catch your attention?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I
characterized it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to
Page 23 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>A
couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be—would probably not do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But a
broader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be
appropriate to consider cutting.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and
circumstances, not just that one.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KYLE CAMPBELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kyle Campbell with
American Banker.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III
Endgame proposal, and you’ve mentioned that a re-proposal is something that’s on the table.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As
you’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the
options available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re-proposal will be necessary,
and do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on
that front—either a re-proposal or a move to finalize?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me—let me start by saying that the Fed is committed to, you
know, completing this process and carrying out Basel III Endgame in a way that’s faithful to
Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
haven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nothing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No decisions
have been made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll say again, though, if we conclude that re-proposal is appropriate, we won’t
hesitate to insist on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then do you need to resolve issues with the capital proposal in
order to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda, or do you expect to continue to make
progress on those other agenda items?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 24 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, there’s no mechanical rule in place there.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I would say
that the, you know, the Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is, I think,
occupying us at this time in terms of what’s, what’s—what we’re moving ahead with.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MARK HAMRICK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, what
can you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in the sense of trying to achieve
consensus, which you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or
even dissent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more
spirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you avoid groupthink and
avoid a higher risk of a policy mistake?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues
on the FOMC, you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
really don’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have
12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people
who work here at the Board.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are different people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, and so each, each Reserve
Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I try to incorporate
their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I
think many people, if they feel that’s happening, you know, that for most people most of the

time, that’ll be enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but I’m not—I mean, it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or
illegal or against the rules or anything like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just is the way things come out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly, more
diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and
demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D. economists.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have
people from business and law and academia and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we actually do have
quite a good diverse perspective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity,
and we look around the room and say, “I don’t understand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I really don’t understand what
they’re talking about.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but I get the question, though.</del></p>
