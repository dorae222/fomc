Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
January 29, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy is strong—is strong overall and has made significant
progress toward our goals over the past two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Labor market conditions have cooled from
their formerly overheated state and remain solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ll have more
to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>For 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer
spending.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter
but was strong for the year overall.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the
housing sector seems to have stabilized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per
month over the past three months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has
stabilized since the middle of last year and, at 4.1 percent in December, remains low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal
wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Overall, a
wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>The
labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
Page 1 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full
percentage point from its peak.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light
of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With our policy stance
significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need
to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes
our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy remains—economy
remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can
Page 2 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
maintain policy restraint for longer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or
inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy is
well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our
dual mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As we previously announced, our five-year review, review of our monetary policy
framework is taking place this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by
reviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the
experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our review will again include
outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events
around the country and a research conference in May.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Throughout this process, we will be open
to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in
determining our findings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would note that
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be a focus
of the review.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-run inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to your questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 27

STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, all
right, at an event in Davos—or from, to Davos, anyway—the President said he’ll demand that
interest rates drop immediately.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I guess I have a three-part question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Has the President done
this to you?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Has he made that demand?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Secondly, what is your response to that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, third,
what effect, if anything—if any, does a President making these kind of remarks have on policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Three questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m seeing, seeing it really as one question, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I, I’m not going to have—I’m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever
on, on what the President’s said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not appropriate for me to do so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The public should be
confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have—focusing on using our tools
to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s how we
best serve the public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you just comment on whether he’s physically communicated
his demand to you?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’ve had no contact.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, you and
several of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was
“meaningfully restrictive.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given economic and financial market developments since then, how
has your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully
restrictive?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 4 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think that my assessment really has changed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, a
couple of things have happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve gotten more strong data, but we’ve also seen rates move
up at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think if we look
back over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If you look at the effect of
high rates on interest-sensitive spending—for example, in housing—and if you look at the
achievement of our goal variables, we’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation
and, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Though we literally look at the—at
the—at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now, policy is
meaningfully less restrictive than it was before we began to cut.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s 100 basis points less
restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on
inflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we—before we consider
making adjustments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could follow up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Does the economy here warrant meaningfully
restrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if
you were to lower them by another ¼ point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, I, I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I
mentioned, to balance the achievement of our two—of our two goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We, we want to—policy
to be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation
goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>At the same time, we don’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve
that goal, and that’s kind of what we’ve been getting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The labor market has really been broadly
stable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Conditions seem to
be broadly in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see
we don’t—we don’t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, nonetheless, the
Page 5 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last couple of readings have suggested, you know, more positive readings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think we’re—I
think policy’s well, well positioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby, from the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Colby Smith, with the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, how should we
interpret the removal of the line from the statement that inflation has made progress towards the
2 percent goal?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that no longer the case?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, so let me look—if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a
little bit of language cleanup there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We took out a reference to “since earlier in the year” as it
related to the labor market, and we just chose to, to shorten that sentence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, I, I mean, if
you look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was—there was another
inflation reading, I guess, just before the December meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, we’ve got two, two good
readings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Again, we’re not going to
overinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than
this: You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving
our 2 percent inflation goal sustainably.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And just to follow up: We’ve seen inflation expectations across a
number of measures rise sharply—which has, in part, been linked to tariff concerns.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But there’s
also been this encouraging data that you mentioned in terms of CPI and rent indices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So how
would you characterize concerns about upside risks to inflation across the Committee, especially
those tied to policies related to the Trump Administration?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well I, I’d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the
short end—but not at the longer run, which [is] where it really matters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And those could be
related to—could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think where the
Page 6 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, and we,
we don’t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with
regulatory policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re only just beginning to see—actually, are not really beginning to see
much, and I think we need to—we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even
begin to make a, a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
we’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is no different than any
other set of policy changes at the beginning of a—of an Administration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll patiently watch
and understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of
understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You and
your colleagues normally condition future policy moves with the phrase, “if the economy
develops as we anticipate.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is it fair to say that since there’s a lot unknown about what this
Administration’s fiscal policies are actually going to be that you don’t have a medium- to long-
term economic forecast that you can have confidence in?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or, if that’s not true, can you lay out
what you think is going to happen in the economy, how you see it developing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, at all times—at all times, forecasts are conditional, at a
minimum, on just a set of expectations, and, and they’re highly uncertain in both directions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We,
we know that economic forecasting is, is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So in
the current situation, there’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of, of, you know,
significant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned: tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal
policy, and, and regulatory policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that
should be passing; we should go through that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then we’ll be back to the regular amount of
Page 7 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, what, what forecasters are doing—not just us, but everybody’s doing—is
they’ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they’re really kind of
in the nature of a placeholder, and—meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you
wouldn’t stand behind it because you just don’t know, and so you’re just—you’re just on hold,
waiting to see what comes down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s, it’s a very large economy, and policies affect
it at the margin, but we’ll, you know, we’re going to wait and see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The idea that you feel the—that policy is
restrictive suggests that the Fed, in general, wants to continue to lower interest rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So when
you look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can
cut or data that will tell you [that] you should hold?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re—we’re looking—it’s more the other—the way—
the way it works is, we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know,
that, that’s what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Policy’s well
positioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy’s in, in quite a good place, actually, as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And what, what we do
expect is to see further progress on inflation, and, you know, as I mentioned, as we see that—or
if we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster—we could then be in a position
of, of making further adjustments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, right now, we, we don’t see that, and we see things as in
a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a
hurry to, to make any adjustments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you very much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
2021, at a central bank conference, you said, quote, “Throughout my career in both public and
private sectors, I’ve seen that the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that
Page 8 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>These organizations
consistently attract the best talent by investing in and retaining a world-class workforce.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Question, first question is, do you still believe that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if so, how do you intend to put that
belief into practice while remaining consistent with the recent executive order prohibiting
diversity and inclusion efforts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say, “yes,” in answer to your first question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, to the
second question, I want to say this: We are, like others, we’re reviewing the orders and the
associated details as they are made available.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as has been our practice over many
Administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate
and consistent with applicable law.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I want to add that I’m not going to have anything more
specific for you today on this whole set of issues.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, if I could just follow up quickly on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering
how you’re getting that to be consistent with the Dodd-Frank law’s stipulations about
maintaining an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I did—I did mention “consistent with applicable law,” right?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Which is governing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks so much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just to
follow up on Steve’s question, what reassurance can you give the American public that the Fed
will continue to operate independent of politics under this Administration?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, I’ve—as I’ve said countless times over the years, this
is—this is who we are; this is what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We study the data, we, we analyze how it will affect
the outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,
Page 9 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
our best thinking, try to achieve our goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we do; that’s always what we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Don’t
look for us to do anything else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—you know, lots of research shows that’s the—that’s
the best way for a central bank to operate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’ll give us the best possible chance to achieve
these goals for the benefit of the American people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s always what we’re going to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
people should have confidence in that, as I—as I said a few minutes ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve said that the Fed is in wait-and-see mode, based on
the policies that come out of this Administration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Has the Fed started to model what policies like
mass deportations, changes in immigration policy, specifically, would look like for the
workforce and for inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So one of the things our, our staff does is they, they look at a range
of possible outcomes, and, and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you
know, it’s, it’s one of the best things that they do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And in each Tealbook—you can look at the
five-year-old Tealbooks and see their alternative simulations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what they do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They, it’ll
be a baseline, and then they’ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones
and, and not-so-good ones.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to
sort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So,
yes, we, we—staff does that, and we, we’re all well aware that there are—that the range of
possibilities is always broad, and—not just now, but always.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you have to—it’s hard to be
open to just how, how broad the possibilities are for an economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, no one saw the
pandemic coming, and it was—you know, it changed everything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So things happen, and—but
yes, we do—we do do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what
might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’t act until
you—until you see much more than we see now.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CATARINA SARAIVA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, last month
you talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more
progress in inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would
you say that that’s even more so the case now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’d say it’s the same.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, we, we want to see, you know,
further progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, the story’s there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s—we’re just going to
have to see the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the end of the day, it, it comes down to 12-month inflation, because that
takes out the seasonality issues that may exist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, we’re, we’re just going to need
to see that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think that—we think we see the pathway for that to happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One, one
example—a key example—is that you now do see owner’s equivalent rent and, you know,
housing services—the way it’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty
steadily now, and that’s the—that’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
addition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services
[prices], which don’t tend to send much signal [about future inflation].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you can look through
all that and, and think, “Okay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But being
seem to set up for it is one thing; having it is another.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we, we’re going to want to see further,
further progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Remember, we’re not, you know, we’re, we’re under—2 percent,
but our goal is 2 percent, and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and in terms of the labor market, I mean, how—is that
broadly—you know, you said a broad set of indicators show that it’s in pretty solid place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was
there broad agreement on that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s been a few underlying indicators that are showing
Page 11 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
perhaps some weakness: a low hiring rate, you know, workers reporting that it’s increasingly
difficult to find a job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that of concern to the Committee?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, we look at, of course, a very broad range.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, so, it starts with unemployment—sorry, with, yeah, with the unemployment rate,
employment participation, wages, job quits—are people quitting?—that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The ratio
of vacancies to unemployed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger, though,
on—it’s a low—it’s a low-hiring environment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you have a job, it’s all—it’s all good, but if
you—if you have to find a job, the job-finding rate—the hiring rates have come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And
that’s, that’s more typical of a—let’s say—let’s say that the unemployment—that the—that the
labor market is at a sustainable level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not overheated anymore.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t think we need it to
cool off anymore.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do watch it extremely carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s one of our two goal variables.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But,
yeah, I, I’d say we watch those things quite carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But nonetheless, overall, look at the
aggregate data in the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It does seem to—the labor market does seem, seem to be
pretty stable and broadly in balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>When you’ve got a, an unemployment rate that is—that has
been pretty stable now for, for a, a full half a year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>On employment, now, you said there’s a broad range of possibilities, but last
September you said, quote, “We understand that there’s been quite an influx across the borders,
and that has actually been one of things that’s allowed unemployment rate to rise.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Now that the
flow over the border has slowed and we’re seeing deportations, how do you expect the
unemployment rate to react?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 12 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, so what’s happening is that the, the flows across the
border have decreased very significantly, and there’s every reason to expect that to continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so—but job creation has come down a bit, too, so, you know, if those two things come
down together, that, that sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In other
words, a breakeven rate—as, as population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in
new jobs to make—to, to make jobs for, for workers declines as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that seems to be
something about what’s happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You, you do see a very—a very flat unemployment rate at a
time when you’ve seen significant declines [in job growth].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I want to ask you about Fed employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I know that tax
money is not used here, but Elon Musk alleges that the Fed is, quote, “absurdly overstaffed.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve seen the Executive Branch push to reduce the federal workforce.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just want to get your
reaction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we, we run a very careful budget process where we’re
fully aware that what, that, you know, we owe the—we owe that to the public, and we believe we
do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I’ve got no further comment than that, thanks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>President Trump has said he
will lower inflation by reducing gas and energy costs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you see such costs as a particular
driver of inflation, and would lowering them have a dramatic effect?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris, I’m not going to—I’m not going to react or discuss anything
that, that any elected politician might say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll give you a mulligan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Okay, oh, thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, nearly two weeks ago the Fed said it
was withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System even as, you know, even
Page 13 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
as we have significant wildfires in Los Angeles doing billions of dollars in damage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of
course, the NGFS, as you know, is a group to talk about how the financial system could address
climate change.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many commentators did see the timing as political.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Why did you leave that
organization?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you explain that decision?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sure, I’d be glad to.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we considered this, you know, really at
length, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, really, the reason is that the, the
work that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Think about nature-related risks and
biodiversity and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, the, the work of the NGFS is, is, in, in significant
part intended to—and this is a quote—“mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition
toward a sustainable economy.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we joined to get the benefit of understanding what other
central banks were doing and, and seeing research and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think this is just way
beyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow
role, as I’ve—as I’ve said many times, and I think that, that the activities of the NGFS are not a
good fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, and I just think it
was time to acknowledge that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the, the process—this process dates back—thinking
about it dates back a couple of years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I made the decision to bring this to the Board, you know,
some months ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It just—it just—the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when—
this is when we, we got in and voted on it, so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m aware of how it can look, but it was
really not driven by politics; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the
NGFS and our mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have no, no criticism of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it just isn’t—it’s not right for the Fed.</strong></em></p>

ANDREW ACKERMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m
wondering if you could talk more about what further progress would look like for consumers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, 2 percent—inflation down to—inflation down to 2 percent
sustainably is what, what we’re trying to achieve.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, we’re, we’re somewhat above that,
as you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that
we’re making further progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And consumers will,
will pick that up, of course, in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you
think you are from neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, you can’t know with any precision, of course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I like to say,
that you know that—you know the neutral rate by its works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent
we’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee’s estimates of the longer-run
neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s really the question we ask.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you can consult models, empirical models,
theoretical models.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You really have to just look out the window and see how your—how your
policy rate is affecting the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I think we see that it’s having meaningful effects in
bringing inflation under control.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s what we think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I would say we’re meaningfully above it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I am—I, I have no illusion
that, that anyone knows precisely how much that is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, but it, you know—not knowing that,

make further adjustments.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as a general matter, when it
comes to executive orders and OMB memos, do those always apply to the Fed, sometimes,
never, or do you just often voluntarily comply?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What is—what is the legality there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s been—it’s been our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align
our policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s—I’m just going
to leave it at that.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Claire Jones from the Financial Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Two questions, if I may, on
tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, first of all, we’ve seen global trade wars before, notably in 2019 last time around.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But then we were then in a very different place on both inflation and growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we see tariffs of
the same sort of magnitude that we got then—which I know is a big if—what do you think might
be different this time around?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, secondly, Tiff Macklem said there was no doubt that the
threat of tariffs was a big driver of the cut by the Bank of Canada today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What sort of
information would the Fed need to see on tariffs before it was willing to take such a preemptive
move?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry, make a—?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To—what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would you need to see a strategy, actual implementation, actual movement of inflation
expectations, before you’re actually willing to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of
it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we just—so first of all, thing, things are a little different now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve just come through a high-inflation period, and you can argue that both ways.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You can—
Page 16 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but, but we also
hear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and
so I don’t know how that shakes out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, you’re coming through a situation where
we’re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that’s just different.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, you know, the trade—the kind of footprint of trade is, has changed a, a lot, as
trade is now spread around the, you know—it’s not as concentrated in China as it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There
was a lot more manufacturing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It moved to Mexico and other places.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so there were
differences, and I just think the, the range of possibilities is, is very, very wide.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We just don’t
know, and I, I don’t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we didn’t know, by the way, in, I guess, 2018.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, we didn’t really know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it, you
know, the—again, the range of possibilities, very, very wide.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know what’s going to be
tariff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know for how long or how much, what countries.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know about
retaliation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>That’s, that really does remain to be seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, there are lots of places where that—where
that—where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a
consumer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just so many variables.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re just going to have to wait and see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know,
the best we can do is what we’ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at
historical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then
we’ll just have to see—have to see how it—how it goes.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then the second question is just—I wonder if the AI-prompted

selloff in the stock market this week signaled anything to you about the state of financial
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, on QT, on—let’s, let’s talk about runoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the most recent data
do suggest that reserves are still abundant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when
runoff began.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And the federal funds rate has been very steady within the target range.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We track
a, a bunch of metrics, and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do intend to
reduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that’s consistent with implementing monetary
policy efficiently and effectively in our ample-reserves regime.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re closely monitoring a, a
range of indicators to assess conditions, and that should provide signals whether reserves are
approaching a level that could be judged as, quote, “somewhat above ample.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I don’t have
anything to say to you about particular dates; it’s just that’s the process, and what we see is, is
that, that rates do appear to be abundant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to
support the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach
for reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On, on AI, it’s a big event in, in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, what, what really matters for us is macro developments, and that means
substantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t
put that label on, on these events, although of course we’re all watching it with interest.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist, thank you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You
mentioned in your remarks that activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the
same time, since your first rate cut in September, long-term mortgage rates have gone up by a
full percentage point, back above 7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering, kind of looking forward, do you
Page 18 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think—are you confident that activity will remain stable, given how elevated mortgage rates are?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How does it fit into your broader thinking about the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as you know, as we’ve reduced our, our policy rate 100 basis
points, longer rates have gone up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not because of expectations—not principally because of
expectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, and, you
know, it’s long rates that matter for, for housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I don’t think—I think these higher rates
are going to—they’re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent, if they’re
persistent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll have to see how long they persist.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we, we are—we control an
overnight rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Generally, it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including
interest rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But in this particular case, it’s all happened at a time when, for reasons unrelated
to our policy, longer rates have moved up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You said you want to see further progress on inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Given that households
appear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should
wait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I wouldn’t say that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we’ve never said we need to be all the
way at target to reduce rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>At, at any time, what we’re doing is we’re looking at the economy
and asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price
stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think if—we would want to see further progress, but we think our—we think
our—as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Meaningfully restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Not
highly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I would think we need to see further
Page 19 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although
we’d love to see that, of course, and we will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And a separate question for you, on tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Curious
whether the threat of tariffs and not knowing whether they could stick or not creates uncertainty
for business here in the United States and could cause them to pull back, ultimately weighing on
growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does the threat of tariffs cause you to ponder your growth forecast?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we—I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the
conduct of tariffs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s not our job, and it’s not our job to comment on the moves that
people make.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I wouldn’t want to criticize anything that’s happening or really comment on
it one way or another—praise it, for that matter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just not our job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do think that—you know, we found in, in 2018, [when] there was a lot of work done on
trade policy uncertainty, trade policy uncertainty, if it’s large and persistent, can start to matter
for businesses making investment decisions and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not something I’m
observing today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very early days for this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that did—I think that did matter in 2018–19.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and it’s one, you know, one of many things we’ll be watching.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Matt Egan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MATT EGAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Matt Egan from CNN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Following up on
Courtenay’s question from earlier about the stock market, how concerned are you, if at all, about
potential asset bubble brewing in financial markets?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do relatively high market valuations
factor into considerations about potentially lowering interest rates further?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that something
that’s in the back of your mind?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we look—we look at, from a financial stability perspective, at
asset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the
Page 20 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
banking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s just one of the four things,
asset prices are.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, yeah, I, I’d say they’re elevated by, by many metrics right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>A good
part of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we, we look at that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know,
we also—we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are
to those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective, and we think
that there’s a lot of resilience out there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Banks have high capital, and households are actually,
overall—not all households, but in, in the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape
financially these days.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s how we think about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, you know, we, we also—we look at
overall financial conditions, and you’ve got—you can’t just take—you can’t just take equity
prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve got to look at rates, too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in
conditions, with higher rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, overall, financial conditions are probably still somewhat
accommodative, but it’s a mixed bag.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>RICHARD ESCOBEDO.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m Richard Escobedo with CBS News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One question for you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>This month’s statement notes that unemployment has stabilized at a low
rate and that the labor market is solid.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You walked through some of what’s driving this, but I
wonder what risks you see that might challenge your assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, the things we watch, we discussed earlier.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One, one is, is that
there’s a low hiring rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And so that if, if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were
to start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the
hiring rate is quite low.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that’s one thing we look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s also—it’s worth pointing out that for lower-income households, they are—
they’re under significant pressure.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And in the aggregate, the numbers are good, but we know
Page 21 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that people at the lower end of the income spectrum are, are struggling with, with costs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And,
really, it’s, it’s high inflation for the basics of life.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>It’s not so much the inflation now; it’s the
price level, because inflation has raised prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation is now closer—much closer to target,
but people are really feeling that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, overall, this is a good labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Here
you’re at 4.1 percent unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s just a really good level, and you’ve been
solidly there now for six, seven months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold
the unemployment rate there, given, given that, you know, there’ll be much slower population
growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One more question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some of the uncertainty around
immigration policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is—in your assessment, is that making it harder for businesses and the Fed
to plan going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we hear anecdotal reports, but I, I don’t see—there’s
nothing in the data yet on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you do—you hear—you hear that kind of thing about
construction, for example.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant
labor are, are saying that it’s, it’s suddenly gotten harder to, to get people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I, again—I
know—you don’t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I’m wondering, are there any periods from your
career, or as it relates to markets, the economy, what’s going on here in Washington and beyond,
or from lessons from history, that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in
uncertain times like today?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 22 of 27

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess I’d say this: Uncertainty is, is with us all the time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it is
human nature, apparently, to underestimate the—how fat the tails are, in a way, that, you know,
the, the possibility—we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it’s not a
normal distribution.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your
expectations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s never not that way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t—you know, if you—if you think about it—
think about the first few months of the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are we going to be able
to reopen the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If so, when?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much of it?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How long will it take?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, that
was uncertainty.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we have now is a good labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have the economy growing at,
you know, 2 to 2½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation’s come down to, to now the, you know—the headline
inflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that’s what the public experiences.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at—we look
at core because it’s a better indicator of future inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, yes, the price level went up a lot for
inflation, and people are feeling that, and, and they’re not wrong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I—so the kind of
uncertainty we have is just a, a usual level of uncertainty about the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But then
policies—which are, you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise, really—those are—those are
policies which people are, have been elected to implement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re implementing them with a
view to, to making a better economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I, I don’t think—I wouldn’t call this out as, as a—
as one of those times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t compare it to the Global Financial Crisis or anything like that,
given that we have actually a very good economy right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>EVAN RYSER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Evan Ryser with Market News International.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, is a March
cut still on the table?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And then, additionally, are you looking to see better-than-expected data on
inflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 23 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, as, as I mentioned, the economy’s strong, the labor market’s
solid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation
continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That tells me and the other members of the
Committee—the broad sense of the Committee, actually, is that we don’t need to be in a hurry to
adjust our policy stance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your second question was?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Whether or not you need to see better-than-expected inflation data or
just inflation data that roughly aligns with your current forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, it’s one of those things we’ll know it when we see it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But
more, more the—the expectation is that we will make continued progress, and, you know, that’s
what we want.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we’ll know it when we see it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>When we—it, it’s going to have to be
something that isn’t just idiosyncratic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re going to want to see, you know, continued
progress with housing services inflation; you’re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way
that builds confidence that we are really making progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what it’s going to be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, I
mean, is, is that better than our expectations?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If we expect to see that, it’s just a question of
when.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Scott.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>SCOTT HORSLEY.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Scott Horsley from NPR.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In your five-year
review, you said the, the 2 percent inflation target won’t be on the table.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you talk a little
about why?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that because you think that’s the right target, or is it because you don’t want to
move the goalpost midgame, or what’s, what’s behind that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think to—I think that goal has served us well over a long period of
time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s also the sort of global standard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at
changing that, you wouldn’t do it at a time when you’re not meeting it anyway.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would not look
Page 24 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at changing it anyway, but I certainly wouldn’t look at, at it at a time when you’re not—when
you’re not meeting it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, there’s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if I’m being at all
unclear.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re not—we’re not going to change the inflation goal any time soon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And, and five years ago, if I can paraphrase what you all decided, it
was you’re going to not raise interest rates preemptively to, to head off inflation until you see
sort of the whites of the eyes of inflation, because the solid labor market was so beneficial.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Have
the last few years changed your thinking about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So what we really said was that we wouldn’t—we wouldn’t look at
a—at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So the
thought was that we’d seen really low levels of inflation—sorry, of unemployment—with no
sign of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So why would you preemptively want to—want to put people out of work in
the absence of, of any kind of—any evidence that suggested that, that this was not a sustainable
level?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was a way of, of acknowledging how much humility we have about, about the starred
variables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, that was a—that, that was an
insight.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll, we’ll discuss that again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’ll be one of the many things that we discuss.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I
don’t think that insight is wrong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We didn’t—you know, we, we—what we said was that, you
know, in—at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we, we would likely allow
inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That was—
turned out not to be relevant to what actually happened.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There was nothing moderate about the
overshoot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was—it was an exogenous event.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It was the pandemic, and it happened, and, you
know, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that
that’s what we should do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to—we, we
looked at the inflation as, as transitory, and—right up to the point where the data turned against
Page 25 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our, our view, and we raised
rates a lot, and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the
framework was, was more irrelevant than anything else.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The, the, that part of it—that part of it
was irrelevant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The rest of the framework worked just fine as, as we used it, as it supported what
we did to bring inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Go to Mark for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MARK HAMRICK.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hello, Chairman Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As you
know, in the annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, among the risks
outlined is cryptocurrency.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you talk about those risks now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And regarding individuals
and households, perhaps distinct from the concern about the financial system, do you worry that
speculation in this unregulated asset class could hurt their financial well-being, or do you think it
has a place in a household’s portfolio?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, so our, our role with Bitcoin, really, is to look at—with
crypto, really, is to look at the banks, and, and, you know, we, we think it’s—you know, banks
are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks
and its safe, safe and soundness.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Many of our—a good number of our banks that we regulate and
supervise do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, the threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto
activities, and that’s because they’re so new, and, you know, we don’t want to make the mistake
you’re—if you—if you’re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside
the federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it’s a safe
and sound activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we’re, we’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t
want to, to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, to terminate customers who are
Page 26 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
perfectly legal just because of, of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and
supervision, so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And with respect to households and their inclusion in that asset
class?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, you know, that’s, that’s kind of a—it’s not really our, our
bailiwick.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they
have, and that’s why we have, you know, the securities law, laws that we have.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s why, you
know, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want
households to have the chance to understand the risk that they’re taking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, I, I do
think it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think
that, that’s something Congress was working on quite a lot.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve actually spent a lot of time,
you know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on various things, and I, I
think that would be a very constructive thing for, for Congress to do.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our, our goals over the past two years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state and remains solid.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To that end, today, the Federal Open
Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by
lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We also decided to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a—at a solid
pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the
second quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in
equipment and intangibles has strengthened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been
weak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.
economy over the past year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants
generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over
the next few years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate is
higher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nominal
Page 1 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Overall, a
broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in
2019.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median
projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and
4.3 percent over the next few years.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and
2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thereafter, the median
projection falls to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds
rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼-4½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral
setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing
further progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>With today’s action, we
have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is
Page 2 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now significantly less restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further
adjustments to our policy rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their
individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each
participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median participant projects
that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and
3.4 percent at the end of 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These median projections are somewhat higher than in
September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These projections, however, are not a
Committee plan or decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If the economy remains strong and inflation
does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more
slowly.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly
than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Policy is well positioned to deal with the
risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility
to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate—its typical configuration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 3 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, and I look forward to your
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEANNA SMIALEK.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking
our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’s appropriate
to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what
would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Would a January cut potentially be
possible, or does a pause next month seem more likely?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and
then—and then move to 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it
was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of
our goals, maximum employment and price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We see the risks as two-sided: moving too
slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly
and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re trying to steer between those two
risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I’ll give you some
details on why.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 4 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is
now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and
orderly way.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold
unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as
surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor
market than there was, than we had in 2019.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s still quite gradually cooling.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we keep an
eye on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we’ve
made a great deal of progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November
is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Twelve—but 12-month inflation
has actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we
might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for
goods.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent
and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at
which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You ask about 2025.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year
really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that
inflation will be higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we
see as higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We’re, we’re going to react to data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks
is likely to be appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you
make those cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this
way: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re significantly closer to
neutral.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But as
for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as
continued strength in the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And as long as the economy and the labor market are
solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And all of that is reflected—to
your question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next
year, compared to four in September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the
opportunity to ask you a question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the
last transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in
part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s
the split on this one?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in,
and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I’d say—I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start—let
me start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place, and we think policy’s in a
really good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that
Page 6 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation has come down by 50 percent to, to—from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Headline
inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re actually in a really good starting place here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First
thing is growth is stronger, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so
far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next
year as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants
think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s, that’s more
strength, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation is higher, as we talked about.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation’s higher this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also higher in the
forecast next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another
reason to be cautious about, about further moves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but then getting to your—to your point,
there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some
people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of
economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some
people said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we
have people making a bunch of different approaches to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But some did identify policy
uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the
path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking
into a dark room full of furniture.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You just slow down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that may have affected some of
the people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 7 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and
uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The upside risk to inflation jumped quite
substantially.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the
disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The only
real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Is it fair to say that that’s what’s
driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What’s happened
is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in
September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, November is, is back on track.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, once again we’ve, you know,
we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached
the end of the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can tell you that
might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to
expectations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s way below
where it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I
mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s
in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing
inflation down and keeping a solid labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking
the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking
Page 8 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through” any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations
remained anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other
thinking on tariffs generally that you can share?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative
simulations are a good place to start.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I happened to have brought them here with me today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m
sure you have them too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you
know, it’s six-years-old analysis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right
questions to ask.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing
through,” one was not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see-
through” paragraph.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to
“see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not
be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we won’t face that
question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What the Committee’s doing now is, is
discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can
affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, we’re,
we’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it
puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make,
you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy
response.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Do you, given the recent bout
of inflation that we’ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and
businesses being—seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a
Page 9 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
little bit riskier to look through tariffs?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, are—do you feel that you have to respond more
quickly to inflation threats, given what we’ve seen the past few years?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative
simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs
will, will even go into consumer inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How persistent will that be?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, so, we
just—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very
premature to try to make any kind of conclusion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what
countries, for how long, and what size.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know,
retaliatory tariffs.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be
into consumer prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last
episode is or is not a good model for what happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You pointed out we’ve just been through a
period of high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve just gotten through that period.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a difference.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was also
quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that
may have affects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a
very careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how
they’re implemented.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re at the
stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions,
but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, to make sure
I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the
central tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the
Page 10 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So if inflation only declines next
year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let me—let me find these numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we have—we have inflation
coming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’d be—that’d
be significant progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see a slower path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that does take on board that we want to
see real progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation
down to that level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you
know, better than this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That would be meaningful.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We,
we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And while we, we have the
labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very
gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s also something we need to keep our
eye on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these
projections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing” language in the statement, which has
been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it’s going to be on hold for a
while, and they said, “Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,” would they
be mistaken to, to infer that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at
all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let me explain “extent and timing.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if
the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate
to slow the pace of rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can
reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Clearly, that distance has
shrunk by 100 basis points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s significantly smaller.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s the “extent” question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 11 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And, again, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor
market, to make those cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>“Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy
develops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of
adjustments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that’s what we mean by that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not trying to make decisions about the
longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, I
just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that
we expect significant policy changes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s nothing really unusual about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we need
to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll, we’ll have a
much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Even
though you’ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven’t seen much change in
mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You say you’re significantly restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you
running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of
a slowdown than you anticipate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are,
are really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,
but they’re also affected by many other things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And longer rates have actually gone up quite a
bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example,
mortgage rates more than short-term rates do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at that, but we look at all financial
conditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what we see happening in
the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth
Page 12 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for a very long time, and it keeps not happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have—we’re now well into another year
of growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It looks like it might be 2½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Third and—second and third quarters were right
about at the same level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Substantially
better than our global peer group.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I—there’s no reason to think a downturn is, is any
more likely than it—than it usually is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We have to stay on task, though, and
continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re also
going to be looking out for the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to keep the labor market pretty close to
where it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job
creation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so
that’s what our policy’s trying to achieve.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up by asking about—your formulation for
beginning rate cuts included the phrase “we need to have confidence that inflation is moving
down towards our target.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Given the fact that you’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you
have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve
made—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re, you
know, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than
that, we have been—for headline inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has
come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why
that portends well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You, again, you do see with housing
services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down
now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s
Page 13 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
nonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate
better with, you know, new leases that turn over.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not, not new tenants, but new leases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Market
rents is new leases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it
was before the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way
because of used cars and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we think, overall, that should generally be in the
range it was in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are
in, in good shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed
rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much
about the, you know, about tightness in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>They don’t really reflect that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, a
good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that,
that’s how that inflation works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s, it is cooler by so many measures
now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So
it’s not a source of inflationary pressures.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know,
particular professions where labor is tight.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses
of any significance from the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what’s the story?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that
the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in
insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing
insurance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we and most
other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It might
Page 14 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take another year or two from here, but I, I’m confident that that’s the path we’re on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So the
unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level
that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the
50 basis point cut in September.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But now
the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what has changed
about the Committee’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Is there just less
concern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now
needs to be accounted for?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in
July: 4.2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And job creation is, is
lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s been
steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would
hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you might—you might—if,
if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that
level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of
thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So gradually declining.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We, we do think the
labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s, it’s not
cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, you know, you pointed
out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative
Page 15 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it
doesn’t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, you know, we’re
watching it closely.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the
labor market is welcome here, what’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get
to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t need it, we
don’t think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few
months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent
months been moving sideways in the 12-month window.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so we’ve got to weigh them both,
at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused
on, on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we
think are broadly, roughly in balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that’s how we think about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word “recalibration”
today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this
new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it
was before.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we may get
around to that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I
said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis
points.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re significantly closer to neutral.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We still think where we are is meaningfully,
meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move
Page 16 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
cautiously and look for progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support
economic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that’s a good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think it would—I
support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think from now we are
in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it is kind of a new thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We moved pretty quickly
to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is
consistent with, with the SEP.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the
Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we’ve had in the recent inflation
numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the
avian flu, that, that kind of stuff.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation
coming down, as it did in the recent report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the
numbers we don’t like, you know?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], “Look, those
high months are wrong.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What about the low months?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’ve got, we have a very
low month, potentially, in November.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it’s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens
for core PCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that could be idiosyncratically low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We try to look—we try to look at not just
a couple or three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We shouldn’t have—our, our position shouldn’t change based on two
or three months of good or bad data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We have a long string now of inflation coming down
gradually over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it’s 12-month headline’s 2½; 12-month
core is 2.8.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s way better than we were.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We still have some work to do, though, is how
we’re looking at it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get—to get that work done,
we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 17 of 28

MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks Chair, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Financial markets
have been very buoyant, really all year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is the Committee comfortable with where financial
conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine
progress on your inflation target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s
part of what we do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our—
of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what we’ve seen over the
course of—just take the last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of
years—come down a lot.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That suggests that
our policy is restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected
by—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Housing activity is, is very low,
and that’s partly, significantly because of our policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we think our policy is working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
transmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, a
lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the
places where we’d expect to see it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do
you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, you know, we, we’re not allowed to own Bitcoin.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The Federal
Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re, we’re not looking for a, a law change.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the
kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 18 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’re confident
that we’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years
ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s pretty clear we’ve avoided a recession.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think growth
this year has, has been solid, it really has.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which
we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real
growth] this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is a really good number.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Again, the U.S. economy has just been
remarkable.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the
story, is that how well the U.S. is doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if you look around the world, there’s just a lot of
slow growth and continued struggles with inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I feel—I feel very good about where the
economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the—you, you
guys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>However, employment rates have
fallen rather quickly.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point—half a
percent, rather—recently.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The question, I guess, is, do you think there’s maybe more downside
momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t think so, no.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age
participation is still very high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is
low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you are looking
for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come
Page 19 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further
softening.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I didn’t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in
the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the
action, with, with an additional cut.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is
very low—again, participation is high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable
level—wage growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you
know, we want to keep it that way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Amara.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>AMARA OMEOKWE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just
want to put a finer point on the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Can you keep the labor market this way, in the
strong position that you have described, without further cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>In other words, do you still view
the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I,
I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in
balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, job creations are, are
meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be
sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you, if you take into account
the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to
2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the
downsides clearly appear to have diminished.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals,
Page 20 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually
cooling—gradually and in an orderly way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, that’s, that’s how I would
characterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks so much, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Elizabeth Schulze from ABC
News.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As you’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>High prices are
still a burden for so many households right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Why do you think it is that inflation is proving
to be more stubborn than you’d expected?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it
just has been a little bit more stubborn.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think if you go back two or three years, many people
were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you
know, high unemployment by now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path
down has actually been much better than many predicted.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We, we’ve managed to, to have the
unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come
down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a
12-month basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Why hasn’t it come down [more]?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around
the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents
have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two
years ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s part of it.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I
think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we, we
understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s
Page 21 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s
tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This was everywhere in all the
advanced economies at the same time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but
people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The best
we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and
keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their
wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year
upon year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what it
will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the
biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly,
I’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place; our
policy’s in a really good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I expect another good year next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward
Lawrence from Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you say that we’re closer to the neutral rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>What percent do
you see, and the Committee believes—where is that neutral rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll say a couple things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>First of all, when we, when we write—
the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate,
which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in
balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is not where we are right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when
we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you can’t do a
Page 22 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
straight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the
appropriate policy should be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and
we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s
having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are
lasting but not permanent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually
affect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re
looking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say,
we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points
closer to it right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot
closer to it, and I think we’re in a good place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re
going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little
more clarity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I, I think
the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where
that, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models
of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There, there are empirical models,
there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different
answers as you’d like.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there is no real certainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing
to know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh,
Page 23 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I think this model or this estimate is right.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You, you just have to be open to, you know, the
empirical data that are coming in and also how it’s affecting the outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s not made any
easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s
appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to,
to neutral, and we’ll do so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these
cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make
progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>VICTORIA GUIDA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just wanted to make sure I
understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Are you saying that progress
on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then also,
since that’s what’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Why, why do
you all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is
headline inflation, because that’s what people experience.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People don’t experience core
inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s the overall
goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can
fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really
good predictors of future inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of
overall inflation than overall inflation is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at core inflation because it’s a better
measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of
Page 24 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what inflation pressures exist.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s—it’s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know,
our goal is headline, not core.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So your question was, your second question was what?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially
ticking up?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mm-hmm.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and
food prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with
forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year,
then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it—that, that’s why
the two can go in different directions.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year,
but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything
about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’re thinking about
energy prices?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know,
but—really carefully, rather.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven’t really—
nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking
about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary
statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the price of
oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we
Page 25 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly,
at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it remains, you know, a risk.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>KELLY O’GRADY.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Kelly O’Grady from CBS News.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I want to
go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
wasn’t the case for some time, of course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s partly why Americans haven’t felt much relief in
their wallets from prices yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in
closing that gap could go away?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months
of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we, what we had was—we had
four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then
November is much lower.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising
upside risk to inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I think inflation is much lower.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What the public is feeling, and they’re
right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your,
your real compensation is growing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in other words, your compensation’s growing
meaningfully faster than inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just
want to hold onto it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what’s
going on right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation
really signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You
previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s now been pushed out to

2027.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You said you’re focused on enabling further progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not necessarily
progress in the right direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you confident that target isn’t going to move further out?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you
know, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Very high
uncertainty.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently
predict where the economy is going to be in three years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So what we’re doing is we’re looking at
what’s happening now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are
happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods
and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their,
their prior level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces
come together.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s every reason to think that they will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The timing of it is highly uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit
frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, we’re still on track.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d
said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people
would be, would say, “I’ll take that.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job’s
not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Go to Nancy for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer from
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it
appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you think the Fed is just going to
have to settle for that and accept that you’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 27 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, we’re not going to settle for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think we’re, we’re, you
know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we’ll get inflation back
sustainably to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That is—and I am confident we will achieve that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has taken longer,
but it’s, you have to be—you know, we are making progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have made a great deal of
progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we owe
the public.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, we’re committed to achieving it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’re at 4.3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>That’s, that’s
meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make
progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—Thank you very much.</del></p>

<h2>Common sentences</h2>
<p class="hawkish">Good afternoon.</p>
<p class="neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</p>
<p class="hawkish">In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</p>
<p class="dovish">Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</p>
<p class="dovish">We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on
both sides of our mandate.</p>
<p class="dovish">We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on
inflation.</p>
<p class="dovish">At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</p>
<p class="dovish">In considering the extent and timing of additional
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p class="hawkish">We’re not on any preset course.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</p>
<p class="hawkish">We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</p>
<p class="neutral">We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</p>
<p class="hawkish">Thank you.</p>
