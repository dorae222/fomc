CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Inflation has
eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting
downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As labor market tightness has eased and
progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals
are moving into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In
our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to
slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over
the next two years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December,
reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to
come into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs
per month.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Strong job
creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in
participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Although the jobs-to-
workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>FOMC
participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this
year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile
food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent
next year, and 2 percent in 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 2 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks
to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We believe that
our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves
broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some
point this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to
inflation risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for
longer, if appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation
back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering any adjustments to the target range
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce
the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down
toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an
unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will
continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this
Page 3 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026, still above the medium—
median longer-term funds rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion
since the Committee began reducing our portfolio.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At this meeting, we discussed issues related
to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>While we did not make any decisions
today on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of
runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The decision to slow the pace
of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would
otherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability is
essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long
term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We, at the
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</strong></em></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman, the projections show
somewhat higher core inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>They also show somewhat stronger growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>What should we
infer from this notion that, on average, rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher
and growth is higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness
to slow the economy to achieve that target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, it doesn’t—no, it doesn’t mean that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What it means is that, you
know, we’ve seen incoming—as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our
growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing, performing
well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused
people to write up their inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on
bringing inflation down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>When you—just to follow up: When you say that you’re willing to
either maintain the rate for longer, is—what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation
coming in above its 2 percent target?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Markets believe we will
achieve that goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen
over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we stress “over time.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do
show that happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is
Page 5 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming, but it still hasn’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that challenge
your assumption about when the shift will finally break through, since it hasn’t at that point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower
market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation
over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real
confidence that they will show up eventually over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, again, uncertainty about the exact
timing of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if
housing doesn’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this
year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into
a new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this
year, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are
suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some
combination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before
the pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, during your
congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest
rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest
rates are well above neutral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first
cut is highly consequential.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you reconcile these views for me?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If rates are well above
Page 6 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that because you anticipate one cut
would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019,
which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our—
in my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We—we’re in a situation where,
you know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if
we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to be careful.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation
coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
really what I was thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>How much of that inflation that we’ve seen so far this year do you
chalk up to one-off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some
change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about
dismissing data that we don’t like.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—
so I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers
were quite high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But,
nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The February number was high,
higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which
is not terribly high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s not like the January number.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I take the two of them together, and
I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down
gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think that story has changed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
Page 7 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also don’t think that those readings added to anyone’s confidence that we’re moving closer to, to
that point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we didn’t—the last thing I’ll say is we didn’t excessively celebrate
the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We didn’t take too much
signal out of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you
know—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to
these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>ANN SAPHIR.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, yes, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Could you speak a little bit more about the
timing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there enough data between now and, say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence
that you say you still need?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or, by June, is there enough data for you?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just give us a sense of
your thinking there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we make decisions meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we didn’t
make any decisions about future meetings today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those are going to depend on our ongoing
assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I really don’t
have anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean just a question of—I mean, is there even enough data for you to
be able to—
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting
period, if you look back—unexpected things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss
anything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I also mentioned—and
we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data,
particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of
Page 8 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
reducing rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Again, I don’t—there’s nothing in the data pointing at that, but those are the
things that we’ll be looking at, at coming meetings and—without trying to refer to any specific
meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In
the projections, there is an increase in the neutral rate, as you know, and higher rates—¼ point
higher rates projected in 2025, 2026.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you speak about why, [what] might be behind that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is
there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will
be needed in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and
’26.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I
don’t think we know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the
pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important,
slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that
don’t move quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I don’t think we know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not
go back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long-
run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t see rates going back
down to that level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>CHRIS RUGABER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On the projections, you also
have 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s already at—or you mentioned it
being 2.8 in February.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, that doesn’t sound like much disinflation at all.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So are you really,
are you still confident or—at the last press conference, you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you
Page 9 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would get more confidence at the end of this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Is it right to say that this suggests you’re not
seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we’ve seen 2023 and so forth?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen
so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think that—sorry, say your
last part of your question again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you still optimistic that you’ll get the confidence you need this
year?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is
still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate
cuts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The other thing is, in the
second half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make
progress as you move that 12-month window forward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that
confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence
that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking our
questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to
potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in
the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And just in general, if labor supply
continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly
stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of
demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re
spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last
Page 10 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In fact, they
were decreasing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So you can have that if you have a continued supply-side activity that we had
last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to
hold off on rate cuts?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, not all by itself.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, we saw—you saw last year very
strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We now have a better sense that a big part of
that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, in and of
itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NEIL IRWIN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Neil Irwin with Axios.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you assess the state of
financial conditions right now, and particularly—in particular, do you view the kind of easing in
financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you’re trying to
achieve on the inflation mandate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we think—there are many different financial conditions
indicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But,
ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think
you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling
off a little bit from the extremely high levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there I would point to job openings, quits,
surveys, the hiring rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Things like that are really demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are also supply-side things
happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we saw—that’s been
a question for a while.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite
financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.</strong></em></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Can you
give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What
we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there
more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And also
housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go
down, and they don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve
raised your inflation forecast?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking
the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think
many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, again, you don’t
want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the question is, what are we going to
see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger
inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to—
we’re going to let the data show.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the
road or something more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll have to find out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In the meantime, the economy is strong, the
labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach
this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at
2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 12 of 24

MICHAEL MCKEE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that
inflation is continually moving down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Have the recent numbers we’ve gotten for inflation data
dented that confidence at all?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised
anyone’s confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of
inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that’s what you still see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve
had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a
bumpy ride.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We consistently said that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they
more than bumps?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we just don’t—we can’t know that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s why we are approaching this
question carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation
sustainably down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the
historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the
first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately—
prematurely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Go to Edward.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence with FOX
Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from—well, the Federal Reserve is an
independent body, understanding Congress has oversight over that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You received a letter from
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said—calling on you to lower interest
rates—to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too
long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant
climate and economic benefits from these projects.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So has higher interest rates caused that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 13 of 24

CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Have they—well, first of all, I respect our—you know, in our system
of government, it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We place a
tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them
with great respect.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>In this case, I would say, those are, you know—our mandate is for maximum
employment and price stability and the other things that we do, and that’s what we’re trying to
accomplish.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we’re seeing, the
strong labor market we’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly
important, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for
those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying
that the higher rates are squeezing the working people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do these letters affect what you
guys are doing, policy-wise?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses
and address concerns.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system
of government, have oversight over our activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take
that on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”—
which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the
payment system: the things that we do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks a lot for the
opportunity to ask a question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the
Page 14 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting
rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to
achieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People do dissent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s something that happens.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Life
goes on, and it’s not a problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve always had dissents.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But—and so I—you know, you
respect thoughtful dissents very much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but
you really want to understand them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you may read a book that takes a position that you have
long opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I treat dissents with real respect
as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you hear me?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Great.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Obviously, inflation is some ways away from
target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Unemployment, though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in
February, we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Are you
concerned at all that—notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth—that in fact there may be
some cracks appearing in the employment market?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You talked about a significant deterioration
in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What would constitute that in your books?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We all
monitor the labor market very, very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I don’t see those cracks today.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, you
know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but
the overall picture really is a strong labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The extreme imbalances that we saw in the
Page 15 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’re seeing high job growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’re seeing big increases in supply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You’re seeing strong wage growth, but wage growth is
gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In many, many respects, the things are
returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
job openings and quits.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this:
You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How hard is it—how easy it is to find
a worker?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those have both—those surveys have both come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, you do see things like the low—
the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that
would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, initial claims are very, very
low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—watching it carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Don’t see it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So,
you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I
think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s just—that’s just people’s
forecast, individual forecasts.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s
where I’ll leave it, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>STEVE MATTHEWS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You mentioned at the
beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the
pace of asset runoff fairly soon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m wondering is—when you say fairly soon, does that mean
that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that
soon?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is
Page 16 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
discussing here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re at $95 billion of caps right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would that be cut about in half or
something in that nature?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not
discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will discuss those in due course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There isn&#39;t much runoff among
MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re talking about going to a lower
pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an
agreement or decision, but that’s the idea.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what we’re looking at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than
that, but you get the idea.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually
be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there can be times when, in the aggregate,
reserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And those parts where they’re not
ample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the
stress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then it would be very hard to restart, we think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So something like that happened in
’19 perhaps.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what we’re doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re looking at what would be a good time and what
would be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And will there be a discussion about returning to an all-
Treasuries balance sheet at some point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that
is mostly Treasuries.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other
issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not
Page 17 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
urgent right now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to get this, this decision made first and then we can, when the time is
right, come back to the other issues.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Also on the balance sheet, you
know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your
balance sheet plans?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you worry that, as deposits start to shrink, that we could see more
turbulence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’ll be watching carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But one of the reasons
we’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we
want to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking-
sector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is our second time in
doing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to
happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle
where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t want to do that again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the
banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the
administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those sorts of
things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, is it also because you’re not sure exactly how the reserve
supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near—at zero?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight
[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet
Page 18 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
shrinks, we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar-for-dollar with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s what we think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Jean.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEAN YUNG.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask
also about the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Will you—you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a
smaller balance sheet size.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does that mean you don’t have to make a decision on when to end
QT at this point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner, or will you
wait until we’re close to the end?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
that’s the idea.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk
of kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the
process prematurely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully
money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about
reserves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re
aiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So there isn’t a—
you know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think
we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be looking at what these—
what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the
ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then, though, you reach a point ultimately
where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s
another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and
that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you have a, you know, a slower pace of
runoff, which we’ll have fairly soon.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Then you have another time where you effectively hold the
Page 19 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
balance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then that ultimately
brings you, ideally, in for—brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above—you know,
above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not trying for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We
want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we
have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did
in 2019 and ’20.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>MICHELLE SMITH: Nancy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Chair
Powell, you said you’re waiting to become more confident that inflation’s getting to your
2 percent goal before you cut rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you just sum up more specifically what data you’re
looking at that would give you that confidence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming
inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the
various components—so obviously that’s what we want.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We want more confidence that
inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, I mean, of course we’ll also be
looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll look at the totality of the
data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the most important thing
will be the inflation data coming in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, are there things that you would give more
weight to, like wages?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Wages is one thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t—our target is not wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s really
inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But, but
Page 20 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
they’ve been—wage increases, that’s to say—wage increases have been quite strong, but they’re,
they’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s what
we want.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think,
by mostly by wages.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That wasn’t really the story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But we do think that, to get inflation back
down to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of
wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Greg.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, could you say
at this meeting whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than—
about rates—than there were at the last meeting?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Was there—was there that sense of maybe it’s
smart to wait?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming
inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we
were right to wait until we’re more confident.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone
dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think, generally
speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we
approach this question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Brendan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>BRENDAN PEDERSEN.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl
News.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve been hearing a lot
from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know
you have said to Congress that you’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything—
launches anything.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is
Page 21 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you
give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will—
I’ll try harder.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a
conclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to
authorize a digital dollar.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to
give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the
public.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re just a long, long way from that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What we are doing, and I think what every
major central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital
finance, and it has many, many different areas.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has applications in wholesale finance, in the
payment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front
burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we actually
do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on
a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to
spring it on Congress at the right moment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a
decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just think it’s something we
need to be—we need to understand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of
the broader payments landscape.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Mr. Chairman,
April 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news
conferences.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper

functioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And is there more that
you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what might that look like?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years
ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the
public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’ll react
to the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and
greater transparency.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman
Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I. You know, so we went from four press conferences a
year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that’s a good innovation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
wouldn’t want to turn it back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We also have done a bunch of other things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we have an annual supervision
report, Financial Stability Report.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think
you—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re very transparent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public
through the media.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so that channel is full, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think it’s generally broadly
helped and made things better.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But not every day and in every way.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, to follow up: Has there ever been a day where you wanted to
put that genie back in the bottle somewhat?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course not. [</strong></em></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Jennifer, for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but you did say earlier
in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
Page 23 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not
far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So are you still of
that belief or not?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What are we to take by those words, “not far?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of
hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that
inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will
be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I said that
any number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We repeated that
today in our statement.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we
had made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation
that that progress will continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last
year that were really much lower.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s what I had in
mind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But given that you said that PCE for February,
2.8 percent the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE—core PCE coming down by a tenth
of a percent every month, I mean, wouldn’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June, July,
to a point where you could cut then?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We would, of
course, love to get great inflation data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We got really good inflation data on the second—in the
second part of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Again, we didn’t overreact to it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We said we needed to see more, and
we said it would be bumpy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a
couple of times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly
welcome it.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
January 31, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased
from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s very good news.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past two years, we’ve significantly tightened the stance
of monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory,
and we’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As labor market tightness
has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and
inflation goals are moving into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have more to say about monetary policy—
about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed
investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 1 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a
pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate remains low
at 3.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of
workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic
levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The lower inflation
readings over the second half of last year are welcome.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But we will need to see continuing
evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-
term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of
surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and
we’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our restrictive stance of
Page 2 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the
economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy
restraint at some point this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since
the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The
economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re prepared
to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We know that
reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve
seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>At
the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic
activity and employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the
balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target
range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-run—longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 3 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our
questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’t
want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming—coming down
fully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wonder—what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And as you
make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data
against the sort of solid inflation progress you’ve been seeing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry—say that last part again.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>How are—how are you weighing the growth data and
consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let
me say that we have confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is
moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been
increasing, but we want to get greater confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What do we want to see?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to see
more good data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not that we’re looking for better data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—we’re looking at continuation
of the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have six months
of good inflation data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it
sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent
inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the answer will come from some more data that’s also good
Page 4 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t—it’s not that the six-month data isn’t—isn’t low enough.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s just a
question of, can we take that with confidence that we’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s really what we’re thinking about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve
had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth
quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in
economic activity—that hasn’t been the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger
growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t look at it as a problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We want to see a strong labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not looking for a weaker labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re
looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six
months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could just follow up very quickly, the—when,
when you say that you want to make sure that it’s a true signal, is there anything that you’re
seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it’s a true signal at this stage?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>No, I think it’s—I, I would say it, it seems—it seems to be the likely
case that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven’t yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so—I mean, it’s a good story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have six months of good inflation [readings].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But you
can—and you know this—you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it’s
been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly
negative.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably
approximate zero.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, in
other words, what we care about is the aggregate number—not so much the composition.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But
Page 5 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we, we just need to see more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s where we are, as a Committee.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We need to see more
evidence that sort of confirms what we think we’re seeing and that tells us that we are on—gives
us confidence that we’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, it seems to
me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One was the risk of a wage–
price spiral.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This
morning’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private-sector payroll growth running at a
sub–4 percent pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation
emergency of the last three years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, given that you appear to have substantially cut off these
two tail risks and that you’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory,
what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are you really going to learn
more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does
believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for—partly for the reasons that you say.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Growth has been strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor
market is strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really
confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of
dialing back the restrictive level.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, overall, I think—I think people do believe—and, as you
know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But I think to get to that place
where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in
fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
NICK TIMIRAOS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could ask differently: If, if you hold rates high as inflation
moderates, as it—as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its
variants.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by
those rules in the current instance?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor
rules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We consult them regularly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re in our, our
Tealbook, and, and they’re in all the materials that we look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, I don’t think
we’ve ever been at a—at a place where we were—where we were setting policy by them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
there—depending on the rule, it will tell you different things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are many different
formulations.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates
go up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that doesn’t mean we can
mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It doesn’t mean that
at all, because, for one thing, we, we don’t know—we, we look at more than just the fed funds
rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We look at—broadly—financial conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, in addition, we don’t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is
at any given time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that also doesn’t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the
economy turn down, because that would be too late.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re really in a risk-management
mode: of managing the risk—as I mentioned in my opening remarks—managing the risk that we
move too soon and move too late.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I think to move, which is—which is where almost
everyone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of
that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 7 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks, Chair Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’d like you to, to key in on the
use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “remains elevated.”</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’ve pledged to cut
rates before inflation reached 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that implies that there’s some sort of intermediate
step here on, on inflation and that a, a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement
language that inflation “remains elevated.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What’s the step-down from there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yeah, I, I don’t know that we’ve worked out the particulars—
statement language and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at
where, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent,
for example—12-month—which is way down from where it was.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Very, very positive
development—very fast decline—and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue
to come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, so that’s where—that’s where it is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re, you know, we’re wanting to
see, you know, more data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows
that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’t mention the
other side of the mandate—a slide in employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Would a slide in employment also bring you
to the point of, of cutting rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So let me say that we’re not looking for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not
something we’re looking for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, yes, if you think about, you know—in, in the base case, the
economy is performing well—the labor market remains strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>If we saw an unexpected
weakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Absolutely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things—would
argue for moving later.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we
have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth—we have a strong labor market—we
Page 8 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have inflation coming down—that’s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And in that case, what we’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage
of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just to circle back to the “greater
confidence” aspect of the statement, there’s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just
wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is there unanimity
or, at least, consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater
confidence is?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you
know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence
to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “greater confidence”
threshold could be reached?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re not—we’re not really at that stage.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we’re—
we’re—there was no proposal to cut rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some people did, you know, talk about their view of
the rate path.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence
of where people are, although it is—it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So, you know,
we’re not—we’re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we
weren’t actively considering, you know, a—moving, moving the federal funds rate down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will
say, there is a—there is a wide disparity—a healthy disparity—of views, and you see that in
public, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they’re released every five
years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that’s actually essential for making
good policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other—
Page 9 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we, we compromise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’re able to—for the
most part—able to join in.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>To me, that’s a well-functioning public institution.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, over the past few years, there have been all these real-time
indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like
OpenTable data or office attendance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve talked about vacancies in the past.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I’m
wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that’s giving you the
clearest picture of the economy—including on rents—if you could touch on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Including?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Rent costs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, so we’re not—you know, it’s not the pandemic, so we
can actually rely on more, more traditional forms.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People are working.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re getting wages,
and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I
wouldn’t say we’re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you
point to rents.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Which
would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So
the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as
measured, measured in PCE inflation?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s just a question of when and,
and how big it’ll be.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that will—that
will help.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of
disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some
Page 10 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
more time to run.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, these—the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they
were.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, it takes time for the, the healing process to get into prices.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there may be
still a tailwind.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll find out with, with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we look at the things that relate to our
mandate very carefully, and—as you would imagine.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess, just as a quick follow-up—do you feel comfortable at this
point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more
confidence?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I, I think
we have—we have a ways to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above
target on a 12-month basis.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Twelve months is our, our target, certainly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m encouraged, and
we’re encouraged by the progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring
victory at all at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think we have a ways to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>STEVE LIESMAN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’ve said that you would know the
neutral rate by its works.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I’m wondering what you could tell me—how do you believe the
neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In other words, how
much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And how much
restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s—I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the
economy—you do see, for example, housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You see the effects.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your, your second
question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through—a lot of
the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor
market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you’ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other
Page 11 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
cycles and has brought that working with tighter, tighter policy, which has enabled the supply
side to recover—I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, no—we
really do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would point to the
interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s a—it’s a joint
story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a complicated story.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the
economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s—so I think it’s, it’s—of course, you know that it’s not something
you can identify with any precision.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But if you—a standard approach would be to take the
nominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If
you do that—and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like
to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream
estimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but at the same time, you look at
the economy, and you say, “This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and you
say, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate?”</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>What’s happening, though, is, the supply
side has been recovering in the middle of this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that won’t go on forever.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So a lot of the
growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and
demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and
supply chains healing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you
know, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>RICH MILLER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you—sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You mentioned earlier we’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you
Page 12 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
talk a little bit more about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote,
unquote, “normal” and that the—we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming
back down to what they were pre-pandemic?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Even with today’s ECI levels, they were still above
those pre-pandemic levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing
normal—but not totally back to normal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you pointed to one or more of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think,
you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Wages—wage increases, rather,
are not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I, I would
look at it this way, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that process will probably take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So wage setting is something that happens—it’s,
it’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s okay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s okay.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that
wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving
back to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are
more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s, it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one—
and, and, you know, I think we’re, we’re moving in the right direction.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market,
basically, you’re saying?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s
rebalancing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Clearly, that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers
and supply at the beginning of the pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we lost several million workers at the
beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then when the
economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just—it
Page 13 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was everywhere—panic on the part of businesses—couldn’t, couldn’t find people.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, what’s
happened is—we expected labor—the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it
didn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well,
maybe we won’t get it back.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then 2023, we did, as you know—so labor force participation
came back strongly in ’23, and so did immigration.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Immigration came to a halt during the
pandemic.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor
market to what is still a very strong labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s still a good labor market for wages and for
finding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, you know,
one great way to look at that is what’s happening with, with wage increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you see it now
across the, the major things that we—that we track.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a
clear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with
where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I
wanted to follow up on Rich’s question.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It sounded like you suggested that you’re not worried
about faster growth so much—so wanted to see if you’re seeing anything that suggests that
inflation could reaccelerate from here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And it sounds like you’re saying you’re not worried that
solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would
reaccelerate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the, the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level
meaningfully above 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s, to me, more likely.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, if—if inflation were
to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that, and that would—
Page 14 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that would be a surprise at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I have to tell you, that’s why we keep our options open
here and why we’re not, you know, rushing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I think both of those are risks, but I think the
more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you’ve had six good months—very good
months—but what, what’s really going to “shake out” here?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, where—what will—
when we look back, what will we see?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Are the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat
themselves?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t think so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We don’t—you know, that’s not what we think, but that’s the
question we are asking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And just one quick follow-up—Governor Waller had
mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that something
you’re watching as well?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if, if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you
more confidence where things are going?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll just have to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll—we look at those.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Last year
was a—was a, a surprise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you don’t
want to use the term “soft landing,” would you say, at least, that, from your point of view now,
the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risks have
diminished very much?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And you mentioned below–2 percent inflation for—on a three-month
basis, core PCE has been running at 1½ percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there are those on Wall Street who think
that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation
running below your target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you see that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 15 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, how to—your first question—how to describe where we are?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So
I guess I would just say this—executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over
the course of last year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market—3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor
market is strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’ve had just about two years now of, of unemployment under 4 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That hasn’t happened in 50 years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s a good labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And we’ve seen inflation come
down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve talked about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an
expectation that there’s more to come.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is a—this is a good situation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s be honest.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This is a—this is a good economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But what’s the outlook?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That’s looking in the rearview—the outlook—we do expect
growth to moderate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’t happened, but
we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its
course.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market is rebalancing, as, as I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Job creation has slowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The base
of job growth has narrowed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, of course, 12-month inflation is, is above target and getting,
you know, getting down closer to target.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on
track for that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those are the risks and, and questions we have to answer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, overall, this is a
pretty good picture.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It, it is a good picture.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Your second question was—sorry.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Could you get inflation that is below target—end up with inflation
below target, and you have to do something about that?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the
2 percent base once.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And the same
thing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s
annualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re not—you know, we’re not
looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 16 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So if we do face those circumstances, then we’ll have to deal with that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think—I think as of
now, you know, the, the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish
the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you,
Mr. Chairman, for taking this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, as I’ve—as I’ve heard from some District Fed presidents, is
it, in your view, a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then
when we do see that first rate cut, is that—should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate-cut
cycle, or is it a one-off?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I’ll point you to that language on your first question.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We, we
included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor
market, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when
to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if you take that to the current
context—current context, we’re going to be data dependent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to be looking at this
meeting by meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely
that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify
March as the time to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s, that’s to be seen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wouldn’t call—you know, when
you say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say I
don’t think that’s—that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base
case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And your second question is—
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On, on the—is this the start of a—when we see a cut, is it the
start of a cutting cycle, or is it—could it just be a one-off?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 17 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, that’s going to depend on the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The whole thing is,
this is going to depend on the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects
the outlook and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re going to make our decisions based on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
it could wind up—you know, we’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting, and, and
people will write down what they think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, in the end, it’s really going to depend on how the
economy evolves.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower—for
example, stronger inflation—more, more persistent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There are risks that would cause us
to—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or—and sooner.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And that would be a
weakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those
are the kinds of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re just—we’re just going to be reacting to the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s the—
that’s really the only way we can do this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Victoria Guida with Politico.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Could you talk a little bit more
about productivity growth?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, you’ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the
level of wage growth that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve obviously seen, you
know—you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it’s cooled a little bit but still sort of
above what you wanted to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth has been very strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How much of those numbers do
you attribute to productivity?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because
of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about—or do you think that
productivity growth will, will fade over time?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is a really interesting question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I think—my, my own
view is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as
workers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then you saw a deep trough
Page 18 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of productivity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, over the last—you saw high productivity last year, in ’23.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think
we’re, we’re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the question
will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on,
you know, fundamental aspects of our economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is there—is there a case—will it be the case
that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What would it take?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is
that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work
from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or AI, artificial intelligence—
generative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So
I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say
that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and
out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Right.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So would that be behind why we’ve seen such strong
growth, but we’ve also seen inflation fall—that maybe there’s just a higher level of productivity?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s one way to look at it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to ask a little bit more about housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>I’m wondering—how closely are you
watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And it seems
like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So when we think about, you know—our, our statutory goals are
maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re targeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not targeting
housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Those are very important
Page 19 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
things for people’s lives.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But they’re not—you know, those are not the things we’re targeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the
housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And when we raise rates,
the housing industry can be hurt, because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
we have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And these are not—these are not things that
we have any tools to address.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our
work is inflation, which is a combination.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It’s, it’s really rental inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re taking owners’
equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you’re, you’re running that through the
CPI calculation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And what that’s telling
you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will
show up in inflation over time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has to as long as that remains the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And just real quick—what is your response to the
letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to
make housing more affordable?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job—the
job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Price stability is
absolutely essential for people’s lives, most importantly for—well, not most importantly—most,
mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the
margins.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so someone—for someone like that, high inflation in the—in the necessities of
life—right away, you’re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know,
some scope to absorb higher costs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we have to get—it’s our job.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s what society has asked
Page 20 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
us to do, is to get inflation down, and the tools that we use to do it are interest rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s
how we think about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you give us some insight
into whether the Committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the
months ahead?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has
gone very well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And as the process has continued, you know, we’re getting to that time where
questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So at
this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we’re planning to begin in-
depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So those, those
questions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’re, we’re at the
beginning of that process, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Quick follow-up—is it the case that the Fed would decide to
lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so they
don’t—for example, if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but
continuing to run off the balance sheet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In both cases, that’s normalization, but from a strict
monetary policy standpoint, you could say we’re loosening along with tightening.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So that, that
could happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about, but right now, we’re
thinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ll—we’ll be looking into that as a Committee
starting in March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 21 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
COURTENAY BROWN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, Chair
Powell.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build
up confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’t
start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Roughly how many months do you think you might need of, of good inflation data to be—to be
confident?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m just going to
say—and it’s not that we don’t have any confidence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We, we have growing confidence, but not
to the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the
process of, of dialing back on restriction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we want to get that right, and we feel like the
strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We think that’s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we’ve made a lot
of progress on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable
way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s how we’re thinking about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of when that’ll be, you know, that, that’ll all
come out of our communications, and, you know, we won’t—we won’t keep that a secret.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>EVAN RYSER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Evan Ryser with MNI Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you
explain a little bit more on what you’re considering when tapering QT?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you need to see the
overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with
a couple hundred billion dollars there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not a decision that we’ve made, but I, I wouldn’t think we’d, we’d
be—we wouldn’t be taking a position that it’s got to go to zero.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, if it—if it were to
stabilize at a different level—but that’s, that’s not a decision that we’ve made.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s
what we’ll be talking about at the March meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>A whole range of issues will be briefed up,
and the Committee will get into—get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of
the next, let’s say, year or so.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, I want to change
gears a little bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the presidential primary campaign that’s been going on for the last nine
months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates had said that they
probably wouldn’t want to give you a third term.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you want another term—you’ve had—on the Fed?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What, what’s your stance on that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t have a stance on that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s not something I’m focused on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>[We’re] focused on doing our jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have—this year is going to be a highly consequential
year for, for the Fed and for monetary policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re, all of us, very buckled down, focused
on doing our jobs.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jennifer.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over
the past six months.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year, at 2.4
percent, compared to that six-month measure.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given that forecast and that the median is for
three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it’s been over the last six months
for the next six months?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 23 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I—you know, we’re going to do—we’ll update our, our inflation
forecasts at the next meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You referred to the December meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s, you know,
three months old [by March], so it might be lower now, given the data we’ve gotten.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, look, as
I mentioned, we’re going to be reacting to the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If, if we get—if we get very strong inflation
data and it, it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we’ll go slower or later or both.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>If we got really
good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the—that, that would tell us that, that we
could go sooner and perhaps go faster.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re just going to be—but, of course, we’ll weigh
that with all the other factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re setting policy based on the totality of, of the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But just to follow—if inflation stays where it is currently,
that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Would that mean
you’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, I think if we—if we came to the view that, that inflation
were—that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in “PCE
world”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be, then,
yes, our policy would be in a different place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It would.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But, you know, that’s the whole point is,
we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a
sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Daniel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>DANIEL AVIS.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Daniel Avis, Agence France-Presse.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I just wondered
if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It seems to suggest that
consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just
wonder—is it fair to say that they’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in
Page 24 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
recent months?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has
played a role in that?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And what challenges do you see, going forward?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys
have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a
couple of years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve asked ourselves why
that is.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on
this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So prices went up much more
than 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And people are going to the store, and
they’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they’re not happy about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And it’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price—the
prices they’re paying are still high.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that, that is what—that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
they’re, they’re right to be unhappy.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, this is why we need to keep price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
why we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of [surveys]—you’re right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of—you’ve
seen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the
economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess that’s a good thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That can—that can support spending—can support
economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s some evidence of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you
know, a meaningful increase.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve
been at various times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it’s—they certainly have come up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Bryan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>BRYAN MENA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Bryan Mena, CNN Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Committee members have said they’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in
Page 25 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large
revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the
economy being quarterly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So did any members say they’ve learned anything not reflected in the
data?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’t been
captured in the data yet?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Well, yes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we, we do meet
with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I always feel like
you—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual
companies—individual management teams—and then building out from that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so, starting
with GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very hard.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I, I really like anecdotal data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks
have really the best network of anyone.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In all their Districts, they’re talking to, you know, not
just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit
community.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They have arms into all of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so when they come back—that’s what goes
into the Beige Book.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during
the outlook go-around, they’ll say, “In my District . . .”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And they’ll talk about 100 conversations
they—not—they won’t talk—they, they will give you input, based on 100 conversations that
they’ve had with people of all different walks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And it’s—I personally find it very helpful in
understanding what’s going on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the
data sometimes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Did any of them—did any of them notice slowing economy based on
what they’ve heard from, like, their District?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 26 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, if you—if you look back at the last—not this Beige
Book, but the one before, it was more—there was a lot of “slower activity.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that, that
what you’re hearing now is, is, things are picking up a bit.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re hearing—not, not in every
District and not every, every person that we talk to, but you’re—overall, it feels like you’re
hearing things picking up at the margin.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what comes through.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEFF COX.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you, sir.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Just kind of looking to put it all
together: You talked about basically the, the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent
annualized growth in the fourth quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to
you now than any inflation threat might?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, you know—you’re in a position, in other words,
to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’re more—you’re more tilted
towards that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too
strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m not so worried about that.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You know, it’s—again, we’ve had
inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in
unemployment, and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if
it’s going to continue.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>So I, I am—you know, I think—I think declining inflation—continued
declines in inflation are, are really the main thing we’re looking at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Of course, we want the labor
market to remain strong, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We don’t have a growth mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a,
a price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth only matters to the
extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thank you very much.</del></p>
