Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on December 18, 2024:
• The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the
interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.4 percent, effective December 19, 2024. <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p>• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
domestic policy directive:
&quot;Effective December 19, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p>o Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid
rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. <small>(0.728)</small></p>

offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per

<p>o Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve&#39;s holdings of

calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury
securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities
outstanding. <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p>o Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for
operational reasons. <small>(0.756)</small></p>
<p>o Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate
