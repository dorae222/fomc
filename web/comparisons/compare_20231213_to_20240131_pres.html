Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
January 31, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased
from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path
forward is uncertain.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past two years, we’ve significantly tightened the stance
of monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory,
and we’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As labor market tightness
has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and
inflation goals are moving into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will have more to say about monetary policy—
about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high
mortgage rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed
investment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 1 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a
pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The unemployment rate remains low
at 3.7 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of
workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic
levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The lower inflation
readings over the second half of last year are welcome.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But we will need to see continuing
evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Longer-
term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of
surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and
we’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Our restrictive stance of
Page 2 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the
economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy
restraint at some point this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since
the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The
economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re prepared
to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We know that
reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve
seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>At
the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic
activity and employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the
balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target
range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-run—longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 3 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I look forward to our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’t
want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming—coming down
fully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I wonder—what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And as you
make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data
against the sort of solid inflation progress you’ve been seeing?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Sorry—say that last part again.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>How are—how are you weighing the growth data and
consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let
me say that we have confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is
moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been
increasing, but we want to get greater confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What do we want to see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to see
more good data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not that we’re looking for better data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—we’re looking at continuation
of the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have six months
of good inflation data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it
sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent
inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the answer will come from some more data that’s also good
Page 4 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t—it’s not that the six-month data isn’t—isn’t low enough.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s just a
question of, can we take that with confidence that we’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s really what we’re thinking about.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve
had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth
quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in
economic activity—that hasn’t been the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger
growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t look at it as a problem.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We want to see a strong labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not looking for a weaker labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re
looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six
months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could just follow up very quickly, the—when,
when you say that you want to make sure that it’s a true signal, is there anything that you’re
seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it’s a true signal at this stage?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>No, I think it’s—I, I would say it, it seems—it seems to be the likely
case that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven’t yet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so—I mean, it’s a good story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have six months of good inflation [readings].</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But you
can—and you know this—you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it’s
been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly
negative.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably
approximate zero.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, in
other words, what we care about is the aggregate number—not so much the composition.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But
Page 5 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we, we just need to see more.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s where we are, as a Committee.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We need to see more
evidence that sort of confirms what we think we’re seeing and that tells us that we are on—gives
us confidence that we’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, it seems to
me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>One was the risk of a wage–
price spiral.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This
morning’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private-sector payroll growth running at a
sub–4 percent pace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation
emergency of the last three years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, given that you appear to have substantially cut off these
two tail risks and that you’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory,
what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are you really going to learn
more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does
believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for—partly for the reasons that you say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Growth has been strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor
market is strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really
confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of
dialing back the restrictive level.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, overall, I think—I think people do believe—and, as you
know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But I think to get to that place
where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in
fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 6 of 27

NICK TIMIRAOS.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If I could ask differently: If, if you hold rates high as inflation
moderates, as it—as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its
variants.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by
those rules in the current instance?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor
rules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We consult them regularly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re in our, our
Tealbook, and, and they’re in all the materials that we look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, I don’t think
we’ve ever been at a—at a place where we were—where we were setting policy by them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
there—depending on the rule, it will tell you different things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are many different
formulations.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates
go up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that doesn’t mean we can
mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It doesn’t mean that
at all, because, for one thing, we, we don’t know—we, we look at more than just the fed funds
rate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We look at—broadly—financial conditions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, in addition, we don’t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is
at any given time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that also doesn’t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the
economy turn down, because that would be too late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re really in a risk-management
mode: of managing the risk—as I mentioned in my opening remarks—managing the risk that we
move too soon and move too late.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And I think to move, which is—which is where almost
everyone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of
that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 7 of 27

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks, Chair Powell.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I’d like you to, to key in on the
use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “remains elevated.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’ve pledged to cut
rates before inflation reached 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that implies that there’s some sort of intermediate
step here on, on inflation and that a, a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement
language that inflation “remains elevated.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What’s the step-down from there?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yeah, I, I don’t know that we’ve worked out the particulars—
statement language and that kind of thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at
where, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent,
for example—12-month—which is way down from where it was.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Very, very positive
development—very fast decline—and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue
to come down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, so that’s where—that’s where it is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re, you know, we’re wanting to
see, you know, more data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows
that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’t mention the
other side of the mandate—a slide in employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Would a slide in employment also bring you
to the point of, of cutting rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So let me say that we’re not looking for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s not
something we’re looking for.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, yes, if you think about, you know—in, in the base case, the
economy is performing well—the labor market remains strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>If we saw an unexpected
weakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Absolutely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things—would
argue for moving later.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we
have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth—we have a strong labor market—we
Page 8 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have inflation coming down—that’s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And in that case, what we’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage
of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just to circle back to the “greater
confidence” aspect of the statement, there’s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m just
wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is there unanimity
or, at least, consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater
confidence is?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you
know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence
to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “greater confidence”
threshold could be reached?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re not—we’re not really at that stage.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, we’re—
we’re—there was no proposal to cut rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Some people did, you know, talk about their view of
the rate path.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence
of where people are, although it is—it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So, you know,
we’re not—we’re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we
weren’t actively considering, you know, a—moving, moving the federal funds rate down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I will
say, there is a—there is a wide disparity—a healthy disparity—of views, and you see that in
public, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they’re released every five
years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that’s actually essential for making
good policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other—
Page 9 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we, we compromise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’re able to—for the
most part—able to join in.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>To me, that’s a well-functioning public institution.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rachel.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, over the past few years, there have been all these real-time
indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like
OpenTable data or office attendance.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve talked about vacancies in the past.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I’m
wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that’s giving you the
clearest picture of the economy—including on rents—if you could touch on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Including?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Rent costs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, so we’re not—you know, it’s not the pandemic, so we
can actually rely on more, more traditional forms.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>People are working.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They’re getting wages,
and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I
wouldn’t say we’re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you
point to rents.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Which
would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So
the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as
measured, measured in PCE inflation?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s just a question of when and,
and how big it’ll be.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that will—that
will help.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of
disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some
Page 10 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
more time to run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, these—the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they
were.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, it takes time for the, the healing process to get into prices.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there may be
still a tailwind.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll find out with, with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we look at the things that relate to our
mandate very carefully, and—as you would imagine.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess, just as a quick follow-up—do you feel comfortable at this
point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more
confidence?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I, I think
we have—we have a ways to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above
target on a 12-month basis.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Twelve months is our, our target, certainly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m encouraged, and
we’re encouraged by the progress.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring
victory at all at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We think we have a ways to go.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’ve said that you would know the
neutral rate by its works.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I’m wondering what you could tell me—how do you believe the
neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In other words, how
much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And how much
restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s—I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the
economy—you do see, for example, housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You see the effects.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your, your second
question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through—a lot of
the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor
market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So you’ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other
Page 11 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
cycles and has brought that working with tighter, tighter policy, which has enabled the supply
side to recover—I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, no—we
really do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would point to the
interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s a—it’s a joint
story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s a complicated story.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the
economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s—so I think it’s, it’s—of course, you know that it’s not something
you can identify with any precision.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But if you—a standard approach would be to take the
nominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If
you do that—and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like
to do.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream
estimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but at the same time, you look at
the economy, and you say, “This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, and you
say, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate?”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>What’s happening, though, is, the supply
side has been recovering in the middle of this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that won’t go on forever.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So a lot of the
growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and
demand.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and
supply chains healing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you
know, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>RICH MILLER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you—sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You mentioned earlier we’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you
Page 12 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
talk a little bit more about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote,
unquote, “normal” and that the—we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming
back down to what they were pre-pandemic?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Even with today’s ECI levels, they were still above
those pre-pandemic levels.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing
normal—but not totally back to normal.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you pointed to one or more of them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I think,
you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Wages—wage increases, rather,
are not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I, I would
look at it this way, though.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that process will probably take some time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So wage setting is something that happens—it’s,
it’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And that’s okay.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s okay.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that
wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving
back to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are
more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one—
and, and, you know, I think we’re, we’re moving in the right direction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market,
basically, you’re saying?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s
rebalancing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Clearly, that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers
and supply at the beginning of the pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we lost several million workers at the
beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then when the
economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just—it
Page 13 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was everywhere—panic on the part of businesses—couldn’t, couldn’t find people.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So, what’s
happened is—we expected labor—the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it
didn’t.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well,
maybe we won’t get it back.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then 2023, we did, as you know—so labor force participation
came back strongly in ’23, and so did immigration.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Immigration came to a halt during the
pandemic.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor
market to what is still a very strong labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s still a good labor market for wages and for
finding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And, you know,
one great way to look at that is what’s happening with, with wage increases.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you see it now
across the, the major things that we—that we track.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a
clear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with
where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chris.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I
wanted to follow up on Rich’s question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It sounded like you suggested that you’re not worried
about faster growth so much—so wanted to see if you’re seeing anything that suggests that
inflation could reaccelerate from here.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And it sounds like you’re saying you’re not worried that
solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would
reaccelerate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think the, the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level
meaningfully above 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s, to me, more likely.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, if—if inflation were
to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that, and that would—
Page 14 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that would be a surprise at this point.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But I have to tell you, that’s why we keep our options open
here and why we’re not, you know, rushing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I think both of those are risks, but I think the
more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you’ve had six good months—very good
months—but what, what’s really going to “shake out” here?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, where—what will—
when we look back, what will we see?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Are the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat
themselves?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t think so.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We don’t—you know, that’s not what we think, but that’s the
question we are asking.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And just one quick follow-up—Governor Waller had
mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is that something
you’re watching as well?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And if, if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you
more confidence where things are going?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll just have to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ll—we look at those.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Last year
was a—was a, a surprise.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>If you don’t
want to use the term “soft landing,” would you say, at least, that, from your point of view now,
the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risks have
diminished very much?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And you mentioned below–2 percent inflation for—on a three-month
basis, core PCE has been running at 1½ percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And there are those on Wall Street who think
that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation
running below your target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How do you see that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 15 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, how to—your first question—how to describe where we are?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So
I guess I would just say this—executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over
the course of last year.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market—3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor
market is strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’ve had just about two years now of, of unemployment under 4 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That hasn’t happened in 50 years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So it’s a good labor market.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And we’ve seen inflation come
down.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve talked about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an
expectation that there’s more to come.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is a—this is a good situation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s be honest.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>This is a—this is a good economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But what’s the outlook?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>That’s looking in the rearview—the outlook—we do expect
growth to moderate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’t happened, but
we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its
course.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The labor market is rebalancing, as, as I mentioned.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Job creation has slowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The base
of job growth has narrowed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, of course, 12-month inflation is, is above target and getting,
you know, getting down closer to target.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on
track for that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those are the risks and, and questions we have to answer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, overall, this is a
pretty good picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It, it is a good picture.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Your second question was—sorry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Could you get inflation that is below target—end up with inflation
below target, and you have to do something about that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the
2 percent base once.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And the same
thing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s
annualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We’re not—you know, we’re not
looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 16 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So if we do face those circumstances, then we’ll have to deal with that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think—I think as of
now, you know, the, the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish
the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you,
Mr. Chairman, for taking this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, as I’ve—as I’ve heard from some District Fed presidents, is
it, in your view, a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then
when we do see that first rate cut, is that—should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate-cut
cycle, or is it a one-off?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I’ll point you to that language on your first question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We, we
included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor
market, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when
to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So if you take that to the current
context—current context, we’re going to be data dependent.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be looking at this
meeting by meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely
that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify
March as the time to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But that’s, that’s to be seen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wouldn’t call—you know, when
you say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I would say I
don’t think that’s—that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base
case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And your second question is—
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On, on the—is this the start of a—when we see a cut, is it the
start of a cutting cycle, or is it—could it just be a one-off?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 17 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, that’s going to depend on the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>The whole thing is,
this is going to depend on the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects
the outlook and the balance of risks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re going to make our decisions based on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
it could wind up—you know, we’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting, and, and
people will write down what they think.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, in the end, it’s really going to depend on how the
economy evolves.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower—for
example, stronger inflation—more, more persistent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There are risks that would cause us
to—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or—and sooner.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And that would be a
weakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those
are the kinds of things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re just—we’re just going to be reacting to the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s the—
that’s really the only way we can do this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Could you talk a little bit more
about productivity growth?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know, you’ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the
level of wage growth that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’ve obviously seen, you
know—you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it’s cooled a little bit but still sort of
above what you wanted to see.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth has been very strong.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>How much of those numbers do
you attribute to productivity?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because
of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about—or do you think that
productivity growth will, will fade over time?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So this is a really interesting question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I think—my, my own
view is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as
workers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then you saw a deep trough
Page 18 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of productivity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And then, over the last—you saw high productivity last year, in ’23.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think
we’re, we’re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And the question
will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on,
you know, fundamental aspects of our economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Is there—is there a case—will it be the case
that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t know.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What would it take?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is
that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work
from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or AI, artificial intelligence—
generative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So
I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say
that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and
out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So would that be behind why we’ve seen such strong
growth, but we’ve also seen inflation fall—that maybe there’s just a higher level of productivity?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s one way to look at it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I want to ask a little bit more about housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>I’m wondering—how closely are you
watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And it seems
like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So when we think about, you know—our, our statutory goals are
maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re targeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re not targeting
housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Those are very important
Page 19 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
things for people’s lives.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But they’re not—you know, those are not the things we’re targeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the
housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And when we raise rates,
the housing industry can be hurt, because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You know,
we have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And these are not—these are not things that
we have any tools to address.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our
work is inflation, which is a combination.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>It’s, it’s really rental inflation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re taking owners’
equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And you’re, you’re running that through the
CPI calculation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And what that’s telling
you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will
show up in inflation over time.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It has to as long as that remains the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And just real quick—what is your response to the
letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to
make housing more affordable?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job—the
job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>Price stability is
absolutely essential for people’s lives, most importantly for—well, not most importantly—most,
mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the
margins.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so someone—for someone like that, high inflation in the—in the necessities of
life—right away, you’re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know,
some scope to absorb higher costs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we have to get—it’s our job.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s what society has asked
Page 20 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
us to do, is to get inflation down, and the tools that we use to do it are interest rates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Can you give us some insight
into whether the Committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the
months ahead?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has
gone very well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And as the process has continued, you know, we’re getting to that time where
questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So at
this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we’re planning to begin in-
depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So those, those
questions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But we’re, we’re at the
beginning of that process, I would say.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Quick follow-up—is it the case that the Fed would decide to
lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so they
don’t—for example, if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but
continuing to run off the balance sheet.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In both cases, that’s normalization, but from a strict
monetary policy standpoint, you could say we’re loosening along with tightening.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So that, that
could happen.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about, but right now, we’re
thinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ll—we’ll be looking into that as a Committee
starting in March.</strong></em></p>

<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build
up confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’t
start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Roughly how many months do you think you might need of, of good inflation data to be—to be
confident?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m just going to

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We, we have growing confidence, but not
to the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the
process of, of dialing back on restriction.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we want to get that right, and we feel like the
strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We think that’s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we’ve made a lot

<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Chair Powell, I want to change
gears a little bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In the presidential primary campaign that’s been going on for the last nine
months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates had said that they
probably wouldn’t want to give you a third term.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about
that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Do you want another term—you’ve had—on the Fed?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>What, what’s your stance on that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I don’t have a stance on that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s not something I’m focused on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>[We’re] focused on doing our jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We have—this year is going to be a highly consequential
year for, for the Fed and for monetary policy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’re, all of us, very buckled down, focused
on doing our jobs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jennifer.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over
the past six months.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year, at 2.4
percent, compared to that six-month measure.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Given that forecast and that the median is for
three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it’s been over the last six months
for the next six months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 23 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I—you know, we’re going to do—we’ll update our, our inflation
forecasts at the next meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You referred to the December meeting.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That’s, that’s, you know,
three months old [by March], so it might be lower now, given the data we’ve gotten.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So, look, as
I mentioned, we’re going to be reacting to the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If, if we get—if we get very strong inflation
data and it, it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we’ll go slower or later or both.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>If we got really
good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the—that, that would tell us that, that we
could go sooner and perhaps go faster.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we’re just going to be—but, of course, we’ll weigh
that with all the other factors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>We’re setting policy based on the totality of, of the data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But just to follow—if inflation stays where it is currently,
that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Would that mean
you’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Well, I think if we—if we came to the view that, that inflation
were—that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in “PCE
world”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be, then,
yes, our policy would be in a different place.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It would.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>But, you know, that’s the whole point is,
we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a
sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.</strong></em></p>

if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It seems to suggest that
consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I just
wonder—is it fair to say that they’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in

recent months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has
played a role in that?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And what challenges do you see, going forward?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys
have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a
couple of years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And we’ve asked ourselves why
that is.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on
this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>So prices went up much more
than 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And people are going to the store, and
they’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they’re not happy about it.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>And it’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price—the
prices they’re paying are still high.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that, that is what—that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And
they’re, they’re right to be unhappy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>You know, this is why we need to keep price stability.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s
why we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In terms of [surveys]—you’re right.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of—you’ve
seen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the
economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I guess that’s a good thing.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That can—that can support spending—can support
economic activity.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>There’s some evidence of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you
know, a meaningful increase.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve
been at various times.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But it’s—they certainly have come up.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Bryan.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>BRYAN MENA.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you for taking our questions.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Bryan Mena, CNN Business.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Committee members have said they’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in

person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large
revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the
economy being quarterly.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So did any members say they’ve learned anything not reflected in the
data?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’t been
captured in the data yet?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Well, yes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So we, we do meet
with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And I always feel like
you—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual
companies—individual management teams—and then building out from that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so, starting
with GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>It’s very hard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So I, I really like anecdotal data.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks
have really the best network of anyone.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>In all their Districts, they’re talking to, you know, not
just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit
community.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>They have arms into all of that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And so when they come back—that’s what goes
into the Beige Book.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during
the outlook go-around, they’ll say, “In my District . . .”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And they’ll talk about 100 conversations
they—not—they won’t talk—they, they will give you input, based on 100 conversations that
they’ve had with people of all different walks.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And it’s—I personally find it very helpful in
understanding what’s going on.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the
data sometimes.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Did any of them—did any of them notice slowing economy based on
what they’ve heard from, like, their District?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Page 26 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I mean, if you—if you look back at the last—not this Beige
Book, but the one before, it was more—there was a lot of “slower activity.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I think that, that
what you’re hearing now is, is, things are picking up a bit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>You’re hearing—not, not in every
District and not every, every person that we talk to, but you’re—overall, it feels like you’re
hearing things picking up at the margin.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>So that’s what comes through.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>JEFF COX.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Just kind of looking to put it all
together: You talked about basically the, the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent
annualized growth in the fourth quarter.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to
you now than any inflation threat might?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>That, you know—you’re in a position, in other words,
to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’re more—you’re more tilted
towards that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too
strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>I’m not so worried about that.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>You know, it’s—again, we’ve had
inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in
unemployment, and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if
it’s going to continue.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>So I, I am—you know, I think—I think declining inflation—continued
declines in inflation are, are really the main thing we’re looking at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Of course, we want the labor
market to remain strong, too.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added dovish"><em><strong>We don’t have a growth mandate.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added neutral"><em><strong>We’ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a,
a price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Growth only matters to the
extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.</strong></em></p>
<p class="added hawkish"><em><strong>Thank you very much.</strong></em></p>

Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 13, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been
made toward our dual-mandate objectives.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come
without a significant increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>But inflation is still too
high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As
we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Our actions have moved our policy rate well into
restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity
and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that
we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will make decisions about the extent of any
additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from
the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Even so, GDP is on track to expand around
Page 1 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving
supply conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>After picking somewhat over the—up somewhat over the summer, activity in
the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business
fixed investment.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants
revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median
projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the
supply of workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly
for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Although
the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available
workers.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing
upward pressures on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises
somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose
2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and
energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 2 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need
to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our
goal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a
broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from
financial markets.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation
all the way to 2 percent will take some time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent
this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Our restrictive
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle,
the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing
progress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re committed to achieving a stance of
Page 3 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a path to that
objective.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to
raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and
2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve
as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is
proceeding carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In determining the extent of any additional policy
firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will
take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary
policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-
term inflation expectations well anchored.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage
for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</del></p>

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I look forward to your questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Chris Rugaber.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted
to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “any” before “additional . . .</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>firming” in
the statement?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I mean, does that mean that you’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the
Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the
extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy
firming”—that sentence.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe
that we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Participants didn’t write down
additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But participants also
didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s really what we were
thinking.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Fed
Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several
months could be cutting interest rates.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree
with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn’t cut
rates if inflation fell.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 5 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, of course, I don’t comment on, on any other officials, even those
who work at the Fed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But I’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the way—
the way we’re looking at it is, is really this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>When we started out, right, we said the first question
is, how fast to move, and we moved very fast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The second question is, you know, really, how
high to raise the policy rate?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And that’s really the question that we’re still on here.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We’re, we’re
very focused on that, as I—as I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>People generally think that we’re at or near that and,
and think it’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’t take that possibility off the table.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s—when you get to that question, and that’s your answer, there’s a natural—naturally, it
begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back
the amount of policy restraint that’s in place.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s really the next question, and that’s what people are thinking about and, and
talking about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And I would just say this.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that
appears to be moderating; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so
many measures; and we’re seeing inflation making real progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>These are the things we’ve
been wanting to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We can’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We still have a ways to go.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No one is declaring victory.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That would be premature.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we can’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re,
we’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
that’s, that’s really the question that we’re on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, of course, the other question, the question of
when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place,
that, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion—topic of discussion out in the
world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 6 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it, it comes up in this way today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Everybody wrote down
an SEP forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So many people mentioned what their—what their rate forecast was.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there
was no back-and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like, “This is what I wrote down;
this is what I think,” that kind of thing, and a preliminary kind of a discussion like that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Not
everybody did that, but many people did.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And then, and I would say, there’s a general
expectation that this will be—this will be a topic for us, looking ahead.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That, that’s really what
happened in today’s meeting.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I can’t do the head count for you in real time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s generally
what happened today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Rachel.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a
recession and isn’t heading for one now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And if the answer is “no,” I’m curious about what
you’d still be looking for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the
economy is in a recession now.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I would say that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next
year, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s always a
real possibility.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I have always felt, since the
beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could
cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that
have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So far, that’s what we’re
seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>This result is not
Page 7 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
guaranteed.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It is—it is far too early to declare victory.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And there are certainly risks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s
certainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has done that
repeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, where we are is, is we
see the things that I—that I mentioned.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious, if you’re looking back on the past year, you talked
about “navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Can you talk about some of the ways in
which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way
and had to pivot to respond?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very
broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And not only did that not happen—that
includes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of
forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually
had a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on
the supply side.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked
up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages
and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we had significant supply-side gains with
strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth
year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just
because of the healing on the supply side.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that was a surprise to just about everybody.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but
in a very different setting.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has
also been significantly better.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a
Page 8 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
significant increase in, in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It didn’t really happen.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re still at 3.7 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So
we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that’s coming back into
balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s a—you
know, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for
taking the questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what—on what
motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’s a coincidence, for example, that the spread
between PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you’re expecting, in
the rate of inflation that you’re expecting as opposed to supporting the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nothing quite that mechanical is happening.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The SEP really is, is a
bottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think people are looking at what’s happening
in the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is
that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know,
really significantly in three months.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s a big piece of, of this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At the same time, [real GDP]
growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter. [</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Now it] is slowing, we believe, as,
as appropriate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again,
significant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re
seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But so I think that
people look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast
and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We tabulate them and, and publish it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so it’s
not—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 9 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, that’s—that is—that is something that we’re very
conscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we
think about things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, as you well
know, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how
tight policy is at any given time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you
would get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And,
indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is
declining as we—as we move forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has, has
already kind of begun.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m wondering, just related to, to Steve’s question, how the—how the
tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into
2024, the closer you get to a presidential election.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you want to front-load this, in other
words?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
don’t think about politics.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The
minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We have to think,
what’s the right thing?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time
we—when we think is the right time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’ll always do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I mentioned we’re moving carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>One of the things we’re moving carefully about
is that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough,
really.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s us thinking that
we have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to
Page 10 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Nonetheless, it’s not the base case anymore,
obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s, that’s how we’re—that’s how we’re
approaching things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks
about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start
to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having
going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time
goes forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Chair Powell, you’ve
argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the
market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The market is now easing policy
on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that’s a full point below the
current level, with cuts beginning around March.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is this something that you are broadly
comfortable with?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw
thing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and
moving back and that kind of thing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what
we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really
focus on.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going
to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in any case,
we have to do what we think is right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned
or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course,
Page 11 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
because we will do what it takes to get to our goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, ultimately, that will mean that
financial conditions will, will come along.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But in the meantime, there can be back-and-forth,
and, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And my colleagues are
focused on that, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Do
you believe we’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Listen, I welcome the progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think it’s, it’s really good to see the
progress that we’re making.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures,
you see very low numbers.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That isn’t to say—
I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s great.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just need to see more.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
need to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s what we need to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And that—it’s one of our two
jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re very focused on, on, you
know, doing that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re pleased with the
progress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is
a lot of uncertainty about going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ve seen the economy move in surprising
directions, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If
growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than
Page 12 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Or, put another way, is below-trend
growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Growth is one thing,
so is inflation, so is labor market data.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’d, we’d look at the totality.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>As we—as we make
decisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and,
particularly, about the—as they affect the outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and
the balance of risks as well.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’ll be good for the
labor market.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to
2 percent.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we
will set policy according to what we actually see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, and so that’s how I would answer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I guess the—I guess the question I’m asking, if you don’t mind a
quick follow-up, I guess the question I’m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s only a
problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, you know, if you
have—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor
market very strong.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>That could
mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That could mean we need to keep rates
higher for longer.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It just is—
it’s the way, the way our policy works.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Neil.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>NEIL IRWIN.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Neil Irwin with Axios.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How do you interpret the state
of the labor market right now?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in particular, you’ve referred even today to evidence that
Page 13 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it’s coming into better balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that
balance?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>It’s—
you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given
population growth and labor force participation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The things that are not quite—but let me go on
with that list.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, claims are low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re—
sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and
they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If you look at shortages of
workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to
it, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation,
unemployment—so many measures: the unemployment—job openings, quits, all of those
things.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation
over a long period of time.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>They’ve been gradually cooling off.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if wages are running around
4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And I guess there, there are just a couple of
other—the unemployment rate is very, very low.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And these are—but, but I would just say,
overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s been a good time for
workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, I’d say the mood among
economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat
corroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a soft landing.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Yet when
Page 14 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we—when we hear from the general public, there’s a lot of discord about economic conditions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It may be.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down,
and that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Prices of some, some goods and
services are coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So people are
still living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And,
you know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now
positive.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And so that might help improve the mood of people.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>The thing that we can do is
to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits
over such long periods of time, and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and
achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families
and, and companies around the country.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I wanted to ask, you know, on,
on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start
to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we’re seeing now, how would you
all think about that in terms of rate cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Would that be a sign that you’ve, you’ve done your job
demand-wise?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry—if?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If, if the economy starts to—looks like it’s starting to fall into a
recession; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 15 of 24

CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s not something we’re hoping to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Obviously, we’re hoping
to, to see something very different—which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the
labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment,
inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating
without a significant increase in unemployment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s what we’re, we’re trying very much to
achieve and not something that we’re looking to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of
the data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in
that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the
beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on
that decision.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Mr.
Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight
inflation, and you said earlier, again, “the full effects of our tightening (cycle) have not yet been
felt.”</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’re not behind the
curve there?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And
we do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of
overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on
the price-stability mandate.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do
Page 16 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you’re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates—you’re getting now
back to the point where both mandates are important, and they’re, they’re more in balance, too.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>You know, we’re, we’re
obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We see the same
thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in
2023.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next
year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And you see what the forecasts are.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think the median growth—median participant wrote
down 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It’s very hard to predict.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>We’ll also
be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but
ideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If I could follow up: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be
essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and
error, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really
specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used
in, I guess, 2013.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really
worked out yet.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Edward Lawrence of Fox
Business.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is, is showing, about 75 basis points, does that
signal that there’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 17 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It wouldn’t, if that were to—first of all, let me just say, that isn’t a
plan.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s not something—you
know this, but allow me to say it again: We don’t debate or discuss what the right, you know,
whose SEP is right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So and
it’s, you know, it’s important for people to know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But it wouldn’t need to be a sign of—it
could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn’t need the tight policy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It
depends on—the economy can evolve in many different ways, right?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So but, but it could be
more of what I just described.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And you focused on core inflation, we’ve heard from—in
other meetings.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>How sticky is core inflation right now?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve
seen real progress in, in core inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is
thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which
was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We are seeing some progress
there, though.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing:
goods, housing services, nonhousing services.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They’re all contributing in different—at different
levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So, yeah.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Catarina.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>CATARINA SARAIVA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this,
you know, this morning and yesterday.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the
forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking,
you know, on the inflation outlook.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 18 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we got—we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we
got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s
very late in the game, you know, to—but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to
update their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>After that, so staff has to—has to
cumulate all of that and create the documents that you see.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So until about midmorning, a little,
maybe late morning, it’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast
based on what we saw today.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And do you see—I mean, how are you, when you think
about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do
you, you know, how do you think about the economy we’re in now kind of post-pandemic?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do
you think that there’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look
at a rate cut path?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question of whether there have been fundamental structural
shifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>The one that
would affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate
of interest is.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to
have risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey
the same level of restriction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The thing is, we’re not really going to know that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know,
people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s just
that it’s going to be uncertain.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really
unprecedented environment.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the
natural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy
Page 19 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
operates with a lag.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So that’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>We started
slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There’s—
you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it
doesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Maybe people just bought so
much stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>They haven’t got anyplace to put it.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>[Laughter]
MICHELLE SMITH.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Jennifer.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to
2 percent inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>On a six-
month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and
shelter, they are, of course, stickier.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So when looking in the different components of the data,
how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates
is that policy would be, it would be too late.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the
economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,
if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, it takes—it
takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I can’t give you a precise answer.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you
know, I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would
take.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 20 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to identify any one precise
point, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be
right.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But we’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Let’s go to Jean Yung.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>JEAN YUNG.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Jean Yung with Market News.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I wanted to go back to
the stickiness-of-inflation question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have
talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it’s also
been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I’m curious, do you think something
has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Or is it
something different about the U.S. economy?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think—I think this.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we felt since the beginning that it
would be a combination of two factors.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what
happened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And the second thing would
be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the
supply side to recover because of lower demand.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We thought those two things were going to be
necessary.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>If there was something different about the U.S. economy.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the
U.S. economy being different.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload,
pot-boiling-over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It was a combination of very
strong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but
Page 21 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So this is just very
unusual.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And, you know, we had the view—my colleagues and I broadly had the view—that we
could get a lot of—you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve, because you ran into
the limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren’t workers and because people
couldn’t—the supply chains were all broken.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>So we, we had the view that you could come
straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you
know, something like that has happened.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It happened so far.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The question is, you know, once,
once that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort
of supply chain and shortages side has some, some ways to run—does labor force participation
have much more to run?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>It might.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>Immigration could help, but it may be that, at some point—at
some point, you will run out of supply-side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets
harder.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s, that’s very possible.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be
different, I’d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We
just don’t know.</del></p>
<p class="removed dovish"><del>I mean, inflation keeps coming down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The labor market keeps getting back
into balance.</del></p>
<p class="removed neutral"><del>And it’s so far, so good—although we kind of assume that it will get harder from
here.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>But so far, it hasn’t.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’ll go to Megan for the last question.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>MEGAN CASSELLA.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks for taking our questions.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’s focus now on
proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And can you talk us through what the latest
thinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening
at all?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Page 22 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now,
just to get that out of the way.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>What we’ve been
seeing is, you know, that we’re allowing runoff each month.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s adding up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>I think we’re
down—we’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>That’s showing up.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>The reverse repo facility [take-
up] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or—as a result—or
holding steady.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>At a certain point, you know, there won’t be any more to come out of, or there’ll
be a level where [take-up at] the reverse repo facility levels out.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, at that point, reserves will
start to come down.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, we still have—you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until
we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that
consistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the
balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with
ample reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion
[dollars].</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re not—we don’t think we’re at those [levels judged consistent with ample]
reserves.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>There isn’t a lot of evidence of that.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>We’re watching it carefully.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And, you know, so
far—so far, it’s working pretty much as expected, we think.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time
you’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Is that time to rethink, or are you
still going to follow that thinking?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You’re asking,
though, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such
time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight?</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>And the answer is,
Page 23 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it depends on the reason.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>You know, if you’re—if you’re—if you’re cutting rates because you’re
going back to normal, that’s one thing, [and distinct from] if you’re cutting them because the
economy is really weak.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>So you can imagine, you’d have to know what the reason is to know
whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.</del></p>
<p class="removed hawkish"><del>Thanks very much.</del></p>
