Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 7, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state and remains solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent
as of September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting
maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint
by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We continue to be confident that,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor
market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We also
decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more to say about monetary
policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the
second quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in
equipment and intangibles has strengthened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been
weak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.
economy over the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This figure would have
been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment
Page 1 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
in October.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families,
businesses, and communities who have been harm—harmed by these devastating storms.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over
the past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has
eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, a broad set of
indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the
pandemic in 2019.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Total PCE prices rose
2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we’re attentive to the risks to
both sides of our mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range
for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This further
recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor
market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more
neutral stance over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know that reducing policy strain—restraint too quickly could hinder progress on
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic
Page 2 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
activity and employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and
the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are not on any preset course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy remains strong and inflation is
not sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the
labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than
anticipated, we can move more quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and
uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that our
affect—actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to our discussion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given the expectation that the election outcome will
produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the
Committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the
next one in December?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive
the Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next Administration?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 3 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no
effects on our policy decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and
anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to
forecast, looking out past the very near term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Here, we don’t know what the timing and
substance of any policy changes will be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We therefore don’t know what the effects on the
economy would be—specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the
achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t—we
don’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, just in principle, it’s possible that
any Administration’s policies or, or policies put in place by Congress could have economic
effects over time—over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So,
we—along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in
our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Roughly
one year ago when the 10-year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30-year mortgage rates
were near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh
on economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Given that you’ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now
dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today
any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above
your target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would just say this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve watched the, the run-up in bond
rates, and it’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess that, you know, the long-
Page 4 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
run rates are well below that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re watching that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Things have been moving around,
and we’ll see where they settle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s too early to really say where they settle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Ultimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I
certainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I will say,
though, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way
of downside risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what they’re about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we do take financial conditions into account.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If they—if they’re persistent
and if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I would say
we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just something that we’re watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
again, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other
factors in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up—is the September SEP—are those rate
projections still valid?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know what?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between
the last set and the next set.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The NIPA
revision was stronger.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October
report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of,
of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the
NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I
think we would factor that in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
At the same time, we got one inflation report, which was—it wasn’t terrible, but it was—
it was a little higher than expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, really, the question is, is December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you
know, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report,
two more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we
get to December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically
as you try to make that decision?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then, as of the Fed’s economic projections in September,
you, you had written down four quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you still think that
those are likely?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if it
shifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of, of detail as to why?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I can’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,
and I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I can’t really speak for kind of
exactly where the—where the Committee is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would just say, for December, we’re going to
be—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that
affects the outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at
5.33 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re, we’re asking
ourselves, “Is that where we need to be?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between
the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too
slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re trying to, to be on a middle
path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress
Page 6 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think that’s where we are, but that’s the question we’re going to be asking in
September and, and in other meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, I can’t really update you on the Committee’s
thinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yes, total—totally appreciate that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess when it comes to your
own thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a
reasonable outlook?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, I’m going to wait—we’re going to wait and see how things
come in in December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I—it’s just—I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more
neutral stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and that’s very much what we’re on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That has not changed at all since
September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Obviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say
that, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know,
where the Committee would be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wondered if you
could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement
here in the first paragraph when you say, “Inflation has made progress,” dropping the word
“further progress,” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had
“gained greater confidence” that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there
any policy substance behind either of those changes in language?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it—is it meant to open the
door to a December pause?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core
inflation in the last three months?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 7 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not really, no.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me tell you what we were thinking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the test
of gaining further confidence was a—was our test for the first rate cut, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we, we met
that test in September, and therefore we take that test out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you leave it in, then it’s new
forward guidance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s brand new forward guidance. “</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What do you mean by it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you—are
you making—are you requiring yet further guidance?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to say “yes” or “no” at every
meeting whether we’ve made further progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The point is we have gained confidence that, that we’re on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, I would tell you, is, is what that’s really all about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s not meant to send
a signal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neither of those is meant to send a further signal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, saying “further
progress” it becomes a test where we don’t want to be—we don’t think it’s a good time to be
doing a lot of, of forward guidance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re—there’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that—in what I’ve said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
path that we’re on, we do know what—where the destination is, but we don’t know the right
pace, and we don’t know exactly where the destination is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the—the—the point is to find that,
to find the right pace and the right destination as we go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think there’s a fair amount of
uncertainty about that, and, you know, you don’t want to tie yourself up with, with guidance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher
rates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You didn’t talk about it in terms of
expectations of higher deficits.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in
interest rates, and is that—are rising deficits a concern to you?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 8 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we don’t comment on fiscal policy, and, again, I don’t have a lot
more to say on, on what’s driving bond yields.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of, of policy changes, though, let me
give you a sense of how this, this works in the ordinary case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s say Congress is considering a
rewrite of the tax laws; it doesn’t matter what’s in the content.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we would follow that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At a
certain point, we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we’d start to model it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then we’d wait,
and we’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “This
is—these are the likely effects.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy
changes on various parts of the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’d, we’d try to get smart on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then the
law actually passes, and, you know, you’d start to put it—you’d probably run an alternative
simulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then, then when it
actually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, these—we have a very large economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many things are affecting it at any
given time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but—it would go in,
but it would—you know, it’s a process that takes some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Clearly, the legislative process
takes a lot of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, the real question is not the effect of that law.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s all of the
policy changes that are happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the
economy at any given time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that
we go through all the time with every Administration, constantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I just—this will be no
different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, right now, we’re—there’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right
now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s such an early stage.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know what the policies are, and once we know what
they are, we won’t—we won’t have a sense of, you know, when they’ll be implemented or, or all
those sorts of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think I would just say—
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mm-hmm.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 9 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL. —</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>we’re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be
very much regular order when we do do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could just follow up on Nick’s question—are the current rates
something you feel like you need to lean against, in that they go against the direction of policy
by being—adding restriction to the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a
signal that you should do less?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—look, I just think—the first question is, how long will they be
sustained?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you remember the 5 percent 10-year, people were drawing massively important
conclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, it’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that
really matter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t know that about these.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What we’ve seen so far?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re
watching it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re reading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but
right now it’s not a major factor in, in how we’re thinking about things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You
mentioned the positive economic data that we’ve seen since the September meeting, including
the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We saw a stock market jump yesterday.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this—with this
backdrop?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest
economic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But, of
course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with
today’s cut, policy is still restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how
Page 10 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
restrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you look at our goal variables, the labor
market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially
in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further
cooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and
we judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So the job’s not
done on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was
appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision
is really another step in that process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an
appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even
as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to follow up, could you—what might
cause you to pause rate cuts in December?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What kind of economic data would lead you to that
path?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
we’re—so we’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down—our stance down over
time to a more neutral level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to
adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, for
example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more
quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may
turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you—
you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
Page 11 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, you know, it—we’re thinking about it that way, but it’s, it’s something that we’re just
beginning to think about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So with, with this noise in the jobs
reports that we’ve seen and you look at the Fed’s favorite inflation, PCE inflation, overall it’s
2.1 percent—very close to the Fed’s target—but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it’s been that
way since July.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So why doesn’t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting
the 12-month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at all of them, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re
around 2.3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at all of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we expect there to
be bumps.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings
were very, very low—probably unsustainably low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts
generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the other hand, the January
reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
there will literally be a bump up and then down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 12 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say,
“What’s—what is the inflation story now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Where is it coming from?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I point to a couple of
things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that—
of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained
2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So they’re back at that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s not is housing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let’s talk about housing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Housing services is higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s going on there
is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what’s
happening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to
where market, market leases are—market rent leases are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s just a catch-up problem.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s
not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that’s, that’s one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary
pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Where is it coming from?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not a very tight economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is the story about
inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re
seeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent
with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and
settling around 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data
months, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re
this far into the process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So you’re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you
see, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 13 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nothing in the economic data suggests that the Committee has any
need to be in a hurry to get there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We are seeing strong economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are seeing
ongoing strength in the labor market; we’re watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining
strength there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is
carefully, patiently.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, that’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we—to the
extent—to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of
that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Craig.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CRAIG TORRES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Two questions
today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election
results?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and
I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum-employment side of the
mandate, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One of the
broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Compensation
gains are sliding back.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading
down to that bad neighborhood of the 20-teens.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole
saying any “further cooling” is unwelcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is cooling, generally, a little bit further.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So at
what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything
that relates directly or indirectly to the election.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the second one, you’re—you know, this is
the great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll just say a couple things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 14 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, there’s nothing really surprising here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What we know is that the
unemployment rate is low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We also know that it’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up
significantly from a year or so ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sometimes that has meant bad things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So far, it doesn’t appear to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It appears that the—I
wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very
gradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And our policy, of course, is designed to keep
it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further
progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, the, the
openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would—I would characterize it more
broadly as “normalizing.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Wages are still running just a bit above where
they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to
remain at this high level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at
these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So I would say—in fact, you can
say it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given
current productivity readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high
readings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That
has always been the case for 50 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If
you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set
of productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, overall, it’s a good labor
market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We could talk about 20 different data series.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 15 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But, you know, we don’t want the labor market to, to soften much from here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We don’t think we
need that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some of the President-elect’s
advisers have suggested that you should resign.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If he asked you to leave, would you go?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you follow up on is—do you think that legally that you’re not
required to leave?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You talk
a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in terms of
forward-looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials
around the country?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What did you hear today from the regional Bank presidents about what
companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than
looking backwards?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you
think the appropriate policy path should be?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of
discussions we had, and, of course, you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I would
say this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the
CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive,
feeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer
Page 16 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking
about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So they feel like the labor market’s in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People feel good about where the economy is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Demand is obviously pretty strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
you know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Maybe the
year is 2½. This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s actually remarkable how
well the U.S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor
market, inflation coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, you know, really performing better than any of our
global peers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think that is reflected in what you hear from—what I hear people hear from
CEOs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from
those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that, and it’s pretty
constructive overall.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, that’s not to say—there are areas of caution and things like that but,
ultimately, overall pretty positive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on
the horizon that you identified as something you’re watching, what would they be?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks
around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the U.S.
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about
those as, you know, something that’s on the horizon all the time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, ultimately, if
you look at the U.S. economy, its, its performance has been very good.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And that’s, that’s what
we hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If anything, people feel next
year—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year.</div>

ANDREW ACKERMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just
wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Your predecessors Greenspan and
Volcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial—
economic or financial stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Will you do that, too?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, right now, we’re in a period of full
employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have large budget deficits and debt at historic, historic highs that are—and
rising.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that something you’d speak out against?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the
predecessors you mentioned have said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal—federal
government’s fiscal path—fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The level of our debt
relative to the economy is not unsustainable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The path is unsustainable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And,
you know, you’ve got a very large deficit at—you’re at full employment, and that’s expected to
continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So it’s important that we—you know, that that be dealt with.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is ultimately a threat
to the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, I can say that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t have oversight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t have oversight over
fiscal policy.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ANDREW ACKERMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess the only other question is—to
follow up on Victoria’s question—do you believe the President has the power to fire or demote
you, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other
Governors with leadership positions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not permitted under the law.</div>

COURTENAY BROWN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In response
to Howard’s question, you said it wasn’t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the
economic uncertainties.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not
it includes some of the proposals that the President-elect has put out on the campaign trail—
tariffs, for instance?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at
all, nor will I today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I
mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess I should start by saying
that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very
good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And one risk is that
we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes
back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we have to avoid
that risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The other
risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do
unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That, that says, “Don’t
get behind the curve.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so
we’re, we’re in the middle there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage
both of those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor
market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,
enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so there’s—you know, there—
this is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right
path is.</div>

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, it’s not as important—the precise timing of these things is not as important as
the overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of
neutral, a more neutral policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its
works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But as we move further, there will be
more uncertainty about where that is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re going to move carefully as, as this goes on so
that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I know you don’t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look
at the breakevens, it, it is clear that longer-term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at
about 2.5 percent, for example, on the five-year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s up half a point from when you cut in
September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you have any concern at all that longer-term inflation expectations are
deanchoring or, put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we, we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw
longer-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not what we’re seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I
looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s
just—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, overall,
expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with
2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow
inflation expectations to drift upward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in
2022 was, was to avoid that.</div>

MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kelly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KELLY O’GRADY.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kelly O’Grady, CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just talked
about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans
are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what’s your message to them
on when they might expect relief?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So you’re right that, you know, we say that the economy is
performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,
for example.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock, and
inflation went up everywhere.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know, it, it stays with you because the price level
doesn’t come back down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people
to feel better.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think we’re well
on the road to creating that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has come way down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is still strong here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wages are moving up
but, but at a sustainable level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening
and, for the most part, has happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain
their confidence and feel that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about
the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those feelings are true;
they’re accurate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t question them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—you know, we respect them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just a quick follow-up—President-elect Trump has been
critical of your performance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Any concern about his influence on the Fed’s independence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not going—I’m not going to get into the—any of the political
things here today, but thank you.</div>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is your plan if we start to see stagflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so
we don’t have to deal with it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s our—that is actually our plan. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Laughter] You know,
it’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with
interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the
employment mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I would just say that, you know, we’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a
whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in
unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So knock on wood, we’ve
gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And we believe we can
complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is
exactly what we’re trying to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t rule anything out or in that far away.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s
certainly not, not our plan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I mean, our baseline expectation is that we’ll continue to move
gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and
that the labor market will remain strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at our—look at our—that will not change
from the September SEP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, that is our baseline forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, short of some
exogenous event, it will—that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—
but, ultimately, you know, it’s—we’re not in a—we’re not in a world where we can afford to
rule, rule things out a full year in advance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—there’s just too much uncertainty in what we
do.</div>

MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Jean for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEAN YUNG.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I wanted to go
back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the
cumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path
to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal
under the average inflation-targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s not the way our framework works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re aiming
for inflation at, at 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re—we do not have—we do not think it would be appropriate
to deliberately undershoot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be
a problem, too, in a way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s not part of our framework, and it’s not something we’re
going to be—going to be looking at in our framework review.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much.</div>
