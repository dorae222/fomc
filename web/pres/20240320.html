Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 20, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Inflation has
eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path
forward is uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting
downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As labor market tightness has eased and
progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals
are moving into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high
mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In
our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to
slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over
the next two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December,
reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 1 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to
come into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs
per month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Strong job
creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in
participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Although the jobs-to-
workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>FOMC
participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this
year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile
food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The
median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent
next year, and 2 percent in 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 2 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks
to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We believe that
our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves
broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some
point this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to
inflation risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for
longer, if appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation
back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering any adjustments to the target range
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce
the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down
toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an
unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will
continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this
Page 3 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026, still above the medium—
median longer-term funds rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion
since the Committee began reducing our portfolio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At this meeting, we discussed issues related
to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>While we did not make any decisions
today on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of
runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The decision to slow the pace
of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would
otherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is
essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long
term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We, at the
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, the projections show
somewhat higher core inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>They also show somewhat stronger growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What should we
infer from this notion that, on average, rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher
and growth is higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness
to slow the economy to achieve that target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, it doesn’t—no, it doesn’t mean that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What it means is that, you
know, we’ve seen incoming—as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our
growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing, performing
well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused
people to write up their inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on
bringing inflation down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>When you—just to follow up: When you say that you’re willing to
either maintain the rate for longer, is—what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation
coming in above its 2 percent target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Markets believe we will
achieve that goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen
over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we stress “over time.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do
show that happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is
Page 5 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming, but it still hasn’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that challenge
your assumption about when the shift will finally break through, since it hasn’t at that point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower
market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation
over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real
confidence that they will show up eventually over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, again, uncertainty about the exact
timing of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if
housing doesn’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this
year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into
a new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this
year, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are
suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some
combination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before
the pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Chair Powell, during your
congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest
rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest
rates are well above neutral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first
cut is highly consequential.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you reconcile these views for me?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If rates are well above
Page 6 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that because you anticipate one cut
would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019,
which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our—
in my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We—we’re in a situation where,
you know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if
we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to be careful.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation
coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s
really what I was thinking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>How much of that inflation that we’ve seen so far this year do you
chalk up to one-off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some
change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about
dismissing data that we don’t like.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—
so I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers
were quite high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But,
nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The February number was high,
higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which
is not terribly high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s not like the January number.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I take the two of them together, and
I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down
gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think that story has changed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
Page 7 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also don’t think that those readings added to anyone’s confidence that we’re moving closer to, to
that point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, we didn’t—the last thing I’ll say is we didn’t excessively celebrate
the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We didn’t take too much
signal out of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you
know—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to
these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ANN SAPHIR.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, yes, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you speak a little bit more about the
timing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there enough data between now and, say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence
that you say you still need?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or, by June, is there enough data for you?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just give us a sense of
your thinking there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we make decisions meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we didn’t
make any decisions about future meetings today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those are going to depend on our ongoing
assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I really don’t
have anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean just a question of—I mean, is there even enough data for you to
be able to—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting
period, if you look back—unexpected things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss
anything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I also mentioned—and
we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data,
particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of
Page 8 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
reducing rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, I don’t—there’s nothing in the data pointing at that, but those are the
things that we’ll be looking at, at coming meetings and—without trying to refer to any specific
meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
the projections, there is an increase in the neutral rate, as you know, and higher rates—¼ point
higher rates projected in 2025, 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you speak about why, [what] might be behind that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is
there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will
be needed in the future?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and
’26.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I
don’t think we know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the
pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important,
slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that
don’t move quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I don’t think we know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not
go back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long-
run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t see rates going back
down to that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the projections, you also
have 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s already at—or you mentioned it
being 2.8 in February.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, that doesn’t sound like much disinflation at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So are you really,
are you still confident or—at the last press conference, you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you
Page 9 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would get more confidence at the end of this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is it right to say that this suggests you’re not
seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we’ve seen 2023 and so forth?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen
so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that—sorry, say your
last part of your question again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you still optimistic that you’ll get the confidence you need this
year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is
still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate
cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The other thing is, in the
second half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make
progress as you move that 12-month window forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that
confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence
that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to
potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in
the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And just in general, if labor supply
continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly
stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of
demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re
spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last
Page 10 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In fact, they
were decreasing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So you can have that if you have a continued supply-side activity that we had
last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to
hold off on rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, not all by itself.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, we saw—you saw last year very
strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We now have a better sense that a big part of
that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, in and of
itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do you assess the state of
financial conditions right now, and particularly—in particular, do you view the kind of easing in
financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you’re trying to
achieve on the inflation mandate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we think—there are many different financial conditions
indicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But,
ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think
you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling
off a little bit from the extremely high levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there I would point to job openings, quits,
surveys, the hiring rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Things like that are really demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are also supply-side things
happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we saw—that’s been
a question for a while.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite
financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Can you
give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What
we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there
more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And also
housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go
down, and they don’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve
raised your inflation forecast?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking
the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think
many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, again, you don’t
want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the question is, what are we going to
see?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger
inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to—
we’re going to let the data show.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the
road or something more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll have to find out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In the meantime, the economy is strong, the
labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach
this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at
2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 12 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that
inflation is continually moving down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Have the recent numbers we’ve gotten for inflation data
dented that confidence at all?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised
anyone’s confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of
inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that’s what you still see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve
had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a
bumpy ride.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We consistently said that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they
more than bumps?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we just don’t—we can’t know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s why we are approaching this
question carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation
sustainably down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the
historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the
first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately—
prematurely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Go to Edward.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from—well, the Federal Reserve is an
independent body, understanding Congress has oversight over that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You received a letter from
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said—calling on you to lower interest
rates—to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too
long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant
climate and economic benefits from these projects.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So has higher interest rates caused that?</div>

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Have they—well, first of all, I respect our—you know, in our system
of government, it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We place a
tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them
with great respect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In this case, I would say, those are, you know—our mandate is for maximum
employment and price stability and the other things that we do, and that’s what we’re trying to
accomplish.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we’re seeing, the
strong labor market we’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s
how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly
important, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for
those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying
that the higher rates are squeezing the working people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do these letters affect what you
guys are doing, policy-wise?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses
and address concerns.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system
of government, have oversight over our activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take
that on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”—
which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the
payment system: the things that we do.</div>

Committee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting
rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to
achieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People do dissent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s something that happens.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Life
goes on, and it’s not a problem.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve always had dissents.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—and so I—you know, you
respect thoughtful dissents very much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but
you really want to understand them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you may read a book that takes a position that you have
long opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you hear me?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Obviously, inflation is some ways away from
target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Unemployment, though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in
February, we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Are you
concerned at all that—notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth—that in fact there may be
some cracks appearing in the employment market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You talked about a significant deterioration
in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What would constitute that in your books?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We all
monitor the labor market very, very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I don’t see those cracks today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, you
know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but
the overall picture really is a strong labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The extreme imbalances that we saw in the
Page 15 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re seeing high job growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You’re seeing big increases in supply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You’re seeing strong wage growth, but wage growth is
gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In many, many respects, the things are
returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s
job openings and quits.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this:
You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How hard is it—how easy it is to find
a worker?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those have both—those surveys have both come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, you do see things like the low—
the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that
would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, initial claims are very, very
low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—watching it carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Don’t see it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So,
you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I
think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s just—that’s just people’s
forecast, individual forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s
where I’ll leave it, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE MATTHEWS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned at the
beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the
pace of asset runoff fairly soon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering is—when you say fairly soon, does that mean
that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that
soon?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is
Page 16 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
discussing here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re at $95 billion of caps right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would that be cut about in half or
something in that nature?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not
discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will discuss those in due course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There isn&#39;t much runoff among
MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re talking about going to a lower
pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an
agreement or decision, but that’s the idea.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what we’re looking at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than
that, but you get the idea.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually
be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there can be times when, in the aggregate,
reserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And those parts where they’re not
ample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the
stress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then it would be very hard to restart, we think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So something like that happened in
’19 perhaps.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what we’re doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re looking at what would be a good time and what
would be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And will there be a discussion about returning to an all-
Treasuries balance sheet at some point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that
is mostly Treasuries.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other
issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not
Page 17 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
urgent right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to get this, this decision made first and then we can, when the time is
right, come back to the other issues.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Also on the balance sheet, you
know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your
balance sheet plans?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you worry that, as deposits start to shrink, that we could see more
turbulence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ll be watching carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But one of the reasons
we’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we
want to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking-
sector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is our second time in
doing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to
happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle
where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t want to do that again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the
banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the
administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those sorts of
things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, is it also because you’re not sure exactly how the reserve
supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near—at zero?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight
[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet
Page 18 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
shrinks, we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar-for-dollar with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Jean.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEAN YUNG.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask
also about the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Will you—you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a
smaller balance sheet size.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that mean you don’t have to make a decision on when to end
QT at this point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner, or will you
wait until we’re close to the end?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
that’s the idea.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk
of kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the
process prematurely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully
money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about
reserves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re
aiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So there isn’t a—
you know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think
we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to be looking at what these—
what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the
ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then, though, you reach a point ultimately
where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s
another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and
that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you have a, you know, a slower pace of
runoff, which we’ll have fairly soon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then you have another time where you effectively hold the
Page 19 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
balance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then that ultimately
brings you, ideally, in for—brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above—you know,
above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not trying for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we
have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did
in 2019 and ’20.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Chair
Powell, you said you’re waiting to become more confident that inflation’s getting to your
2 percent goal before you cut rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you just sum up more specifically what data you’re
looking at that would give you that confidence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming
inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the
various components—so obviously that’s what we want.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We want more confidence that
inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, I mean, of course we’ll also be
looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll look at the totality of the
data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the most important thing
will be the inflation data coming in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, are there things that you would give more
weight to, like wages?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wages is one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t—our target is not wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s really
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong.</div>

they’ve been—wage increases, that’s to say—wage increases have been quite strong, but they’re,
they’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what
we want.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think,
by mostly by wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That wasn’t really the story.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But we do think that, to get inflation back
down to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of
wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Greg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GREG ROBB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, could you say
at this meeting whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than—
about rates—than there were at the last meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was there—was there that sense of maybe it’s
smart to wait?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming
inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we
were right to wait until we’re more confident.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone
dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, generally
speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we
approach this question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Brendan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>BRENDAN PEDERSEN.</div>

News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve been hearing a lot
from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know
you have said to Congress that you’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything—
launches anything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is

either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you
give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will—
I’ll try harder.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a
conclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to
authorize a digital dollar.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to
give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the
public.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re just a long, long way from that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What we are doing, and I think what every
major central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital
finance, and it has many, many different areas.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has applications in wholesale finance, in the
payment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front
burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we actually
do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on
a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to
spring it on Congress at the right moment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a
decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just think it’s something we
need to be—we need to understand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of
the broader payments landscape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s how I would characterize it.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman,
April 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper

functioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And is there more that
you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what might that look like?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years
ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the
public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’ll react
to the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and
greater transparency.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman
Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I. You know, so we went from four press conferences a
year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that’s a good innovation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
wouldn’t want to turn it back.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We also have done a bunch of other things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we have an annual supervision
report, Financial Stability Report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think
you—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re very transparent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public
through the media.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that channel is full, I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think it’s generally broadly
helped and made things better.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But not every day and in every way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, to follow up: Has there ever been a day where you wanted to
put that genie back in the bottle somewhat?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course not. [</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Jennifer, for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but you did say earlier
in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
Page 23 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not
far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So are you still of
that belief or not?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What are we to take by those words, “not far?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of
hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that
inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will
be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I said that
any number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We repeated that
today in our statement.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we
had made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation
that that progress will continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last
year that were really much lower.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s what I had in
mind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But given that you said that PCE for February,
2.8 percent the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE—core PCE coming down by a tenth
of a percent every month, I mean, wouldn’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June, July,
to a point where you could cut then?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We would, of
course, love to get great inflation data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We got really good inflation data on the second—in the
second part of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Again, we didn’t overreact to it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We said we needed to see more, and
we said it would be bumpy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a
couple of times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly
welcome it.</div>
