Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of
August.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy
restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>This decision reflects our
growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the
labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving
sustainably down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid
pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data
point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth of consumer spending has
remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic
pace last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising
strongly in the first.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the
strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our Summary of Economic
Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median
projection of 2 percent over the next few years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 1 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains averaged
116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in
the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage
growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, a broad
set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before
the pandemic in 2019.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year,
four-tenths higher than projected in June.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food
and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation expectations
appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households,
businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The median projection
in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat
lower than projected in June.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For much of the past three years,
inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely
tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 2 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply
and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well
anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much
closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation
have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We now see the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the
risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today’s meeting, the
Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to
4¾ percent to 5 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of
the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we
begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are not on any preset course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At
the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and
employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,
the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
Page 3 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this
year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These median projections are lower than in June,
consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the
changed balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy remains solid and inflation
persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to
respond.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in
pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In July, you said you weren’t necessarily thinking about a 50.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You didn’t want to be
specific, but you said you weren’t thinking about a 50.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The inflation data last week came out a
little firmer than expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what
Page 4 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it
shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I guess, should we expect more
50s in the months ahead?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And based on what should we make that call?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Laughter] Let me jump in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So,
since the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve had the
two employment reports, July and August.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one
that came in during blackout.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not
maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high
and will be revised down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data
collected in] the Beige Book.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we took all of those, and we went into blackout.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we
thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the
people that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s one question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What
was the second and third?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do we make the—sorry, thank you, sir.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do we figure out
in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that
call?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So a couple things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A good place to start is the—is the SEP,
but let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by
meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If you look at
the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from
where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s
more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that process will take
place over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to
Page 5 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
get this done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This, this process evolves over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, that’s a projection.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a
baseline projection.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do
will depend on the way the economy evolves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can go quicker if that’s appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We can
go slower if that’s appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can pause if that’s appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s, that’s what we are
contemplating.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the
Committee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are
thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
projections show that the Fed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their
estimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So does that suggest that you see rates as
restrictive for that entire period?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you
said you’d like to avoid?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little
bit higher?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I
think people write down their estimate, individuals do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think every single person on the
Committee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s
a wide range where that could fall.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think we don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are model-based
approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any
given time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, realistically, we know it by its works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that leaves us in a place where we’ll
be—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be
looking at the way the economy reacts to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the
question that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We know—if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a
time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Today, unemployment
is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we know that it is time to
recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and
on employment moving to a more sustainable level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the balance of risks are now even.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of
neutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What you have
is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How close was this in terms
of the decision?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was the weight
clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we had a good—a good discussion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, if you go
back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut
and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so there was a lot of
discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think there was also
broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would add, though, look at the
SEP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All 19.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a big change
from June, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Seven of the—seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the
19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you
know, there is a dissent, and there’s a range of views, but there’s actually a lot of common
ground as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 7 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Follow-up to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now that this is in the books, can you give
us some guidance as sort of a follow-up to Steve on the pacing here?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you expect this to
be running every other meeting once we get into next year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s
no sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We made a good, strong start to this,
and that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down
toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That gives us the ability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can, you know, make a
good, strong start.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—and I’m very pleased that we did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To me, the logic of this, both from an
economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think we’re
going to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for
taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the
unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Obviously, historically, when the
unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’t typically
just stop—it continues increasing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the
labor market stabilizing, sort of what’s the mechanism there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what do you see as the risks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our
intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can say that about the whole
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The U.S. economy is in good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming
down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s what we’re
doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 8 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry—Nick.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Chair Powell, does today’s
action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data,
or is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate
such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, multiple questions in there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would say we don’t think
we’re behind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of
our commitment not to get behind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s, it’s a strong move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, your other question was?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between
this meeting and the last meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or is this about the level of the funds rate—the high nominal
level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you’re trying to maintain equilibrium?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that
was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation
and very low unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve waited.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our
confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that is what enables
us to take this, this strong move today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I do not think that anyone should look at this and say,
“Oh, this is the new pace.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of
course, what happens will happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP,
you see cuts moving along.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a
more neutral level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given
Page 9 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
developments in the economy and the base case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy can develop in a way that would
cause us to go faster or slower, but that’s what the base case is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you
did the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With a larger cut today, is
there any—should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “end
state” on the balance sheet policy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They
haven’t come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As
you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this
at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know that these two things can happen side by side.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In a sense, they’re both a form of
normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting
rates.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just following up
on Jeanna’s question on rising unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Is it your view that this is just a function of a
normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something
more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have
softened too?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not—why should we not expect
a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have
cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level—
the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 10 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So you’re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what’s driving it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Clearly, clearly
payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many—
By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a
very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the labor market bears
close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But ultimately, we think—we believe,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing,
and that will support the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic
activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an
economy that is still growing at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that should also support the labor market over
time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but again, we’re—it bears watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to
happen, wouldn’t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin
to recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising
layoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something
that’s getting ready to happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there
is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when
we begin to see the layoffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s some lore on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s the situation we’re in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have,
in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that
we consider.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions
meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee.</div>

MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To follow up on
that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a
higher unemployment rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style—
rather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So if—as I
mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the
ability to react to that by, by cutting faster.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate,
though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to
2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ll be to the labor market,
since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant
amount of monetary easing to just maintain it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see
further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we have a
dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we
been trying to achieve?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability
without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we’re trying to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think you can take today’s action as a sign of our strong
commitment to achieve that goal.</div>

RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re describing this view that you don’t think you’re behind when it
comes to the job market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be
most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve mentioned a couple, but would you be
able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job
market now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most
important one probably.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re at 4.2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we
were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back
over the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Participation
is at high levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for
aging, participation’s at pretty high levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Wages are still a bit above what
would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the
very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to
what that sustainable level is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we feel good about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Vacancies over—per unemployed is
back to what is still a very strong level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not as high as it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That number reached two to
one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As measured, it’s now below—it’s around
one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, quits have come
back down to normal levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I could go on and on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>There are many, many employment
indicators.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What do they say?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>They say this is still a solid labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The question isn’t the
level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you
know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the
Page 13 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
downside risks to employment have increased.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and because we have been patient and held
our fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we’re now in a very good
position to manage the risks to both of our goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what do you expect to learn between now and November that
will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, more data, the usual.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Don’t look for anything else.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll
see another labor report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll see another jobs report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we get a—we might, actually—
we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the
Friday before the meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and inflation data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll get all this data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications
of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and
think, what’s the right thing to do?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of
our goals over time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve only been
running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you view that
level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be—would you be content if we
were to kind of stick at that level?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the
last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather
than job losses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor
market cooling will have to come through job losses?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows,
right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating
Page 14 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
100,000 jobs, you’re going to see unemployment go up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it really depends on what’s the trend
underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We understand there’s been quite an
influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed
the unemployment rate to rise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is
something we also watch carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think
everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long
way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment,
job loss.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things
with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that
further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s been—
it’s been a great ride down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor
market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½,
maybe under 4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near-
zero federal funds rate, and some think we’re heading in that direction again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s the
likelihood that cheap money is now the norm?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Intuitively, most—many,
many people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were
trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at
Page 15 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
negative rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so—and it
was—people were issuing debt at negative rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It seems that’s so far away now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My own sense
is that we’re not going back to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, you
know, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was
back then.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How high is it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t—I just don’t think we know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—again, we only know it by
its works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will
likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,
and, you know, it’s always the same.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in
particular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we do that, and
we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s—that’s always what it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s
never about anything else.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things
that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, nonetheless, this is
what we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, if we
get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this really concentrates the
mind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t put up any other
filters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we just don’t do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jo Ling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JO LING KENT.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My first
question is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the
American people, with this unusually large rate cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place,
and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>More specifically, the economy is
growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and
the labor market is still in solid shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we
currently see in the U.S. economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ll do that by returning rates from their high level,
which has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re,
we’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just have a follow-up to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Listening to you talk about inflation
moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive
victory over inflation and rising prices?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, we’re not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So inflation, you know—what we say is we want
inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you
know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think we’re going
to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re
certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I have
to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Catarina.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CATARINA SARAIVA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just would love
to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we’ve seen in housing
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging
a bit, if I can say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which
Page 17 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’re not rolling over—the leases that are
rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, you know, it’s been
slower than we expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those
lower market rents to get into this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as
market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time
it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As long
as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would say it’s—the
rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I
believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services
piece, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with
starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing
market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People don’t want to sell their homes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As rates
come down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many
cases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean,
the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough
housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so it’s going to be challenging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places
Page 18 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where people want to live.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and,
you know, where are we going to get the supply?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And this is not something that the Fed can, can
really fix.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, I
mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and
getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And then
the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Just following up on some of the
labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and
I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too
much comes from the fact that you’re starting to act now and that’s going to give people more
room to run versus just the labor market is strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then, also, if I could, following up on
Nick’s question, do you see today’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that
you didn’t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at forecasters or
talk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s no
sense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know,
business people who are actually out there doing business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, you know, I think our
move is timely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as I said, you can—you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a
commitment to make sure that we don’t fall behind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re really asking about—your second question, you’re asking about July.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I
guess if you ask if we’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We might
Page 19 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We didn’t make that decision, but we might well have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think that’s not—you know,
that doesn’t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let’s look, you know—at
this meeting we’re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report,
the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things
that I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re looking at all of those things, and we’re asking ourselves, what’s the
right—what’s the policy stance we need to move to?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We knew—it’s clear that we—clearly,
literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’s time to move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just how big—how fast
do you go, and what do you think about the paths forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this decision we made today had
broad support on the Committee, and I’ve discussed the path ahead.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Elizabeth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Elizabeth Schulze with ABC
News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>How
much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Very hard for me to say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really
speak to mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our intention,
though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think that it’s time to
begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come
down as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the
economy performs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to
be doing—going to be doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 20 of 26

ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What’s your message to households who are frustrated that
home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What do you say to those
households?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had
a burst of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and,
when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy
off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s not something that people experience as
pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And a
good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about
inflation anymore.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just keep it low, keep it stable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re restoring that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what we’re going through now really
restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability benefits everybody
over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I completely—we don’t
tell people how to think about the economy, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, of course, people are [still]
experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we understand that’s painful.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GREG ROBB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was wondering
if you could go through—you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was
like an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would sort of
argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President
John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the
day.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, I mean, could you talk—
Page 21 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a
50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was
a really small probability of a 50 point cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that play in your consideration at all?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just talk
a little bit about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for
the economy at that time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we’ll do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what we did today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve mentioned how closely you’re watching the labor market, but you also noted
that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward
revisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And given the
SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be
the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,
including the payroll numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not discarding those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, we’ll certainly look at those,
but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There isn’t a bright line.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of
course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move
that would dictate one thing or another.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data
on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our
policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I
can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.</div>

MATT EGAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Matt Egan from CNN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I know that you discussed
earlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, in general,
can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed
decisions on interest rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Because that’s something that former President Trump, who
obviously appointed you, has previously suggested.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I know the Fed is designed to be
independent, but why?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So countries that are—democracies around the world,
countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central
banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from
direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe
people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s the idea, is that—
you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get
lower inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not
serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s just maximum
employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s how the other central
banks are set up, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public
and I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kyle Campbell for American Banker.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking the
questions, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask
you about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the
changes to the Basel III endgame.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what
those changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you’re looking
Page 23 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then
yesterday, other banking regulators—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know what, hold the second question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll give you the second question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the answer to your question
is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with
my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that
Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, yes, that is—that’s happening
with my support.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there a date for that—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re putting
them out for comment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t
have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea
is that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly
where that is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment,
and then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them,
and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then, yesterday.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>there were merger reform finalizations
from the other bank regulators.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair
Barr.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer, for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 24 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration
strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even
though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly
balanced.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given what you’ve said, though, today, I’m curious, are you more worried about the
job market and growth than inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are they not roughly balanced?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We had a historically tight labor
market, historically tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we
had inflation way above target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation,
concentrate on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put
in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Part of
bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor
market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what that tells
you is, it’s time to change our stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we did that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The sense of the change in the stance is
that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And today
was—I think we made a good strong start on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it was the right decision, and I think it
should send a signal that we, you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome
here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that
could tip it into recession?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it
this way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a
Page 25 of 26

recession—sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You see—you see growth at
a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that’s, that’s still at very
solid levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so I don’t really see that, no.</div>
