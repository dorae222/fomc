Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 20, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</span> <small>(0.817)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Inflation has
eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path
forward is uncertain.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting
downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</span> <small>(0.661)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As labor market tightness has eased and
progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals
are moving into better balance.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.852)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.415)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high
mortgage rates.</span> <small>(0.592)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment.</span> <small>(0.662)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In
our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to
slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over
the next two years.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December,
reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 1 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to
come into better balance.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs
per month.</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Strong job
creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in
participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Although the jobs-to-
workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">FOMC
participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on
inflation.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this
year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of
2 percent.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile
food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The
median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent
next year, and 2 percent in 2026.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 2 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
holdings.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks
to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We believe that
our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves
broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some
point this year.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to
inflation risks.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for
longer, if appropriate.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation
back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In considering any adjustments to the target range
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce
the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down
toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an
unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will
continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this
Page 3 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026, still above the medium—
median longer-term funds rate.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion
since the Committee began reducing our portfolio.</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At this meeting, we discussed issues related
to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.714)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">While we did not make any decisions
today on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of
runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The decision to slow the pace
of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would
otherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</span> <small>(0.740)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is
essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long
term.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We, at the
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.714)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, the projections show
somewhat higher core inflation.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">They also show somewhat stronger growth.</span> <small>(0.354)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What should we
infer from this notion that, on average, rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher
and growth is higher.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness
to slow the economy to achieve that target?</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, it doesn’t—no, it doesn’t mean that.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What it means is that, you
know, we’ve seen incoming—as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our
growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing, performing
well.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused
people to write up their inflation.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on
bringing inflation down.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">When you—just to follow up: When you say that you’re willing to
either maintain the rate for longer, is—what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation
coming in above its 2 percent target?</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Markets believe we will
achieve that goal.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen
over time.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we stress “over time.”</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do
show that happening.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is
Page 5 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming, but it still hasn’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that challenge
your assumption about when the shift will finally break through, since it hasn’t at that point?</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower
market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation
over time.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real
confidence that they will show up eventually over time.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, again, uncertainty about the exact
timing of that.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if
housing doesn’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this
year?</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
will.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into
a new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this
year, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are
suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some
combination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before
the pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.786)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Chair Powell, during your
congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest
rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest
rates are well above neutral.</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first
cut is highly consequential.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you reconcile these views for me?</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If rates are well above
Page 6 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that because you anticipate one cut
would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019,
which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995?</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our—
in my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We—we’re in a situation where,
you know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if
we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives.</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We want to be careful.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation
coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.</span> <small>(0.374)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
really what I was thinking.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">How much of that inflation that we’ve seen so far this year do you
chalk up to one-off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some
change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about
dismissing data that we don’t like.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But—
so I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers
were quite high.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But,
nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The February number was high,
higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which
is not terribly high.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s not like the January number.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I take the two of them together, and
I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down
gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think that story has changed.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I

also don’t think that those readings added to anyone’s confidence that we’re moving closer to, to
that point.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we didn’t—the last thing I’ll say is we didn’t excessively celebrate
the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We didn’t take too much
signal out of that.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you
know—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to
these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">ANN SAPHIR.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, yes, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could you speak a little bit more about the
timing?</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is there enough data between now and, say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence
that you say you still need?</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or, by June, is there enough data for you?</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just give us a sense of
your thinking there.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we make decisions meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we didn’t
make any decisions about future meetings today.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those are going to depend on our ongoing
assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I really don’t
have anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting
period, if you look back—unexpected things.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss
anything.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I also mentioned—and
we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data,
particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of

reducing rates.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, I don’t—there’s nothing in the data pointing at that, but those are the
things that we’ll be looking at, at coming meetings and—without trying to refer to any specific

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.730)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
the projections, there is an increase in the neutral rate, as you know, and higher rates—¼ point
higher rates projected in 2025, 2026.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you speak about why, [what] might be behind that?</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is
there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will
be needed in the future?</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and
’26.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I
don’t think we know that.</span> <small>(0.612)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the
pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important,
slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that
don’t move quickly.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I don’t think we know.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not
go back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long-
run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t see rates going back
down to that level.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRIS RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the projections, you also
have 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s already at—or you mentioned it
being 2.8 in February.</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, that doesn’t sound like much disinflation at all.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So are you really,
are you still confident or—at the last press conference, you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you
Page 9 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would get more confidence at the end of this year.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Is it right to say that this suggests you’re not
seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we’ve seen 2023 and so forth?</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen
so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that—sorry, say your
last part of your question again.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you still optimistic that you’ll get the confidence you need this
year?</span> <small>(0.371)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is
still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate
cuts.</span> <small>(0.348)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The other thing is, in the
second half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make
progress as you move that 12-month window forward.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that
confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence
that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.</span> <small>(0.741)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you for taking our
questions.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to
potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in
the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts?</span> <small>(0.360)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And just in general, if labor supply
continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly
stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of
demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re
spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last
Page 10 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In fact, they
were decreasing.</span> <small>(0.338)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So you can have that if you have a continued supply-side activity that we had
last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.</span> <small>(0.399)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to
hold off on rate cuts?</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, not all by itself.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, we saw—you saw last year very
strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We now have a better sense that a big part of
that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, in and of
itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.</span> <small>(0.359)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin with Axios.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do you assess the state of
financial conditions right now, and particularly—in particular, do you view the kind of easing in
financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you’re trying to
achieve on the inflation mandate?</span> <small>(0.686)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we think—there are many different financial conditions
indicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But,
ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think
you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling
off a little bit from the extremely high levels.</span> <small>(0.374)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there I would point to job openings, quits,
surveys, the hiring rate.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Things like that are really demand.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are also supply-side things
happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we saw—that’s been
a question for a while.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite
financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Can you
give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">What
we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there
more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky?</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And also
housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go
down, and they don’t.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve
raised your inflation forecast?</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking
the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think
many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, again, you don’t
want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the question is, what are we going to
see?</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger
inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to—
we’re going to let the data show.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the
road or something more.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll have to find out.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In the meantime, the economy is strong, the
labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach
this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at
2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.</span> <small>(0.385)</small></p>

MICHAEL MCKEE.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that
inflation is continually moving down.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Have the recent numbers we’ve gotten for inflation data
dented that confidence at all?</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised
anyone’s confidence.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of
inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that’s what you still see.</span> <small>(0.392)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve
had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a
bumpy ride.</span> <small>(0.402)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We consistently said that.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they
more than bumps?</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we just don’t—we can’t know that.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s why we are approaching this
question carefully.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation
sustainably down.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the
historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the
first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately—
prematurely.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You received a letter from
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said—calling on you to lower interest
rates—to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too

climate and economic benefits from these projects.”</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>

accomplish.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we’re seeing, the

those.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you hear me?</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Great.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Obviously, inflation is some ways away from
target.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Unemployment, though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in
February, we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Are you
concerned at all that—notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth—that in fact there may be
some cracks appearing in the employment market?</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You talked about a significant deterioration
in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What would constitute that in your books?</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables.</span> <small>(0.770)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We all
monitor the labor market very, very carefully.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I don’t see those cracks today.</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, you
know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but
the overall picture really is a strong labor market.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The extreme imbalances that we saw in the
Page 15 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re seeing high job growth.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You’re seeing big increases in supply.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You’re seeing strong wage growth, but wage growth is
gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In many, many respects, the things are
returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
job openings and quits.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this:
You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How hard is it—how easy it is to find
a worker?</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those have both—those surveys have both come down.</span> <small>(0.765)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, you do see things like the low—
the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that
would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it.</span> <small>(0.399)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, initial claims are very, very
low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—watching it carefully.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Don’t see it.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So,
you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I
think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s just—that’s just people’s
forecast, individual forecasts.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected.</span> <small>(0.399)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
where I’ll leave it, though.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE MATTHEWS.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned at the
beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the
pace of asset runoff fairly soon.</span> <small>(0.737)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m wondering is—when you say fairly soon, does that mean
that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that
soon?</span> <small>(0.367)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is
Page 16 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
discussing here.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re at $95 billion of caps right now.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would that be cut about in half or
something in that nature?</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not
discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will discuss those in due course.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There isn&#39;t much runoff among
MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re talking about going to a lower
pace.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an
agreement or decision, but that’s the idea.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what we’re looking at.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.</span> <small>(0.772)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than
that, but you get the idea.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually
be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there can be times when, in the aggregate,
reserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And those parts where they’re not
ample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the
stress.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then it would be very hard to restart, we think.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So something like that happened in
’19 perhaps.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what we’re doing.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re looking at what would be a good time and what
would be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And will there be a discussion about returning to an all-
Treasuries balance sheet at some point?</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that
is mostly Treasuries.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other
issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not
Page 17 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
urgent right now.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We want to get this, this decision made first and then we can, when the time is
right, come back to the other issues.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">VICTORIA GUIDA.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Also on the balance sheet, you
know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your
balance sheet plans?</span> <small>(0.740)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you worry that, as deposits start to shrink, that we could see more
turbulence?</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ll be watching carefully.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But one of the reasons
we’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we
want to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking-
sector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is our second time in
doing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to
happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle
where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t want to do that again.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the
banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the
administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those sorts of
things.</span> <small>(0.741)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.</span> <small>(0.811)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, is it also because you’re not sure exactly how the reserve
supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near—at zero?</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight
[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet
Page 18 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
shrinks, we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar-for-dollar with that.</span> <small>(0.672)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we think.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Jean.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEAN YUNG.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask
also about the balance sheet.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Will you—you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a
smaller balance sheet size.</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that mean you don’t have to make a decision on when to end
QT at this point?</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner, or will you
wait until we’re close to the end?</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
that’s the idea.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk
of kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the
process prematurely.</span> <small>(0.801)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully
money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about
reserves.</span> <small>(0.766)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re
aiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So there isn’t a—
you know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think
we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to be looking at what these—
what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the
ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then, though, you reach a point ultimately
where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s
another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and
that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you have a, you know, a slower pace of
runoff, which we’ll have fairly soon.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then you have another time where you effectively hold the
Page 19 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
balance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand.</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then that ultimately
brings you, ideally, in for—brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above—you know,
above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not trying for that.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we
have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did
in 2019 and ’20.</span> <small>(0.797)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Chair
Powell, you said you’re waiting to become more confident that inflation’s getting to your
2 percent goal before you cut rates.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you just sum up more specifically what data you’re
looking at that would give you that confidence?</span> <small>(0.376)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming
inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the
various components—so obviously that’s what we want.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We want more confidence that
inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, I mean, of course we’ll also be
looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy.</span> <small>(0.800)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll look at the totality of the
data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the most important thing
will be the inflation data coming in.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, are there things that you would give more
weight to, like wages?</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wages is one thing.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t—our target is not wages.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s really
inflation.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But, but
Page 20 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
they’ve been—wage increases, that’s to say—wage increases have been quite strong, but they’re,
they’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what
we want.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think,
by mostly by wages.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That wasn’t really the story.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But we do think that, to get inflation back
down to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of
wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Greg.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, could you say
at this meeting whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than—
about rates—than there were at the last meeting?</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Was there—was there that sense of maybe it’s
smart to wait?</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming
inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we
were right to wait until we’re more confident.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone
dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, generally
speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we

either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you
give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will—
I’ll try harder.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a
conclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to
authorize a digital dollar.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to
give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the
public.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re just a long, long way from that.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What we are doing, and I think what every
major central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital
finance, and it has many, many different areas.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has applications in wholesale finance, in the
payment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front
burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that.</span> <small>(0.776)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we actually
do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on
a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to
spring it on Congress at the right moment.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a
decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just think it’s something we
need to be—we need to understand.</span> <small>(0.383)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of
the broader payments landscape.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s how I would characterize it.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MARK HAMRICK.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman,
April 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news
conferences.</span> <small>(0.789)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper

functioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission?</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And is there more that
you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front?</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what might that look like?</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years
ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the
public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’ll react
to the data.</span> <small>(0.628)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and
greater transparency.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman
Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I. You know, so we went from four press conferences a
year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that’s a good innovation.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
wouldn’t want to turn it back.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also have done a bunch of other things.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we have an annual supervision
report, Financial Stability Report.</span> <small>(0.718)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think
you—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment.</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re very transparent.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public
through the media.</span> <small>(0.816)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that channel is full, I would say.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it’s generally broadly
helped and made things better.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But not every day and in every way.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, to follow up: Has there ever been a day where you wanted to
put that genie back in the bottle somewhat?</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course not. [</span> <small>(0.711)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Jennifer, for the last question.</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>

Yahoo Finance.</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but you did say earlier
in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
Page 23 of 24

March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not
far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates.”</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So are you still of
that belief or not?</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What are we to take by those words, “not far?”</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of
hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that
inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will
be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I said that
any number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We repeated that
today in our statement.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we
had made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation
that that progress will continue.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last
year that were really much lower.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned.</span> <small>(0.356)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s what I had in
mind.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But given that you said that PCE for February,
2.8 percent the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE—core PCE coming down by a tenth
of a percent every month, I mean, wouldn’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June, July,
to a point where you could cut then?</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We would, of
course, love to get great inflation data.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We got really good inflation data on the second—in the
second part of last year.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Again, we didn’t overreact to it.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We said we needed to see more, and
we said it would be bumpy.</span> <small>(0.357)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a
couple of times.</span> <small>(0.718)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly
welcome it.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
