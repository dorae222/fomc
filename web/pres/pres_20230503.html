Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 3, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.682)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment
briefly on recent developments in the banking sector.</span> <small>(0.791)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Conditions in that sector have broadly
improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient.</span> <small>(0.716)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will
continue to monitor conditions in the sector.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are committed to learning the right lessons
from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As a first
step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the
Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The review’s findings
underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and
more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so.</span> <small>(0.810)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">My
colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly
committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Since early last
year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are
also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent
approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will

have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</span> <small>(0.821)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 0.9 percent.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be
modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Activity in the housing sector
remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Higher interest rates and
slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market remains very tight.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the first three months of the year, job gains
averaged 345,000 jobs per month.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at
3.5 percent.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming back into better balance.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent
months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth has sown—
shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But overall, labor
demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the 12 months
ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle
of last year.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting
inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite elevated inflation, longer-term
inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re continuing to [carry
out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.771)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more
than a year.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It will take time,
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit
conditions.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to
our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the strains that emerged in the banking
sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses.</span> <small>(0.783)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The extent of these effects remains uncertain.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have
put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold.</span> <small>(0.817)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In determining the
extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over
time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags
with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial
developments.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of
Page 3 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we
are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.</span> <small>(0.785)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer
run.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a
suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I also
wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March
minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they’re envisioning would look and feel like when
it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A, a decision on a pause was not made today.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You will
have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the
Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That sentence is,
is not in, in the statement anymore.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in
Page 4 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation
to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors.</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we—that’s a—
that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.</span> <small>(0.361)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’ll be
driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’ll approach that question at
the June meeting.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not
my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a
modest rate this year.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different
forecasts.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [</span> <small>(0.753)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The] staff produces its
own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the
Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we think this is a healthy thing—
that the, the staff is writing down what they really think.</span> <small>(0.569)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re not especially influenced by
what the Governors think, and vice versa.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Governors are not taking what the staff says and
just writing that down.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can
have different perspectives.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I
would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical
in modern-era recessions.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible
effects of a debt-limit standoff.</span> <small>(0.746)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do
you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default?</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what type of situation
would that look like?</span> <small>(0.717)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:
These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the
Administration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with.</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And they’re really
consigned to them.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling
be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A failure to do that would be unprecedented.</span> <small>(0.380)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the
consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite
a[d]verse.</span> <small>(0.606)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’ll just leave it there.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we don’t give advice to either side.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We just would
point out that it—that it’s very important that this be done.</span> <small>(0.372)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the, the other point I’ll make
about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the
potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.</span> <small>(0.770)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we—
it’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place
where we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not
paying its bills.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just a follow-up.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Was discussion around the uncertainty of a
possible standoff—did that affect today’s monetary policy decision at all?</span> <small>(0.785)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say that it did.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was—of course, it’s something that
came up.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A
number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say that it was important in
today’s monetary policy decision.</span> <small>(0.804)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation
Page 6 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest
rate risks?</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ve done in the wake of the recent
bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk?</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And kind of part 3, but it’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation
principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?</span> <small>(0.733)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very
well.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I did remember it.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
what it was was a general presentation.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was an informational briefing of the whole Board—
the entire Board.</span> <small>(0.803)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think all members were there.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it was about interest rate risk in the banks
and, and lots of data.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you
know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio.</span> <small>(0.778)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There
was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run.</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it was—I
think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry,
horizontal assessment of, of banks.</span> <small>(0.793)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming
situation.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I
thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many
banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the
events of, of early March, to build liquidity.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you asked about the separation principle.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—
you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the
financial stability tools are not in conflict.</span> <small>(0.787)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re both—they’re working well together.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve
used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, at the

same time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment
and price stability.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, I’m sorry.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t mean to be argumentative, but
the, the staff report said, “SVB . . .</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">has significant interest rate risk.”</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It said, “Interest rate risk
measurement[s] . . .</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">failed” at SVB.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it said, “Banks with large unrealized losses face
significant safety and soundness risks.”</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why was that not alarming?</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was—they’re
pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you
know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually.</span> <small>(0.395)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They mentioned
that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters
requiring attention.</span> <small>(0.684)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that was also in the presentation.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it was to say: Yes, this is
a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the
case.</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Victoria.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">VICTORIA GUIDA.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask—obviously, with the recent
bank turmoil, we’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I was just curious whether you
think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial
stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even
larger.</span> <small>(0.697)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to
further consolidate banks.</span> <small>(0.712)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking
industry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.</span> <small>(0.711)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks.</span> <small>(0.688)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now there
Page 8 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
are 4,000 and change.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s going on.</span> <small>(0.389)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I personally have long felt that having small-,
medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system.</span> <small>(0.771)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, the
community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important
purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well.</span> <small>(0.697)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it’s healthy to have a, you
know, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things.</span> <small>(0.775)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that’s a
positive thing.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First
Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.</span> <small>(0.848)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you know,
there’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank.</span> <small>(0.756)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it was legitimate.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think the
FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would assume
that’s what they did.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So do you have any concerns about the fact that they’re, they’re
getting larger in general?</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the
largest banks doing big acquisitions.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is the policy.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And—but this is—this is an exception
for a failing bank.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system.</span> <small>(0.788)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It also
would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the
regional banks bought, bought this company.</span> <small>(0.754)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that could have been the outcome.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But,
ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost
bid.</span> <small>(0.753)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now to Colby.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</span> <small>(0.813)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the March
meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be
Page 9 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
equal to one or more rate increases.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, given developments since then, how has your estimate
changed?</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite
impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, in principle, that’s the
idea.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit,
and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of
broadly similar way.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one
and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it.</span> <small>(0.691)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, ultimately, we
have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But I
think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have
to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The extent of that is so
hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t
know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s, that’s what
we’ll be watching carefully to find out.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the
Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains
strong then, if, if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as
we want to find ourselves.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent
to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by
meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in
Page 10 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the statement, the obvious factors.</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s really all we can do.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad
understanding of monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.793)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Credit tightening is a different thing.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a lot of
literature on that.</span> <small>(0.806)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even
further uncertainty.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions—
what’s happening with lending.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We get—there’s a lot of data on that.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’ll,
we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, noting that
the statement dropped the reference to “sufficiently” restricted—“restrictive,” I was wondering,
given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact,
sufficiently restrictive.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to need data
to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think
we’ve reached that point.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March
meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was—
this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know that.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to—
before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you
know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I have a follow-up on credit.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could you give us a sense of
what the SLOOS survey indicated?</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were
Page 11 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
tightening credit as of the, the last survey.</span> <small>(0.784)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What did this one show, and how did that weigh into
your deliberations?</span> <small>(0.641)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line
with our usual time frame.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you
see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing
from other sources.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls
that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really
since the second half of last year.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Nick.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.737)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, the argument
around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was
to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">After the bank failures in March, as
you’ve discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So my question is
why it was necessary to raise interest rates today.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of
slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ve, for the last two
meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to
keep moving?</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy
we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of
policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over
time.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think slowing
down was the right move.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do
Page 12 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
so.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We always have to balance
the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of
maybe slowing down economic activity too much.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we thought that this rate hike, along
with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to
Howard’s question—you’ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently
restrictive stance.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period
than a six-week intermeeting cycle?</span> <small>(0.641)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment
will be an ongoing one.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you
can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look, look back.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve seen inflation
come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve seen inflation have
a few months of coming down and then come right back up.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think you’re going to want to
see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve
got this right, kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis
points.</span> <small>(0.719)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that policy is tight.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them
many different ways.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable
estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’ve got 2 percent
real rates.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would,
would assess as, you know, the neutral rate.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So policy is tight.</span> <small>(0.592)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you see that in interest—
interest-sensitive activities.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s

ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly
even at—that level.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence with
Fox Business.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections
show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of
3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our
target.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent?</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a
question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, ultimately,
we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have a, a goal of getting to
2 percent.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think it’s going to take some time.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How does the other side of the mandate—the jobs side—once
you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at
that point.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight.</span> <small>(0.399)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You still got
1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, overall, you’re near a
50-year low in unemployment.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late
Page 14 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last week, and it’s—whenever it was.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points
above what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So we do
see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These are very positive developments.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well
above our—well above our goal.</span> <small>(0.362)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation
down.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MATTHEW BOESLER.</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed
officials’ projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast
as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I’m just wondering if you
could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’re optimistic that a recession can be avoided,
given that that’s the Fed staff’s forecast—possibly also the broader Committee’s forecast as
well—and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters’.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the
Summary of Economic Projections and all that.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you
said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first-
quarter GDP at that point.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Anyway,
in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different.</span> <small>(0.397)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s, it’s
interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the
unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was
when we started.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So job openings are still very, very high.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see—by surveys and much,
Page 15 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
much [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s—it really is
different.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of
the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, that’s what we’ve seen.</span> <small>(0.360)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
we—there are no promises in this.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can
continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment
that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, that would be against history.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I
fully appreciate that.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That would be against the, the pattern.</span> <small>(0.650)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But I do think that it—that this, that
the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are
actually—wages have been moving down.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a
good sign—down to a more sustainable level.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that—I think it’s still possible.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—you
know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely
than that of having, having a recession.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession
is—I don’t rule that out, either.</span> <small>(0.575)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild
recession.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still
well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you see that as well?</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look at a range of wage, wage measures.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then
that’s in nominal.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases
plus inflation.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation
index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically,
those four and many others.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have
to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They can
Page 16 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deviate.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, corporate margins can go up and down.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there is a feature of long
expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a
recession—sorry, later in an expansion.</span> <small>(0.392)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, yeah.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The, the—you know, and we calculate those,
and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would say that what
they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer
to where they need to be.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take
to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—by the way, I don’t want
to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re asking me a very
specific question.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think there are many things.</span> <small>(0.592)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I think wages and prices tend to move together.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know,
that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRIS RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Great.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, you mentioned
profit margins.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And
while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’t
fallen as much as might be expected, given that we’re seeing at least some pullback among
consumer spending.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a
driver of higher prices?</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to
reduced inflation in the coming months?</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you
have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or,
or not flexible enough.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.</span> <small>(0.767)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we
Page 17 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation
come down.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of
full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then it’s—then it’s, then
you’re really back to full competition.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.</span> <small>(0.383)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you
tell us something about what your policy reaction function is—your policy framework is going
forward?</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data,
which is, by definition, backward looking?</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you going to be forecasting what you think is
going to happen?</span> <small>(0.382)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I didn’t catch the last part.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rolling?</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you
rule that out?</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Oh, yes.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry, sorry, sorry.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Okay, I got it.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, what are we looking
at?</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts.</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, the whole idea is
to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re always, always
looking at both.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things.</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’ll be readings
on inflation.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of
those many things.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks
now and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening?</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are small and
medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on
lending?</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.813)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’ll, that’ll be an important thing.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—
Page 18 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are shrinking the
balance sheet.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but
perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we have to factor all of that in and, and
make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.</span> <small>(0.697)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is
challenging.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What about the idea of rate cuts?</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is
going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And in that world, if that forecast
is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If you
have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in,
you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s not
our forecast.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation
moves down.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved
much.</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s quite stable.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to
weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to
begin to see progress there.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate
for us to cut rates.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Courtenay.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m curious how you view the
role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress.</span> <small>(0.838)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you
think it’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of
the facility?</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.</span> <small>(0.378)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now.</span> <small>(0.386)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It hasn’t actually
been growing.</span> <small>(0.364)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.</span> <small>(0.382)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have
really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits
and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home
Loan Banks and things like that.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had
been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits
into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What
was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and
spreading them around and things like that.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect
overall on the overnight repo facility.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re
supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sarah.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SARAH EWALL-WICE.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I want to go back to the debt
ceiling for a moment.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just
speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the
markets, and borrowing?</span> <small>(0.817)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be—
we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills.</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It just—it just

shouldn’t be a thing.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the
Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally
from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Scott.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SCOTT HORSLEY.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Scott Horsley for NPR.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In his report last
week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the
regulatory—or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt
all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift
towards less aggressive oversight.</span> <small>(0.661)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You were here in 2019.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you share that view, and what
would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be
necessary?</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the
work, but I do—I have read it, of course.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I find it persuasive.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I would say it this
way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly
and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system.</span> <small>(0.666)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think
the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened,
and, and identify what we need to do to address that.</span> <small>(0.366)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some of that is—may, it may just have
been technology evolving.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we have to keep up with all that.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But some of it may be
our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What our job is now is, identify those
things and implement them.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I
feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Evan.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>

EVAN RYSER.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Evan Ryser with MNI Market News.</span> <small>(0.688)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, are we
in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks?</span> <small>(0.807)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates?</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that what the statement is saying?</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There were
three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we—
that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress.</span> <small>(0.714)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those have now all been resolved, and
all the depositors have been protected.</span> <small>(0.714)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic
kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that
period of, of severe stress.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with
credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and
you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized
banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s going
to be the macroeconomic effect of that?</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully
monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our
decisions in an important way, going forward.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GREG ROBB.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Fed Chairman.</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just
wondered if you’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up
to it over the last—since you’ve been Fed Chairman, I think I’ve heard you say a couple of times
that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you think that was the right way to go
about this?</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, yeah, comments on that.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for
five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ve learned some
Page 22 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
new things as well, and we need to do better.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was
unflinching and appropriately so.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I welcome it.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I agree with and will support those
recommendations.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster
measures that will address the problems.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know,
the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.</span> <small>(0.684)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Vice Chair, it says, shall
deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding
supervision and regulation of depository institution . . .</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">companies . . . ,</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">and shall oversee the
supervision and regulation of such firms.”</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for
someone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets
to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors.</span> <small>(0.716)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Congress wanted
that person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the way it
works—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I give
my, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that.</span> <small>(0.682)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I have good conversations,
and I try to contribute constructively.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that
person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think
that’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I believe that’s what the law
requires.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an
intelligent discussion about what’s going on and why.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, that’s, that’s my input.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of
Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just wondered if you have any regrets?</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or was there anything that, you
know—decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what’s happened?</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>

CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve had a few, sure.</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, you know, who doesn’t look back and
think that you could have done things differently?</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do
that.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As one of my great mentors used to
always say, “Control the controllable.”</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn
the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them.</span> <small>(0.760)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and I think that, that
Vice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MEGAN CASSELLA.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, there.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Did the possibility of
pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered?</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m curious if
you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again
or what those discussions entailed.</span> <small>(0.733)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across
the board.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the
minutes.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But people did talk about pausing,
but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re,
we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you
know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various
channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and we’re going to be looking at
those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the
statement.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report
or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just think
we’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think we can
afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ve learned from the banking
crisis—that you would learn the right lessons.</span> <small>(0.765)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What are those lessons?</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which
is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through
history.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in
supervision.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought
that was possible.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite
so quickly.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that, you know, that will play through.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I, you know—it will be up to
Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think—I think
that’s one thing.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I guess I would just say that.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then, you know—that we’re going to—
obviously, we’re going to revisit [this].</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that
we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m, I’m
thinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you be any more specific on stress testing or
looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?</span> <small>(0.825)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s—see, that’s, that’s what Vice Chair Barr’s role really
is, and he’ll take the lead on that.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
