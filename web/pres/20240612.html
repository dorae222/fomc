Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 12, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the
past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains
and a low unemployment rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to
2.7 percent but is still too high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent
goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in
order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more to say
about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half
of 2023.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains
solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last
year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance
of the U.S. economy over the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee
participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median
projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 1 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong
but a bit below that seen in the first quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low
at 4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25
to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has eased over
the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Overall, a broad set of indicators
suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve
of the pandemic—relatively tight but not overheated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>FOMC participants expect labor market
strength to continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the
end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The consumer price
index—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE, PCE price index—
rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The
inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly
readings have eased somewhat.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters,
as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE
inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As
labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The economic
outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the
federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably
toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The most
recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there
has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We will need to see more good
data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress that we’ve seen on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or
too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering any
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this
year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But these projections are
Page 3 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As the economy evolves, assessments of the
appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we’re prepared to
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the labor
market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated,
we’re prepared to respond.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that
we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the
balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is essential to
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering
on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that our actions affect communities,
families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public
mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and
price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Just wondering
if you could walk me through the Committee’s average inflation forecast—core PCE is now
forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year-end.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s already 2.75, and after today’s number, there
were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that tell
Page 4 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and, in fact, that it’s going to
get worse?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you have this wrong, doesn’t it mean that you sort of—you, you could have
wrong the outlook for rates there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in
the second half of last year—June through December, really.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re now lapping those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
as you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes
in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The new reading gets added to the 12-month window.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s just a, a slight element of
conservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly
PCE and core PCE numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And if
you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the
12-month, you know, reading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just
the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we were to get more readings like today’s
reading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s just a forecasting device.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think, I
think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But if it comes in—just to follow up—if it comes in the way you
forecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah—no.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we
don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more
confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that
this rules that in or out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month
by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or, or
remain the same.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that’s, that’s a really good place to
be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, if I look at
the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut—two cuts
this year—fairly evenly split between the two.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I wonder if you could explain a little
more the nuances or the differences there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Would two or three more inflation readings like the
one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk
to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their
Summary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and
everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a
range of plausible outcomes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”—
you know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re so close for me.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These are
very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as, I think,
you’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or
two.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I
think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No one—no one brings
to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular
rate path.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their
own reaction function.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I
Page 6 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t hold it with high confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think if you’re looking for—and, and don’t really
think that they’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “this is what I think is the right
thing.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try
to—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think in terms of what
we need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I’m not going to be specific about
how many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s
going to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with
the balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
look at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Have we reached an appropriate level of
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see
really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which
is—which is another thing that could, could happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, again, we don’t see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I—we
do see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that
would warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And if I could quickly follow up—did, did you or any of your
colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation
numbers today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It just is, you
know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when
that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—
Page 7 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what we do is, we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We tell
them how to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and some people do; some people don’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Most, most people don’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, you
know—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can,
you know, reflect it in one day.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll
know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the initial CPI reading
and its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jonnelle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JONNELLE MARTE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you
noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So do you think that there
still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent,
or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that
many of those imbalances have eased?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind
of overheated two years ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance
between supply and demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, what have we seen?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen labor force supply come up
quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s ongoing, mostly
now through the immigration channel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor
force.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving
down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve seen job openings moving down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen wage increases moving from very,
Page 8 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
very high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We have seen
unemployment creep up now sixth-tenths over the course of, of a year or so very, very gradually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent
unemployment—historically low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and,
you know, that’s an important statistic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument
that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what we
see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor
market very carefully—and that’s what we see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see gradual cooling—gradual moving
toward better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that,
but we really don’t see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As a quick follow-up—the surveys that make up the jobs report
are, are showing different tales.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s been some divergence, especially, we saw, in the last
report that we got on Friday.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So how do you interpret that, and, and how does it change your
view on the labor market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You just
have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s why it always makes
sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one
report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the
household survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, I mean, we’re left
with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, the
overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of
Page 9 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployed people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The jobs–workers gap is still a significantly positive number—greater than
it was before the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, overall, we’re looking at what is still a very strong labor market
but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin, with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Back on the rates path:
The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March—that’s a period in
which the economic data flow hasn’t been that dramatic a shift.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How, how—can you provide
some color on what changed in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to, to
see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So the
inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, as I mentioned
earlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We had really, really good
inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the
confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might
take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we—there
are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so you
really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would
have been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, you get another—you
get data—different data today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll have to see where the data light the way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
we’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,
and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ll just
Page 10 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have to see what, what—what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the
outlook and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the Summary of Economic Projections, the long-run interest rate forecast moved
up a bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as
restrictive as we’ve previously expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, how should we interpret what that means
about how the Committee views its current policy setting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move
up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a
long-run concept.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And what it is
is the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and
price stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s—
it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today we’ve got a very specific economy
with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s—I, I don’t think that
the, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But,
honestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is
in the near term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because
I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their,
their pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now,
we, we can’t really know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,
but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving
Page 11 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
forces.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there’s a really good question about whether, whether those really have
changed or whether, instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a, a series of persistent but,
ultimately, temporary shocks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s been the debate, and we can’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in the meantime,
we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I
also—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of
“How restrictive is policy?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question of whether it’s
sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think for the reasons I’ve
talked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear
that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider, with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Just
to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of
tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to
market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you
weren’t quite there yet?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I think this is about,
you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on
inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Is the labor market still strong?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s
what we’re thinking about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language
you’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability,
and another goal, which is maximum employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How are we doing there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think we’ve
got a good, strong labor market still.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think we’ve been making progress toward the price-
Page 12 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then for a while, there was a pause.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we look at today’s thing, and we
think, “Well, that’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, in the
meantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think we think, “Yes, it’s
about right.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting
the things that we would want to get, broadly speaking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s why we’ve been at this
policy rate now for almost a year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so just to follow up on that—I think one, one curious
thing here is, you’ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the
major things for all of this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve got growth that stays above long-run potential
throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long-run estimate—
right?—of 4.2.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So this isn’t a story of slack improving inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So where’s the improvement in
inflation coming from that it’s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from—
let’s start with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just
the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and
demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by
restrictive monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So those two things have been working together.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve also had a
very positive supply shock on the labor side.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply
shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’ve had, you
know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of
inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest
of this year brinks—brings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I mean,
ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and we don’t know that,
Page 13 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, look at today’s report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, if we see more like that—you know, we
don’t—we can’t know what the future holds.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in the meantime, we’ve made pretty good
progress on inflation with our current stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The base
case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but
your growth forecast doesn’t see any slowdown in the rest of the year, nor does the
unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And your inflation
forecasts basically average out to no change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if, at the end of the year, there is no change
from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What, what would be the point
for a rate cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think,
ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real
weakening in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise
rates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not to eliminate the
possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the
Committee does.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what
we’ve been getting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at
a—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, ultimately, we think rates will have
to come down to continue to support that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, so far, they haven’t had to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know,
that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t really see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We kind
of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the
Page 14 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
labor market while we’re continuing to make progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re getting—we’re
getting good results here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, to follow up: Is there any kind of concern for the housing
industry or financial stability—banks—in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean,
ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we
can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There will still be a
national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There will still be one, but the
distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in
terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We had the turmoil earlier
last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up
their capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the banking system, you
know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I was
wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see
inflationary pressure in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance,
and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You’re seeing, you know, anecdotal
stories of, the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald’s
announcing a $5 meal deal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but
Page 15 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy—and wonder if you
could tell us more about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have
come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know—and I
think you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on
goods, which is kind of hard to understand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some
signal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re seeing—you’re
continuing to see high readings there to some extent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation
from earlier pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, I mean, overall, you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflationary pressures have come
down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wages are still running,
you know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and
trend productivity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we haven’t
thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But at the same time,
getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which
is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>There’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected
this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do
to the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end
of the year or even two?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think if, you know—if you look back in 5 or 10 years and, and try
to pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of one 25 basis point rate cut, you’d, you’d have
quite a job on your hands.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s not how we look at it—you know, really, the whole rate
path matters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen
policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the
market will price in what it prices in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t—I have no way of saying—we’re, we’re not at that
stage, so I don’t know what we’ll be thinking about at that time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s a consequential
decision for the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we, we have the ability to, you know, approach this
question carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we will approach it carefully while we’re very much keeping an eye on,
you know, downside economic risks, should they—should they emerge.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you’ve been talking about this clear sense that it’s just going to
take longer to have the confidence that’s needed for rate cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there something about what
happened in the first couple of months of the year that you’re seeing differently now with more
time or hindsight?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting
that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the
parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So—but we had a
quarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we
shouldn’t have taken signal from.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it is what it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, you, you have to—you know,
low inflation is low inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to
take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the
signal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that
Page 17 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s what we said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that was
the right thing to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I still think that’s the right thing to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Now we have today’s inflation
reading, which is very different—very much more positive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to have to see what the
trend is—what’s, what’s going to be the data going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re looking for something that
gives us confidence that inflation is, is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And readings like
today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it
just—it’s only one reading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any
single data point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jo Ling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JO LING KENT.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m Jo Ling
Kent, with CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging
economic data but don’t feel good about this economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, you know—I, I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer
why people are, are not as happy about the economy as they might be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t tell people
how they should think or feel about the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not our job.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—you know, people
experience what they experience.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is,
we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve got a very strong labor market with
unemployment at 4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of
time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We had a period of high
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can
to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re confident that we’ll get there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful
for, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high
Page 18 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is people who—lower-income people—people who are at the margins of the
economy who, who have the worst experience—who experience the most pain from inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that
we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>As just a quick follow-up here—you’ve indicated one interest rate cut
sometime this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I know you don’t have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are
watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For everybody who’s
out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But what we
said is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back
down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So having that kind
of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,
to all Americans, for a long period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We had that period for a very long time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We very
much want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a
concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We were there for a long time, and
our goal is to get back to that place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in
the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CLAIRE JONES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m just drawing on the change in the
statement on there being “modest further progress” on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, halfway, you know,
through the year and after today’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee
members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just in terms of the
Page 19 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth,
clearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see
still-strong growth—solid growth this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s been very encouraging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If you go back a
year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a
recession—many forecasters had that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s not what happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Instead, we—the U.S. is,
anyway, and it’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the
world.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s been encouraging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say that the, the—today’s inflation report is
encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You asked about—your second question was really about shelter inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think if
you go back a couple of years—we, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you
know, people who own their houses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we have OER, which is owners’ equivalent rent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the—of the—when the
economy reopened, they really went up sharply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those play into rollover rents much more
slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and so what we—so we, we’ve
found now that there are big lags.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in,
in market rents.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has to get worked off, and that may take, you know, several years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain—are going at—up at relatively low levels—and
they still are—you know, this, this is just going to happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It just is going to happen more slowly
than we thought.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to, to owned
homes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—you know, many countries around the world do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some do it differently
Page 20 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
than us.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s something that the—you know, that the, the price experts have regularly looked at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is not something that we’re the only country that does, and it’s not something we’re looking at
changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it—it’s true.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s one of the
very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services
that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they’re actually living in it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And some countries—you should just ignore that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But that’s not our—that’s not how we do
inflation here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we do it the way we do it, and we’ve been very transparent about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
you know, it’s true that we’re—we’re seeing delays in, in realizing what—what’s happening
economically.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we understand that—you know, we understand that very well.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for taking
the question, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The last jobs report
showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s up 8.2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And since January of 2021, we’ve seen prices rise 19 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So people are using their credit
cards to pay for their lifestyle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy
could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income
during big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is
people spending more on their credit cards.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That—that has been happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Credit card
balances have been going up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Credit card defaults have been going up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re not at high
levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They couldn’t spend money.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But households
Page 21 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
were in very, very strong—historically strong—financial shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’ve now worked off a lot
of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re, we’re watching that carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, what do we see?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what
we see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household
sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of
shape it was in a year or two ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So how close then are we to that point where the consumer
can’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can’t hire like they’re hiring?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So consumer spending is still growing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s not growing at the pace it
was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, by the way,
other parts of the economy are picking up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has
picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—
you know, tech plants.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know—
something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for
the U.S. economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, no, you’re, you’re right, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we do see the same thing other
people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower-income
people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is, is to foster a very strong jobs economy,
which we think we have done—ultimately to get inflation under control, because those people
experience inflation, you know, very directly—very painfully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and, you know, once, once
we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which, which will also improve things.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You’ve mentioned that
unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I was just
wondering—can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it more of, like, a
Page 22 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quicker pace of people losing jobs?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to
start to go above 4.2 or something like that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How are you thinking about what you’re looking
for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is
more than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’ll be looking at everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the
ability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So waiting for that to happen is,
is not what we’re doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance
of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all
of it—the whole situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy
could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I, you know, I would just—
you know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And if we saw troubling—weakening
more than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
we’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So something like negative payroll numbers would be—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not going to—yeah, I mean, I, I can think of things that would—
many things would make it on that list, but I don’t think I’ll, I’ll utter them here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>May I ask—you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE [inflation] readings earlier
this year, that it wasn’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more
cautious in the rate outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be
quite good for PCE [inflation], as it was for CPI—does that imply that kind of two more good
Page 23 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
months would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently
project?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I, I don’t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in,
in my thinking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I get that, you know—as many good ones as we had bad ones—but it’s not
like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s the whole.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s going to be the totality of the data—[including] labor market data,
the growth data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that
builds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I don’t want
to try to give you specific numbers of things, because that points to dates, and I, I just don’t
think—we’re not at a point of being able to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kosuke.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KOSUKE TAKAMI.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for doing this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I am Kosuke Takami, with Nikkei.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in—Japan and some
emerging markets are suffering from the strong dollar.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I want to know if it is having a
positive impact on U.S. economy in total?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the
Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing
things about the level of the dollar.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So for us, it’s just another financial variable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you’re
right—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last
year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t think of it as benefiting or hurting
the U.S. We don’t—again, we don’t manage the level of the dollar.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s not our—
that’s not our job.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know—and for, for our economy, what, you know, we’re trying
Page 24 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to foster is maximum employment and price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we feel like we’ve made good
progress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger, with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re
forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re at 2.8 percent, of course,
on core PCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to
2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You also indicated the
job market has mostly normalized.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So why not cut rates this summer just once—you’re well
above neutral—to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest
for confidence for inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks
here, let me just say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of
economic activity, of employment, of the expansion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We understand that if we move too, too
quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over,
and it could be very disruptive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and
just basically trying to manage them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t
think it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is
moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s—that’s kind of been our test.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s our—that’s our
dual mandate there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we, we have a strong economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve got growth—all
forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our
Page 25 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Unemployment is still
low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully, and that’s, that’s what
we’re doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to follow, Chair Powell—do you need to be
ahead of a weakening in the labor market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Otherwise, is it too late, given that the labor market is
a lagging indicator—right?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s,
that’s not what we’re—that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework,
and we think we’re doing that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EVAN RYSER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Evan Ryser with Market News International.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Who will lead it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Will
you be—will it be you or a member—a Committee group of your—of your peers?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What will be
the parameters?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going
forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we—what, what we’ve been thinking is that we would announce
and commence the review later or late in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the meantime, as that time approaches, we
will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Within scope would
certainly be communications generally.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that
particular thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get
Page 26 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prematurely into a conversation until it’s really time to have it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, you know, I’m going to
leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Go to Nancy, for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer, with
Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just one more question on housing—can you still cut rates with shelter prices high,
or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable, like housing
prices moderating, that would really decide or decide against what we’re doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve got an
overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a
sustainable basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s our overall test.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the
labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So those are—those are two different tests.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say, you know, we’re not—
we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “That’s the one.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t
target housing prices, for example.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t target wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We, we target aggregate prices
and overall employment, so—
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow
down the pace of rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think you’d look at the over—we’d be looking at the aggregate
numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What’s going on here with inflation in the—at the
aggregate level?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know—and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing
inflation would, would matter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter,
too, but I wouldn’t single out housing as having a, a special role there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much.</div>
