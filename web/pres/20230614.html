Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 14, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is the responsibility of the
Federal Reserve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In particular,
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions
that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from
credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as
likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that
economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Although growth in consumer
spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting
higher mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be
weighing on business fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Committee participants generally expect subdued
Page 1 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
growth to continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real
GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of
the longer-run normal growth rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market remains very tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, payroll job gains
averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate moved up but remained low
in May at 3.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has shown signs of
easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>While the jobs-to-workers gap has
declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>FOMC
participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance
over time, easing upward pressures on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median unemployment rate projection in
the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the 12 months ending
in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In May, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation
has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue
to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next
year, and 2.1 percent in 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised
in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and price—and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage
points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It will take time,
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The extent of
these effects remains uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which
monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>As I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be
appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But at this meeting,
considering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range
steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary
Page 3 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
and economic and financial developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path
for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario
going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the
appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent
at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For the end of this year, the median
projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I hasten to add, as
always, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the economy does not
evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our
2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Reducing
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum
employment and stable prices over the longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I’m curious what
gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time
when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Interest rate–sensitive sectors like
housing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some
regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this
tightening cycle to address that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there
were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of
tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d
need to keep policy restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how
fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then last December,
after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point
hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to
our destination.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold
rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The main
issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may
be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the
ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It may make
sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was
only about this meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what
would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about
going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We really
were focused on what to do at this meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—
any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean,
of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But really, the focus was, was
on what to do today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been
made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I was just
wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s
been a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower
progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming
from?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not
coming from there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Demand’s not coming down all that fast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>According to GDP—you’ve
doubled your, your estimate of GDP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what’s the—what’s the narrative here?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It seems like
it’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent
with, but on the high side of, expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the
last SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved
up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Unemployment estimates
moved down a bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation estimates moved up a bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, all three of those kind of
point in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint
will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So although the level, frankly, is, is
pretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected]
federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but so we’ve kind
of gone back to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come
from?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting
inflation down is going to be a gradual one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s going to take some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I think you go
back to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think,
as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You start with goods.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>They’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will
say it’s not back to where it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And that should enable goods
prices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and you are seeing
there that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s really a matter
of time as that goes through the pipeline.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In fact, I think any forecast that people are making
right now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and
Page 7 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and
that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come
into] effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of
the—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we see only the earliest
signs of disinflation there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say [that,]
in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s the service
sector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And I think many analysts would say that the key to
getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which
we have seen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators
suggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We need to see that
continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation
down are, are coming into place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below
trend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would be a labor market that’s loosening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would be goods pipelines getting healthier
and healthier and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There, there—the things are in place that we need to see,
but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, what’s the
value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, not to be
flippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the
gym.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A majority of you
Page 8 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So why not just rip off the
Band-Aid and raise rates today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate
question from the question—from the—from, from that of level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and I think if you
look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our
individual estimates of how far to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last
year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far
away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common
sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every
meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if
only slightly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then there are benefits to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that gives us more information to make decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
may try to make better decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as
we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t
really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve
seen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll have
some more time to see that unfold.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this
right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that
the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I know you said July is live.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With only one June employment—with
only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July
meeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some
Page 9 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
bank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be
using to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since
the last meeting, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll
really be a three-month period of data that we can look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think that’s a full quarter, and I
think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six-
week period.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll look at those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll look at
what’s happening in the financial sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and
we’ll make a decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek, New York
Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down
the path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wonder, you
know, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient
and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And given that, you know, why do you feel
confident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or do you
think it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this
cycle?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following
the data and also the outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if
not all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s,
it’s just remarkable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s job

creation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s wages moving up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting
hiring.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so
it’s, it’s really the, the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these
meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s,
that’s how we do it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely
path of the economy is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there’s really no way to know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of
today, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
could wind up back in the same place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it really will be data driven.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I can’t—I can’t tell you
that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate
will be that far in advance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You had said back at
the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that still the
case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And also, could you give us
an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the—obviously, the current rate,
according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it 5.6?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it 6?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Where is
sufficiently restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the
balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero
now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved
much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means
by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under,
Page 11 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
underdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I still think, and my, my colleagues
agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we don’t—we don’t think we’re
there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you look at the—at the full
range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of
progress over the last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you
know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that
inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s what we want to see—
of course that’s what we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are
lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the
tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to
think that some of that may come into effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a
more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you
know, more—with more data over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering
when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would
expect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to
expect those lags to come into effect?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 12 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s
sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable
lags.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate
hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting
off—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of
where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where—
where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s
different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very,
very quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But broader demand, and
spending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you
know, then that makes it challenging, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re,
we’re looking at what’s happening in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re having to make these judgments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate
pace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I can’t point to
a specific data point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really
flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s
working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we
need to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 13 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing
on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart
from these lag effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what
that might mean.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
you know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what
would normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that
into account on, on—in, in making rate decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s how we think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned that
many of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>housing has come in
pretty low in the past couple of months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation
is now housing prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s
question: Why signal additional rate hikes?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why not simply give it even more time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the
dots, given what we’re seeing recently.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a
half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And forecasters, including Fed
forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know,
traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it
over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s running, and it’s running
Page 14 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know,
moving down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We want to see it moving down decisively.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re, you know, of
course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we don’t want to do—we,
we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we just don’t see that
yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by
the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with
which we’re moving.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Quick follow-up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, the last press conference you mentioned
you didn’t see wages driving inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there was some research from the San
Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you’ve talked about the
labor market today and the need for softening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how
you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,
but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early
2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People
were still at home.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on
goods.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent,
supply chains got all snarled up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So prices went way up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation went way up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that was
the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But as you—as
you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that
it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing
Page 15 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with
2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—
and that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a
few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You said
in the past that you don’t like to surprise markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets
should have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You also said a number of
times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You reiterated that again today and that
we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should
look at your reaction function.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What will you be reacting to—time or data?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In other words, if
nothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of
inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you
feel you need to?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal
in inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different
ways data might move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of
our way to surprise markets or the public.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting
the policy right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the
upcoming meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think you’ll, you’ll
see the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a—
make a judgment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down
based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or are we going to be in a
period where we’re not going to know what’s happening?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just
point you to the forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a
little higher than 4½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to
3.9 on a 12-month basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is by the end of this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline
for half a year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s the forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in
our reaction function.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s the
number-one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how I think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you talk about the balance
sheet and how you’re thinking about it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re
approaching reserve scarcity?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Also, are you
considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk
about that and then go back to the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So on that—of course, we’ve been very
focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The] Treasury has laid out its
borrowing plans publicly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the
Page 17 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid
market disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the
borrowings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills
the, the TGA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP
facility and also in reserves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will
be—which will be greater.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for
that matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over
the course of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make
adjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was there another part of your question?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take
some pressure off banks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility]
doesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s actually been
shrinking here lately.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a
lot over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s—I
think it’s a tool that we have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we want to use it, we can.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are other tools we can—we can use to address money
market issues.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near
term.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Have you seen sufficient
cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For example, how does the recent
rebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place,
really, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by
higher rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We now see housing
putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re watching that situation carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I do think we—we will see rents,
rents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I don’t see them
coming up quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level
now, and that’s appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I think we, we look at everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t just look at
housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices
all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely
forecasts—including their rate forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we
cumulate it, and then we publish it for you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how—that’s how they do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself
going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Because—assuming monetary
policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level
spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s really not my job.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—we hope and expect
that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t see
ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will say, and many of my
predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be
addressed over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would
be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve
financing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Under no circumstances.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Courtenay.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COURTENAY BROWN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So looking at
the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this
year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so should we take that as
a sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least
more—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I—I would just say it this way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I continue to think—and
this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent
without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve
Page 20 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seen in so many past instances.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that,
that gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I, I guess I want to
come back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We, we see—the Committee—
as you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation
down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is our
plan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in
the U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s
workers and families and businesses but also for the future.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Getting price stability back and, and
restored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it really is the bedrock
of the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and you should understand that that is our top priority.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just a quick follow-up on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I’m just a little confused
because you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but
when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate
is lower than where it is now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you help me understand that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with
the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year
out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But what they’re showing is that as inflation
comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually
going up, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out,
let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if—and actually, you know, since
we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be
meaningfully positive and significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So for us to get inflation down, that probably means—
that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is
Page 21 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming down really significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think,
as, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor
do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has not really moved
down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’re
going have to keep at it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Julie.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JULIE CHABANAS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Julie Chabanas, AFP
News Agency.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’
unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you
worried about that—about this rebound?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long-
standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a factor
that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But we do consider that when we’re
thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we do watch that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment,
has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re still
talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half-
century here in the United States.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three-
tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, still, it’s extraordinarily
low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Megan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent
question on housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We haven’t
Page 22 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we did hear Governor Waller talk
about how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or
a shorter bit of relief than we thought.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and
how that played into today’s outcome?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their
increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s important.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s part of
the overall picture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What you see is—
look at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re just not seeing a lot of
progress—not the kind of progress we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly,
so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be
3.9 percent this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the
course of the year, and that’s doing that again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts
are coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so
we’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and,
given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might
need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So wages will continue to increase.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we, you know—what
we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s
Page 23 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all,
all of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not
extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back
down but, but quite gradually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue
gradually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of
the income spectrum.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to
2 percent, which benefits everyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone
else.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GREG ROBB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you so much, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just
wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s
strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
mean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be
seeking higher wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that come up in your discussions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor
market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s, it’s
very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s half
of our mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we spend a lot of time talking about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think, you know, we—there,
there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we don’t spend a lot of time—
although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in
discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we—you know, we, we look,
and we see what’s going on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to
get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as I said, don’t think that was about—I
Page 24 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
didn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is
the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MARK HAMRICK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we’re about three months
past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with
commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And could you further elevate those risks
with higher still rates, possibly for longer?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m trying to think where to start.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll start with commercial real
estate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a substantial
amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A, a large part of it is in smaller banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take
losses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have
concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re well aware of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re monitoring it carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be
around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you
know, work its way into systemic risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you
know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where,
where issues really arose.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the
Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and
in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at
Page 25 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s really
our main focus.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully
monitoring that situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of
things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It might be hard for me to identify
something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re watching
those things very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with
credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able
to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we
can take that into account in our rate setting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I guess that’s what I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can I just follow up on the last part of that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you—do you risk
further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying
as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of
tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because
really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic
purposes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll, we’ll take that into account.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, we have responsibility for financial
stability as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much.</div>
