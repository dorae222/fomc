Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 14, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Price stability is the responsibility of the
Federal Reserve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In particular,
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions
that benefit all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from
credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as
likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that
economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Although growth in consumer
spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting
higher mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be
weighing on business fixed investment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Committee participants generally expect subdued

growth to continue.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real
GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of
the longer-run normal growth rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market remains very tight.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past three months, payroll job gains
averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate moved up but remained low
in May at 3.7 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming into better balance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth has shown signs of
easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">While the jobs-to-workers gap has
declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">FOMC
participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance
over time, easing upward pressures on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median unemployment rate projection in
the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the 12 months ending
in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In May, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation
has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue
to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next
year, and 2.1 percent in 2025.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy
prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised
in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and price—and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage
points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It will take time,
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The extent of
these effects remains uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which
monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be
appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But at this meeting,
considering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range
steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary
Page 3 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
and economic and financial developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path
for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario
going forward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the
appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent
at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For the end of this year, the median
projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I hasten to add, as
always, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If the economy does not
evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our
2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Reducing
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum
employment and stable prices over the longer run.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 4 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I look forward to your questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m curious what
gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time
when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Interest rate–sensitive sectors like
housing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some
regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this
tightening cycle to address that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there
were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of
tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d
need to keep policy restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how
fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then last December,
after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point
hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to
our destination.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold
rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The main
issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may
be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the
ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may make
sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was
only about this meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what
would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about
going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We really
were focused on what to do at this meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—
any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean,
of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But really, the focus was, was
on what to do today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been
made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I was just
wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s
been a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower
progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming
from?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not
coming from there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Demand’s not coming down all that fast.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">According to GDP—you’ve
doubled your, your estimate of GDP.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what’s the—what’s the narrative here?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It seems like
it’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 6 of 26

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent
with, but on the high side of, expectations.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the
last SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved
up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Unemployment estimates
moved down a bit.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation estimates moved up a bit.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, all three of those kind of
point in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint
will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So although the level, frankly, is, is
pretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected]
federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but so we’ve kind
of gone back to that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come
from?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting
inflation down is going to be a gradual one.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s going to take some time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I think you go
back to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think,
as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You start with goods.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">They’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will
say it’s not back to where it was.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s one thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And that should enable goods
prices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and you are seeing
there that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s really a matter
of time as that goes through the pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In fact, I think any forecast that people are making
right now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and
Page 7 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and
that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come
into] effect.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of
the—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we see only the earliest
signs of disinflation there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say [that,]
in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s the service
sector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And I think many analysts would say that the key to
getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which
we have seen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators
suggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We need to see that
continue.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation
down are, are coming into place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below
trend.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It would be a labor market that’s loosening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It would be goods pipelines getting healthier
and healthier and that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There, there—the things are in place that we need to see,
but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, what’s the
value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, not to be
flippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the
gym.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A majority of you
Page 8 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So why not just rip off the
Band-Aid and raise rates today?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate
question from the question—from the—from, from that of level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and I think if you
look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our
individual estimates of how far to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last
year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far
away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common
sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every
meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if
only slightly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then there are benefits to that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that gives us more information to make decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
may try to make better decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as
we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t
really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve
seen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll have
some more time to see that unfold.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this
right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that
the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I know you said July is live.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With only one June employment—with
only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July
meeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some

bank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be
using to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since
the last meeting, too.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll
really be a three-month period of data that we can look at.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think that’s a full quarter, and I
think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six-
week period.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll look at those things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll look at
what’s happening in the financial sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and
we’ll make a decision.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek, New York
Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down
the path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wonder, you
know, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient
and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And given that, you know, why do you feel
confident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or do you
think it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this
cycle?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following
the data and also the outlook.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if
not all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s,
it’s just remarkable.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s job

creation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s wages moving up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting
hiring.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so
it’s, it’s really the, the data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these
meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s,
that’s how we do it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely
path of the economy is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, there’s really no way to know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of
today, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
could wind up back in the same place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it really will be data driven.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I can’t—I can’t tell you
that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate
will be that far in advance.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You had said back at
the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that still the
case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And also, could you give us
an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is the—obviously, the current rate,
according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it 5.6?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it 6?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Where is
sufficiently restrictive?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the
balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero
now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved
much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means
by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under,
Page 11 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
underdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I still think, and my, my colleagues
agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we don’t—we don’t think we’re
there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if you look at the—at the full
range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of
progress over the last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you
know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that
inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s what we want to see—
of course that’s what we want to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are
lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the
tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to
think that some of that may come into effect.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a
more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you
know, more—with more data over time.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering
when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would
expect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to
expect those lags to come into effect?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 12 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s
sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable
lags.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate
hikes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting
off—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of
where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where—
where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s
different.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very,
very quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But broader demand, and
spending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on
that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you
know, then that makes it challenging, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re,
we’re looking at what’s happening in the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re having to make these judgments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate
pace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I can’t point to
a specific data point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really
flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s
working.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we
need to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 13 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing
on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart
from these lag effects.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what
that might mean.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
you know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what
would normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that
into account on, on—in, in making rate decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s how we think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Chris.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRIS RUGABER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned that
many of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">housing has come in
pretty low in the past couple of months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation
is now housing prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s
question: Why signal additional rate hikes?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why not simply give it even more time?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the
dots, given what we’re seeing recently.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a
half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And forecasters, including Fed
forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know,
traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it
over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s running, and it’s running
Page 14 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know,
moving down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We want to see it moving down decisively.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re, you know, of
course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we don’t want to do—we,
we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we just don’t see that
yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by
the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with
which we’re moving.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Quick follow-up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, the last press conference you mentioned
you didn’t see wages driving inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, there was some research from the San
Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you’ve talked about the
labor market today and the need for softening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how
you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,
but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early
2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People
were still at home.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on
goods.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent,
supply chains got all snarled up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So prices went way up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation went way up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that was
the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But as you—as
you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that
it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing
Page 15 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with
2 percent inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—
and that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a
few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Michael McKee.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You said
in the past that you don’t like to surprise markets.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets
should have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You also said a number of
times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You reiterated that again today and that
we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should
look at your reaction function.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What will you be reacting to—time or data?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In other words, if
nothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of
inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you
feel you need to?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal
in inflation?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different
ways data might move.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of
our way to surprise markets or the public.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting
the policy right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the
upcoming meetings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 16 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think you’ll, you’ll
see the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a—
make a judgment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down
based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or are we going to be in a
period where we’re not going to know what’s happening?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just
point you to the forecast.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a
little higher than 4½ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to
3.9 on a 12-month basis.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline
for half a year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s the forecast.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in
our reaction function.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s the
number-one thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how I think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Victoria.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">VICTORIA GUIDA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria Guida with Politico.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could you talk about the balance
sheet and how you’re thinking about it?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re
approaching reserve scarcity?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Also, are you
considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk
about that and then go back to the balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So on that—of course, we’ve been very
focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has. [</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The] Treasury has laid out its
borrowing plans publicly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the
Page 17 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid
market disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the
borrowings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills
the, the TGA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP
facility and also in reserves.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will
be—which will be greater.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for
that matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over
the course of the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make
adjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Was there another part of your question?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take
some pressure off banks?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility]
doesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s actually been
shrinking here lately.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a
lot over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s—I
think it’s a tool that we have.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If we want to use it, we can.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are other tools we can—we can use to address money
market issues.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near
term.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Have you seen sufficient
cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For example, how does the recent
rebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place,
really, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by
higher rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We now see housing
putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’re watching that situation carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I do think we—we will see rents,
rents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I don’t see them
coming up quickly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level
now, and that’s appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I think we, we look at everything.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t just look at
housing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices
all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely
forecasts—including their rate forecast.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we
cumulate it, and then we publish it for you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how—that’s how they do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself
going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Edward.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward
Lawrence with Fox Business.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I want to go back to comments you made about, in the past,
Page 19 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
about unsustainable fiscal path.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in
10 years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At what point do
you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Because—assuming monetary
policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level
spending.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s really not my job.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—we hope and expect
that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t see
ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will say, and many of my
predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be
addressed over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would
be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve
financing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Under no circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Courtenay.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COURTENAY BROWN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So looking at
the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this
year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so should we take that as
a sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least
more—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I—I would just say it this way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I continue to think—and
this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent
without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve
Page 20 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seen in so many past instances.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s possible.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that,
that gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I, I guess I want to
come back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We, we see—the Committee—
as you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation
down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is our
plan.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in
the U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s
workers and families and businesses but also for the future.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Getting price stability back and, and
restored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it really is the bedrock
of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and you should understand that that is our top priority.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just a quick follow-up on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m just a little confused
because you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but
when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate
is lower than where it is now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you help me understand that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with
the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year
out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But what they’re showing is that as inflation
comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually
going up, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out,
let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if—and actually, you know, since
we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be
meaningfully positive and significantly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So for us to get inflation down, that probably means—
that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is
Page 21 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
coming down really significantly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think,
as, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor
do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has not really moved
down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’re
going have to keep at it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Julie.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JULIE CHABANAS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Julie Chabanas, AFP
News Agency.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’
unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you
worried about that—about this rebound?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long-
standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a factor
that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But we do consider that when we’re
thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we do watch that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment,
has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re still
talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half-
century here in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three-
tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, still, it’s extraordinarily
low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Megan.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MEGAN CASSELLA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent
question on housing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We haven’t
Page 22 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we did hear Governor Waller talk
about how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or
a shorter bit of relief than we thought.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and
how that played into today’s outcome?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their
increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s important.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s part of
the overall picture.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What you see is—
look at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re just not seeing a lot of
progress—not the kind of progress we want to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly,
so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be
3.9 percent this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the
course of the year, and that’s doing that again.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts
are coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so
we’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and,
given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might
need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So wages will continue to increase.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, we, you know—what
we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s
Page 23 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all,
all of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not
extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back
down but, but quite gradually.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue
gradually.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of
the income spectrum.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to
2 percent, which benefits everyone.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone
else.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GREG ROBB.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you so much, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just
wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s
strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
mean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be
seeking higher wages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that come up in your discussions?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor
market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, it’s, it’s
very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s half
of our mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we spend a lot of time talking about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, you know, we—there,
there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we don’t spend a lot of time—
although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in
discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we—you know, we, we look,
and we see what’s going on.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to
get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And as I said, don’t think that was about—I
Page 24 of 26

June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
didn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is
the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with
commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And could you further elevate those risks
with higher still rates, possibly for longer?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m trying to think where to start.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll start with commercial real
estate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a substantial
amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A, a large part of it is in smaller banks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take
losses.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have
concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re well aware of that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re monitoring it carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be
around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you
know, work its way into systemic risk.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where,
where issues really arose.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the
Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and
in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at

the Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s really
our main focus.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully
monitoring that situation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of
things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It might be hard for me to identify
something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re watching
those things very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with
credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able
to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we
can take that into account in our rate setting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I guess that’s what I would say.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can I just follow up on the last part of that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you—do you risk
further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying
as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of
tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because
really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic
purposes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll, we’ll take that into account.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, we have responsibility for financial
stability as well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you very much.</span></p>
