Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 19, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved
closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We also made the technical decision to slow the pace of decline
in the size of our balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more to say about these decisions after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year,
with GDP rising at 2.3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Recent indications, however, point to a moderation in consumer
spending following the rapid growth seen over the second half of 2024.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Surveys of households
and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It remains to be
seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In our Summary of
Economic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year,
somewhat lower than projected in December, and to rise a bit below 2 percent over the next two
years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains averaged 200,000 per
month over the past three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains low and has
held in a narrow range for the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The jobs-to-workers gap has held steady for several
months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in
the pandemic recovery.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor
Page 1 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
market are broadly in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary
pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end
of this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Some
near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see this in both
market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are
mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of
longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The median
projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, a
little higher than projected in December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In 2027, the median projection is at our 2 percent
objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Looking
ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is the net effect of these
policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>While there
have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty
around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we parse the incoming
information, we’re focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As
Page 2 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the
target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving
outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,
and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward—an admittedly challenging exercise at this time in light of
considerable uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of next
year, unchanged from December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>While these individual forecasts are always subject to
uncertainty, as I noted, uncertainty today is unusually elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, these projections
are not a Committee plan or a decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy is not on a preset course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy
stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If
the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward
2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy
accordingly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties
that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At today’s meeting, we also decided to slow the pace of decline in our balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since we began balance sheet runoff, our securities holdings have declined by more than $2
trillion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>While market indicators continue to suggest that the quantity of reserves remains
abundant, we have seen some signs of increased tightness in money markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Beginning in
Page 3 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
April, the monthly cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $25 billion to $5 billion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run,
we are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This action has no implications for our
intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the
medium term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Committee also continued its discussions as part of our five-year review of our
monetary policy framework.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>At this meeting, we focused on labor market dynamics and our
maximum-employment goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we have indicated, our review will include outreach and public
events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a
research conference in May.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical
feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand
that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for your time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
two things on sort of the real side here, one inflation and then—and then GDP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How much of the
Page 4 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
higher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs, and since the policy path remains the same,
are you effectively reading this as a one-time price-level shock?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, so how much of it is, is tariffs?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say that it is going to
be very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs
and from, from other—and that’s already the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You may have seen that goods inflation
moved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Trying to track that back to
actual tariff increases, given what was tariffed and what was not—very, very challenging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
some of it—the, the answer is clearly some of it—a good part of it is, is coming from tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
we’ll be—we’ll be working, and so will other forecasters, to try to find the best possible way to
separate nontariff inflation from tariff inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of the, the—your, your sort of looking-through question, too soon to say about
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As, as I’ve mentioned, it, it can be the case that it’s appropriate sometimes to look through
inflation if it’s going to go away quickly without action by, by us, if it’s transitory.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that can
be the case in the case of, of tariff inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that would depend on the, the tariff inflation
moving through fairly quickly and would depend critically, as well, on inflation expectations
being well anchored—longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I, I guess I’m looking at the obvious here—the fact that
the policy path doesn’t change at all and inflation is unchanged in the outyears also.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Doesn’t that
imply you all have basically decided that there is no signal here and that it’s just going to—we’re
back to “transitory” again?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think—I think that’s kind of the base case, but, as I said, it’s—
we really can’t know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to have to see how things actually, actually work out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the fact that there wasn’t much change—I think that’s, that’s partly because, you know, you
Page 5 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see—you see weaker growth but higher inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They kind of offset.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And also, frankly, a little
bit of inertia when it—when it comes to changing something in this highly uncertain
environment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you’re—you, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you
just say, “Maybe I’ll stay where I am.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You just
described inflation expectations as well anchored, but has your confidence in that assessment
changed at all, given the increase in certain measures and the high degree of uncertainty
expressed by businesses, households, and forecasters?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So our inflation expectations—of course, we do monitor inflation
expectations very, very carefully—basically, every source we can find, and, you know—short-
term, long-term, households, businesses, forecasters, market-based.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think the picture,
broadly, is this: You do see increases widely in short-term inflation expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And people
who fill out surveys and answer, you know, questionnaires are pointing to tariffs about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If
you look—in the survey world, if you look a little further out, you, you really—you really don’t
see much in the way of an increased longer-term inflation—inflation expectations are mostly
well anchored, if you look at the [series maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of] New York,
for example.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then you have market based, and it’s the same pattern.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, people and
markets are pricing in and, and breakevens, some higher inflation over the next year must be
related to tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know from the surveys.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if you look out five years or five-year, five-
year forward, you’ll see that breakevens have—are either flat or, actually, slightly down in the
case of a longer-term one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So we look at that, and we will be watching all of it very, very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do not take
anything for granted.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s at the very heart of our framework: anchored inflation
expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what—that’s what you see right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and how much weight do you put on the deterioration in
consumer confidence surveys?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You said recently that this is perhaps not the best indication of
future spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I’m curious, you know, what you think is behind this deterioration and, and
to what extent it could be a leading indicator for hard data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let’s start with the hard data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we do see pretty
solid hard data still.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So growth looks like it’s maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending
moderating a bit, but still at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Unemployment’s 4.1 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job creation, most
recently, has been at a healthy level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has started to move up now, we think partly in
response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that’s the hard data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, it’s a solid picture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The, the survey data, [in the case of] both
household and businesses, show significant rise in uncertainty and significant concerns about
downside risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So how do we think about that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—that is the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned the other day, as you pointed out, the relationship between survey data
and actual economic activity hasn’t been very tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There have been plenty of times where
people are saying very down—downbeat things about the economy and then going out and
buying a new car.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we don’t know that that will be the case here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will be watching very
carefully for signs of weakness in the real data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course we will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I, I—you know, given
where we are, we think our policy’s in a good place to react to, to what comes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think
that the right thing to do is, is to wait here for, you know, for greater clarity about, about what,
what the economy’s doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 7 of 28

MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Chair Powell, Chair
Greenspan once defined price stability as, as an environment in which inflation is so low and
stable over time that it doesn’t materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Can
you say that today we have that price stability—that households and businesses are ignoring
price growth, or do you see, by an advanced psychology, big changes in inventories and surveys
that show consumers, at least in the short run, expect higher inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I do like that definition a lot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In fact, I used it at the recent
conference where I spoke.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think a world where, where people can make their daily
economic decisions, and businesses, and they’re not having to think about the possibility of
significantly high inflation—we know inflation will bounce around.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That’s, that is price
stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say we were at
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation was running around 2½ percent for some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I do think with the arrival of, of
the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed, if the SEP doesn’t really show further
downward progress on inflation this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that, that’s really due to the tariffs coming in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, delayed, but if you look at our forecast, we do see ourselves getting back into the low 2s in
’26 and then down to 2 [percent] by ’27—of course, highly uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I see progress having,
having been made toward that, and then progress in the future.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that progress is probably
delayed for the time being.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If that’s the case, why are there cuts in the SEP for 2025?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, again, people wrote down two cuts the last time, and they look
at—they look at the—you know, the—and they wrote down, you know, meaningful decline in
growth out from 2.1 to 1.7 in 2025, a tick up in the unemployment rate, so not much there, but
Page 8 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
core inflation up by three-tenths.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so those two kind of—those kind of balance each other
out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So people—not everybody, but, on balance, people wrote down similar numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
changes aren’t that big.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The other—the other factor, though, as I mentioned, is just really high uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What
would you write down?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s just—it’s really hard to know how this is going to work out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, we think our policy’s in a good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think it’s a good place where we can
move in the direction that—where we need to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in the meantime, we, we—it’s, it’s really
appropriate to wait for further clarity, and, of course, you know, the costs of doing that, given
that the economy is still solid, are very low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So with near 4 percent unemployment rate, that should be low enough to bring people
in from the sidelines in terms of hiring.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re seeing the hiring rates have been stuck at
2023, 2024 levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, what’s going on there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, so that’s a feature of the—has been for some time, a feature of
this labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You have pretty high participation, accounting for aging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You’ve got wages
that are consistent with 2 percent inflation, assuming that we’re going to keep getting, you know,
relatively high productivity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve got unemployment, you know, pretty close to its natural
level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But job—the hiring rate is quite low, but so is the layoff rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the, the—you look at
initial claims or layoffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re not seeing people losing their jobs, but you’re seeing that
people who don’t have a job having to wait longer and longer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, the question is,
which way does that break?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we were to see a meaningful increase in layoffs, then that would
probably translate fairly quickly into unemployment, because people are—you know, it’s, it’s
Page 9 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a—it’s not a big hiring market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve been watching that, and it’s just not in the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
hasn’t happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What we’ve had is, is a low-firing, low-hiring situation, and it seems to be in
balance now for, you know, for the last six, seven, eight months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s where we are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s
healthy levels of job creation, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, overall, it’s a labor market that’s in balance, and, you
know, we, we watch it very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So then, have we seen the Administration—the new
Administration’s policies in the economic numbers yet?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And when do you anticipate that
happening?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In labor?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or in, in other—?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In labor and inflation, just across the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Have we
started to see the new policies take effect in the numbers?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, you know, only in a—kind of an early way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s only been
a few months, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, for example, the, the layoffs that are happening here are, you
know, they’re certainly meaningful to the people involved, and they may be meaningful to a
particular neighborhood or region or area, but at the national level, they’re not—they’re not
significant yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know what—where that—how far that will go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll, we’ll find out much more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mentioned that—you, you saw it—we’ve had two, two very strong goods inflation
readings in the last two months, which is very unexpected, and, I think, hard to trace it to specific
tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it must have—it must have something to do with—it’s either noise and it’ll come
back, and that—that’s very possible, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if it is persistent, then it must be to do with, you
know, people buying ahead of tariffs, or raising prices ahead of tariffs, and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That—those kinds of things happen, and they’re very, very hard to capture because so much of it
Page 10 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is indirect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>A great example is there—washing machines were tariffed in the last, last round of
tariffs, and prices went up, but prices also went up on, on dryers, which were not tariffed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the
manufacturers just, you know, they just kind of followed the crowd and, and raised it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So things
happen very indirectly, and so there’ll be a lot of work done in the coming months to, to try to
trace all that through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, ultimately, though, it’s too soon to be seeing significant effects in
economic data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Craig.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CRAIG TORRES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
said transitory price increases from tariffs are the base case—transitory is the base case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wasn’t
it the base case last time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And didn’t the FOMC forecast lower inflation ahead last time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
wasn’t the lesson that it quickly got into services, haircuts, daycare, everything else?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I’m
just wondering why the nine aren’t taking that on board and are cutting twice this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When you say “last time,” are you talking about the last—
CRAIG TORRES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Pandemic, yes—during the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You could have been talking about the last time there were tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In which case, the inflation was, was transitory.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No—of course, we’re well aware of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know,
it’s, it’s still the truth, if, if there’s an inflationary impulse that’s going to go away on its own, it’s
not the right policy to, to tighten policy, because by the time you have your effect, you’re—you
know, you’re—an effect that by—by design, you are lowering economic activity and
employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if that’s not necessary, you don’t want to do it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In real time, as we know, it’s
Page 11 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
hard to make that judgment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and, and we’re well aware, you know, of what happened,
obviously, with, with the pandemic inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, I mean, we have to look at this as a—as a
different situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s, there are differences and similarities.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s a different time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, we haven’t had real price stability fully reestablished yet, and we have to keep that in
mind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know, we also have—we hear that people are very reluctant to take on—to, you
know, to, to allow prices to go up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time, we hear that businesses are intending to
pass many of these prices through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s hard to say how this is going to work out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve, Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking my question,
Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Bank of Canada in its last policy statement said, “Monetary policy cannot
offset the impacts of a trade war.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What it can and must do is ensure that higher prices do not
lead to ongoing inflation.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I wonder if that kind of reflects your own sense of prioritization,
faced with higher prices and weaker growth—that the idea is, you have to take care of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know—so we, we have two goals, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We have maximum
employment and price stability, and we have to balance those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there can be
situations in which they are in tension, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we have, actually have a provision in our—in
our consensus statement that says what we should do in that case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a very challenging, you
know, situation for, for any central bank, and certainly for us.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, what we say that we’ll do
is, we’ll, we’ll look how far each of those two goals is—each of those two measures is from its
goal, and then we’ll ask how long we think it might take to get back to the goal for each of them,
and we’ll make a judgment, because our, you know, our tools work in one direction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re
either tightening or loosening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s a very challenging situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let me say, we don’t have
that situation right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not what the—that’s not where the economy is at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also
Page 12 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not where the forecast is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t know any mainstream forecast that really shows significant
problems like that, so—
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, just to follow up, yesterday the UCLA Anderson Forecast said
there’s—a high probability of a recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Where, where do you stand on whether or not the
slowdown you’re seeing creates a higher probability or concern that you may have on recession?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, there’s always an unconditional probability—possibility
of, of a recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It might be broadly in the range of one in four at any time, if you look back
through, through the years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It—there could be, within 12 months, a one in four chance of a
recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the question is, is whether that—whether this current situation, those possibilities
are elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will say this: We don’t—we don’t make such a forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at outside
forecasts, forecasters have, have generally raised—a number of them have raised their possibility
of a—of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate levels—you know, still in the
region of, of the traditional, because they were extremely low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you go back two months,
people were saying that the, the likelihood of a recession was extremely low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, has moved up,
but it’s not high.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As
you know, I guess, last night the—President Trump fired two members of the Federal Trade
Commission, an independent agency, and this could cause the kind of legal fight about the
Administration’s power to fire independent people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If those firings stand, is that a threat to the
Fed’s independence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could he do the same thing to the Fed Board?</div>

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think I, I did answer that question in this very room some time
ago, and I, I [have] no desire to change that answer and have nothing new for you on that today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I just—okay, well, maybe I’ll have another
mulligan. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Laughter] As you know, I, I wanted to go back to the consumer sentiment,
particularly the inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the summer of
2022, you cited the rise in the long-term inflation expectations in that index as the reason that
you went big with a three-quarter-point hike.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I know you’ve—I mean, you’ve talked about
all the different measures now, but you seem to not be placing the same weight on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so
I’m just wondering, are you dismissing that, what we saw last week from the University of
Michigan, or does that carry the same weight as it did in the past?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I mentioned it back then, but in no way did I place a huge
weight on it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it, it—that was an ex post story, but it wasn’t the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That was a
preliminary reading, and so is this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s also—this is—that, that Michigan, the one you’re
referring to, the longer-term thing—you know, we look at it, and we don’t dismiss data that we
don’t like.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we force ourselves to look at it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it is an outlier compared to market-based
and compared to other survey-based assessments of longer-run inflation expectations, so we’ve
got to keep that in mind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I—again, I, I would just say, we look at—we look at all of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that one—that one’s kind of an outlier, but, you know, nonetheless, we, we take notice of it.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There is a
worry on Wall Street that when you say you want to study the net effect of the fiscal policies, we
may see on the economy that you would end up waiting too long and be “behind the curve” in

responding to any downturn.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How can you reassure people that you can spot a problem early
enough, unless you decide to be preemptive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, look, we’re, we’re aware of the—we’re well aware of how
things are going to evolve and the time frames and all that, and, you know, we will—we will use
our tools to foster achievement of our goals to the—to the best we can.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, we’re
going to try to be timely with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For right now, the hard data are pretty solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we are
obviously aware of the soft sentiment data and high uncertainty, and we’re watching that
carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think it’s a, a good time for us to wait for further clarity before we consider
adjusting our, our policy stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you think it’s going to be hard to get clarity in a “government
by tweet”?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, do you have a, a feeling that at some point you actually will have a forecast
you can trust?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yes, I think we will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just—it’s hard to say when that will be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
know, we’re—these decisions are going to be made, and they’re going to be implemented, and
then we’ll know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At that point, we’ll know what the decisions are, and we’ll have to make
assessments then about their, their implications for the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those things will happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A
lot of them will happen over the course of, you know, in coming months, certainly over the
course of this year, and we’ll be adapting as we go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank
you for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the beginning, you were talking about separating the signal
from the noise, and tariff inflation from nontariff inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you “walk us through” what that
Page 15 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
looked like over the last couple of months—if there were specifics, from the January meeting to
now, that helped you make those distinctions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when we say “separating the signal from the noise,” that’s just a
way of saying that things are highly uncertain and that, you know, you’re reading about
developments—the news is full of developments of tariffs being put on and taken off and things
like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s—some of that is noise in the sense that it’s, it’s not really telling you anything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re trying to extract a signal from that, and the signal is what’s going to be the effect on
economic activity, on inflation, on employment, and all those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so that’s really when
we say “signal and noise.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, the second thing was—?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or, similarly for tariff inflation, nontariff inflation, ways that you’re
making the distinction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s sort of a, a special case of that—of, you know, with the
idea being—and I think—do think that the first two months of this year are a great example.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve got high readings for goods inflation after a string of readings that averaged close to
zero, and you have to ask—it’s coming during tariffs, but, you know, you—it’s very hard to,
actually, scientifically go back and match up those increases and say, “Yes, I can prove that
that’s from tariffs.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it kind of has to be, to some extent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Plus, noise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There can be
idiosyncratic readings in various categories, which will shortly reverse, and that, that happens,
too, and that could be a big piece of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I think we’ll know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In a couple of months,
we’ll know whether those were—you know, where that really was from.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s a—that’s
another case where I think it’s going to be very, very challenging to unpack the inflation that we
see over the course of this year and be able to say with confidence how much of that came from
Page 16 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation and how much of it—sorry, from tariffs—and how much of it didn’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s what
we’ll be doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be doing that, and so will everybody else, and we’ll all be trying very hard
to, to make that assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I, I’m sure we will make a lot of progress on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we already have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it, it’s going to be a challenge.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you have a sense yet as to what, in your mind, what makes
something cross from noise to a signal—what that threshold would look like?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it would depend on what we’re talking about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean,
obviously, you’re looking for direct evidence that, that particular pieces of, of inflation are, are—
or are clearly not—caused by tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For example, something that was, you know, in the service
sector that was far away from anything that’s tariffed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You, you might think, okay, well that is—
like, frankly, housing services inflation—which, which, by the way, has been behaving well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know—which, for, for some time, was kind of our problem.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now it’s been—it’s slow, but
it’s definitely, you know, moving down in a—in a very good way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s more now with goods
and, to some extent, with, with nonhousing services inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kelly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KELLY O’GRADY.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kelly O’Grady,
CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So consumer sentiment has dipped dramatically, but you say the economy and the
hard data is still solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is your message to consumers that clearly disagree and don’t feel
that strength?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Because the hard data they’re looking at is their grocery bill.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, so a couple things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The grocery bill is about, about past
inflation, really.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There was inflation in ’21, ’22, and ’23, and prices went up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The current
level—it’s not the change in prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s, they’re unhappy—and, and they’re not wrong to be
unhappy—that prices went up quite a bit, and they’re paying a lot for those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s—I
Page 17 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think that is the fundamental fact and has been for a long time—a couple years—why people are
unhappy with the—with the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not that the economy’s not growing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s not that
inflation’s really high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s not that unemployment is high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s none of those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have,
you know, 4.1 percent unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve got 2 percent growth, and, you know, it’s, it’s a
pretty good economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But people are unhappy because of the price level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and I do—we
completely understand and accept that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to follow up: Why are you still projecting two rate cuts
this year if your own projections show inflation higher for longer?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Does that mean you see a
slowdown in economic growth as a real threat?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think if you—yeah, I mean, remember, we came into this
with—at the December meeting, and the median was two cuts, the median was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And so you
come in, and you see, broadly speaking, weaker growth but higher inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they kind of
balance each other out, so you think—and, and unemployment is really, really only, only a one-
tenth change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s—there’s just not a big change in the forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There really isn’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Modest,
you know, meaningfully higher growth and meaningfully higher inflation, which call for
different responses, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So they cancel each other out, and people just said, “Okay, I’m going
to stay here.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the second factor is, it’s so highly uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is just—you know, we’re sitting here
thinking—and we, we obviously are in, in touch with businesses and households all over the
country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have an extraordinary network of contacts that come in through the Reserve Banks
and put it in the Beige Book—and also through contacts at the Board.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we get all that, and
we, we do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not
yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’re watching carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would tell people that the economy seems to be—
Page 18 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seems to be healthy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that, that sentiment is, is quite negative at this time, and that
probably has to do with, you know, turmoil at the beginning of an Administration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s making,
you know, big changes in, in areas of policy, and that’s probably part of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I do think the
underlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more—is more about the
price level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask, first of all, if
you could clarify.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You were talking about how tariffs were a good part of the uptick in the
inflation forecasts, and I was just wondering what that specifically refers to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that the tariffs
that have already been put in place?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that anticipating some of the tariffs that might be coming
on April 2?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then also, if you wouldn’t mind talking a little more about the balance sheet
decision and what drove that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Did that have anything to do with expectations of how the debt
ceiling—raising the debt ceiling might affect the reserve supply?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Yeah, so, in the SEP, you’ll see that there’s not further progress on
core inflation this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re kind of side flatlining, going sideways.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t ask people to
say—to write down how much of this is from tariffs and how much of it is not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But some of it is
from tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that tariffs are coming, and we know that they’re probably already—all,
all forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core PCE inflation [and] core CPI inflation this year,
without exception.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not aware of an exception.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s in there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I can’t tell you how much of
that it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of the balance sheet—so, yeah, we—I think—I guess the way I’d say it is, you
know, it was the flows in and out of the, the TGA that got us thinking about it, but as we, you
know, as we thought about it, we really came to the view that this was a good time to, to make
Page 19 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the move that we made.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, broadly, Committee came around—came around to the view that
we, we would do the same thing we’d already done, which is, once we—I guess in June, we—
was it June?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Whenever it was, we, we lowered the pace of QT, and we’re just going to do that
again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to cut it roughly in half.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the sense of that is, if you’re cutting the pace
of QT roughly in half, then the runway is probably doubled, okay?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s going—it’s going to
be slower for longer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And people really liked that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People thought, “That’s, that’s a good idea.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s like a plane.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can think of it like a plane coming in for a landing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we get
closer and we—by the way, we still think that reserves are abundant, although you begin to see
some of the—some of the things we look at begin to react a little bit, but we still think that
they’re abundant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, now, the TGA is emptying out, so reserves are, are higher
now, so you can’t really see the underlying signal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we came around to the view, and, and it
had a lot of appeal, and so we did it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It really—it has no implications at all for monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has no implications at all for the ultimate size of the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It isn’t sending a signal in
any hidden way that you can try to tease out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just not there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, we’re basically—it’s
very consistent with our plans and our practices that we’ve published and that we’ve followed
since we began this—what is a very successful, you know, rundown of the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again,
[this is] the second time that we’ve slowed the pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ve said that we would stop when
we were somewhat above the level [of reserves] we judge as ample.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, clearly, we’re not at
that level yet, but we’re going to be approaching it more slowly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a commonsense kind of a—
kind of a thing, and it had—it had pretty broad appeal, I will say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CLAIRE JONES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You said in January, Chair Powell,
that inflation expectations remained well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you still say they remain well
Page 20 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
anchored today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to reiterate the question others have asked, if they’re not so well
anchored, why hasn’t there been a more radical shift to the policy path today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when we—when we talk about inflation expectations being well
anchored, we’re talking about longer-run inflation expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they really haven’t moved
much, I mean, if at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There, there’s one reading that everyone’s focusing on that’s higher, but
the other survey readings and the market-based readings all show relatively, you know, well-
anchored inflation expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You would expect that expectations of inflation over the course
of a year would move around, because conditions change, and in this case, we have tariffs
coming in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know how big, what’s—there’s so many things we don’t know, but we
kind of know there are going to be tariffs, and they tend to bring growth down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They tend to
bring inflation up at the—in the first instance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so I would say, you, you know, I’m not
dismissing what we’re seeing in short-term inflation expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, as I mentioned, follow
that very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But when we say expectations are well anchored, we’re really looking at,
you know, longer term, five year and out, and there’s really no story to tell five years and out,
either in market based or, or in surveys.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we keep—we’ll watch it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, we’re not, you
know, we’re, we’re not going to miss any evidence that longer-term or medium-term inflation
expectations are, are moving.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Treasury Secretary Bessent has
observed that a large share of job growth over the last couple of years has been in what he calls
government or government-adjacent sectors—health care, education.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you agree that there’s
some weakness in underlying private job growth, and do you see the composition of job growth
as something that has policy implications?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 21 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that has been the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We talked about that over the course
of the last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There were—there were some good number of months and times when a lot of
the job creation was, was concentrated in, you know, educational institutions, health care, state
governments, things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>There were also times when private-sector job growth has been
moving, moving in a healthy frame—and they’re all—they’re all jobs, but—and remember,
we’re, you know, we’re at very low unemployment for, you know, for, for quite a time now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
I, I think it’s a good labor market, but it’s—look, it’s something that we monitor carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>From
our standpoint, employment is employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But I, you know—the, the elected government is
entitled to have—you know, we, we don’t have policies that address different kinds of
employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, but the elected government has a—has a different role, and they can—they,
they can have those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Quick QT question: Does the Committee envision at some point
tapering the MBS runoff, runoff as well?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think tapering it—I, I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s no plan to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
know, at a certain point, we’ll stop runoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we may or may not stop MBS runoff, though,
because, you know, we can—we can—we, we want to stop runoff in net at some point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
haven’t made any decisions about that, but, you know, we, we want the—we want the MBS to
roll off our balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We really, strongly desire that, so—but we haven’t made any
decisions about that, you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we will—we—I think we’d, we’d look carefully at letting
that keep going, but hold the overall size of the balance sheet in, you know, constant, at some
point—a point that we’re not at yet.</div>

SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair
Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Several times today, you’ve said that you feel you’re well positioned to wait for greater
clarity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At the same time, you could point to quite a few growth risks at the moment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve
seen a stock market that’s gone quite wobbly, rapidly cooling housing sales, plunging confidence
surveys.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, not only did the SEP mark down the growth outlook, 17 of 19 see risks to the
downside.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So my question is, how confident are you that you’re well positioned?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or is that one
more thing that you’re uncertain about?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m confident that we’re well positioned in the sense that we’re,
we’re well positioned to move in the direction we’ll need to move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I mean, I, I don’t know
anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, the point is, we are—we are at, you
know, we’re at a place where we can cut or we—or we can hold what is a clearly a restrictive
stance of policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what I mean.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I mean, I think we’re—that’s well positioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Forecasting right now, it’s—you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current
situation, I just think it’s—uncertainty is, you know, remarkably high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, sorry, standing here today, would you be surprised to, to
pivot back towards rate cuts in May?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, like, I, I think we’re not going to be in any hurry to move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as
I mentioned, I think we’re, we’re well positioned to wait for further clarity, and not in any hurry.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MATT EGAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Matt Egan with CNN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The Fed’s statement
released today removed the line that previously said “the Committee judges that the risks to
achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you explain the
Page 23 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
decision to remove that line?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Does it mean that you’re now more concerned about inflation or
about employment?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Actually, it does not mean either of those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
sometimes with language they—it, it lives its, its useful life, and then we take it off, and we—
and, and that was the case there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s really not meant to be any signal here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past
year, you know, conveying this sense of the balance of risks was important that they be in
balance or close to being in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That was useful as we approach liftoff, if you remember.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re past that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or, I’m sorry, no—beginning, beginning to cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we just—so we just
took it out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I, I actually would say that the more important thing now about risks—and this is in,
in pages like 10, 11, 12 of the SEP—if you look, participants widely raised their estimate of, of
the risks to our—of uncertainty, but also of the risks to growth in our employment and inflation
mandates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s a more salient point now than whether they’re—whether they’re in
balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just on the, the stock market, the stock market has obviously declined
significantly since the Fed last met.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you concerned at all about some of the market volatility
having a real economic impact in terms of hurting business spending or consumer spending,
especially among higher-income households?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So financial conditions matter to us because, you know, financial
conditions are the main channel to the real economy through which our policy has its effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So,
so they’re important.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what matters from, from a Fed standpoint for the macroeconomy is
material changes to overall financial conditions that are persistent, that last for a while—long
enough to actually affect economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what we’re looking for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I’m not going
to opine on the appropriate level of any market—equity, debt, commodities, or anything like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 24 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And I would just point you to the—to the bigger picture again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the, the real
economy, the, the hard data are still in, in reasonably good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s the soft data—it’s the
surveys that are showing, you know, significant concerns, downside risks, and those kind of
things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t dismiss that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re watching it carefully, but, you know, we, we don’t want to
get ahead of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we want to focus on the hard data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This—if it’s—if that’s
going to affect the hard data, we should know it very quickly, and, and, of course, we’ll, we’ll
understand that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you don’t see that yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you look to navigate higher inflation and lower growth, the Fed has talked
about heeding the lessons from the 1970s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the Fed willing to have a recession if it means
breaking the back of inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, fortunately, we’re in a situation where we have seen inflation
move down from, you know, higher levels to pretty close to 2 percent, while the unemployment
rate has remained very consistent with full employment, 4.1 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we now have inflation
coming in from an exogenous source, but the underlying inflationary picture before that was, you
know, basically 2½ percent inflation, I would say, and 2 percent growth, and 4 percent
unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so that’s what—that’s what we did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what, together, the economy
accomplished.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I don’t see any reason to think that we’re looking at, at a replay of the ’70s or
anything like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, inflation—underlying inflation is, is, you know, still running in
the 2s, with probably a little bit of a pickup associated with tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I don’t think we’re
facing—I, I wouldn’t say we’re in, in a situation that’s remotely comparable to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 25 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And last month, the idea of a DOGE dividend was
proposed, which would send $5,000 checks to every taxpayer from DOGE savings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>President
Trump and Elon Musk have supported this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s reports there could be a bill introduced on
Capitol Hill.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What impact might that have on household savings and spending in terms of your
growth and, and outlook for inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I—it’s not—it’s not appropriate for me to speculate on
political ideas or, or fiscal policy, for that matter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m going to—I’m going to pass on that
one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Daniel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>DANIEL AVIS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You
mentioned that tariffs are already having at least some impact on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m just wondering
how you and your colleagues on the FOMC have been thinking about the possibility of
retaliatory tariffs from other countries, especially with April 2 coming up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was it something you
considered during this meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, since the very beginning, we’ve had kind of a placeholder—the
staff has a placeholder of—range of—really a range of possible outcomes from tariffs, and from
trade policy generally.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they generally assume full retaliation in those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that’s, that’s
kind of baked into the numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What happens—it will be complicated, and there will be some
retaliation and some not and, and all that, but, ultimately, they’re trying to, with the placeholder,
give us a broad sense of what this might look like.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This—when we know—when we actually
know the specifics, we’ll be able to, to have still uncertain but, you know, better-informed
forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so, yes, that’s in there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Last question goes to Jean.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 26 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEAN YUNG.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Had a couple
questions on the balance sheet change that you made.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the minutes had initially described
your discussion on slowing QT as temporary, until the debt ceiling is resolved, but it—from what
you said earlier, doesn’t sound like there’s a desire to kind of regain the pace of QT that we have
at the moment after the, the debt ceiling is resolved.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that the case?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Yeah, so we, we looked at pausing, and we looked at, at slowing,
and, really, people came together very strongly behind slowing, not pausing, for a variety of
reasons.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so people really came to be, you know, pretty strongly in favor of, of this move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
slows down the path and probably lengthens it—you know, doubles it, effectively, by slowing it
by half.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s—people thought that’s, that’s a good place to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’ll, it’ll, you know,
help us assure that this path is, is a smooth one as we get closer and closer to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how
that came about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEAN YUNG.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I guess my question is more, was that meant to be a temporary
measure during the debt ceiling episode, or—?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it was—it was actually—it was the, the TGA flows—
Treasury General Account flows that got us thinking about this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the more we thought about
it, we came around to this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, it, it is—yes, it was provoked.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The original
discussion was provoked by that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think what we came up with, though, was broader than
that and different than it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It does address that issue, but it really is also—it fits in really nicely
with our principles and our plans, and the things we’ve done before, and the things we’ve said
we would do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s why I—you know, pretty, pretty strong support.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’d just say it’s, it’s
nothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with the size of the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just
kind of a commonsense adjustment as you get closer and closer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s slow down a little bit
Page 27 of 28

March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, that way, we’ll be more and more confident that we’re getting where we need to get.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can take your time getting there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re shrinking the balance sheet every
month, and we think that’s—we think it was a good play and, as I mentioned, well supported.</div>
