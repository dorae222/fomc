Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 7, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-
run objective.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to
have risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to
respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. [</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Cough] Pardon me.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were likely driven by businesses bringing in
imports ahead of potential tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This unusual swing complicated GDP measurement last
quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the first quarter, the
same as last year’s pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated while
investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated
uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It remains to
be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 1 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Payroll job gains averaged
155,000 per month over the past three months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains
low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Wage growth has continued to moderate,
while still outpacing inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the
labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor
market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat
elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the
12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices
rose 2.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, as reflected in
both market- and survey-based measures.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Survey respondents, including consumers, businesses,
and professional forecasters, point to tariffs as the driving factor.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Beyond the next year or so,
however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent
inflation goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of the balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The tariff increases
announced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All of these policies are still
evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As economic
conditions evolve, we’ll continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based
on the incoming data, the outlook, and the balance of risks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Page 2 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to
generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The effects on inflation could be short lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It is
also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Avoiding that
outcome will depend on the size of the tariffs’ effect—tariff effects, on how long it takes for
them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation
expectations well anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent
a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As we act to
meet that obligation, we’ll balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are
in tension.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For the time being, we’re well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any
adjustments to our policy stance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review
of our monetary policy framework.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We focused on inflation dynamics and the implications for
our monetary policy strategy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference next
week.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Throughout this process, we’re open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take
on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We intend to wrap up the
review by late summer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 3 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to your questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Mr. Chair, for taking my
question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A lot has happened since the last meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There have been tariffs put on, tariffs taken
off, and meanwhile, there was a bill advancing in Congress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I just wonder if I could press
you on the last part of your statement.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you any closer now to deciding which side of the
mandate is going to need urgent care first?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, so, as we noted in our—in our statement—postmeeting
statement, we’ve judged that the risks to higher employment and higher inflation have both risen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And this, by the way, of course, is compared to March.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what we can say.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think
we can say, you know, which way this will shake out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty
about, for example, where tariff policies are going to, to settle out and also, when they do settle
out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s
too early to know that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, I mean, ultimately, we think our policy rate is in—is in a good place
to stay as we await further clarity on tariffs and, ultimately, their implications for the economy.</span></p>

STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hearing you describe what you’re looking for in terms of being able
to make a decision, it sounded like that’s a long-term process before you sound like you’re going
to be comfortable, or the Committee would be comfortable, to act on what the data’s telling you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think we know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I think—look where we are
today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We have an economy that, if you “look through,” you know, the sort of distortions in Q1
GDP, you’ve still got an economy that looks like it’s growing at a solid pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market
appears to be solid.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation is running just a bit above 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s an economy that’s
been resilient and is in good shape, and our policy is sort of modestly or moderately restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was last fall.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we think that leaves us in a good
place to wait and see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t think we need to be in a hurry.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think we can be patient.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to be watching the data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The data may move quickly or slowly, but we do think
we’re in a good position, where we are, to, to let things evolve and become clearer in terms of
what should be the monetary policy response.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos for the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, there’s
naturally a lot of [inaudible] around 2021 in supply shocks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But there are some who argue that
the current situation has notable differences.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Energy costs are down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Housing imbalances look
nothing like they did four years ago.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Labor demand appears to be gradually cooling, with wage
growth running below 4 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">What do you see right now that could nourish higher inflation
beyond a rise in goods prices this year?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think the underlying inflation picture is, is good.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s what you see,
which is inflation now running a bit above 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ve had basically decent readings
in housing services and nonhousing services, which is a big part of it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that part, I think is, is
moving along well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But there’s just so much that we don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think—and we’re in a good position to
wait and see, is the thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t have to be in a hurry.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy is—has been resilient
and is doing fairly well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our policy is well positioned.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The costs of waiting to see further are
fairly low, we think.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what we’re doing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’ll, we’ll see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
Administration is entering into negotiations with many countries over tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll know more
with each week and month that goes by where—about where tariffs are going to land—you
know, land, and we’ll know what the effects will be when we start to see those things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we
think we’ll be learning.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I can’t tell you how long it will take.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, for now, it does seem like
it’s, it’s, it’s a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see and watch.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So when you say that you don’t need to be in a hurry, does that mean
that—could the outlook change in such a way that a change in your stance could be warranted as
soon as your next meeting?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, as I said, we’re—we are comfortable with our policy
stance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think the right—we’re in the right place to wait and see how things evolve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
don’t feel like we need to be in a hurry.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We feel like it’s appropriate to be patient.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, when things develop—of course, we have a record of—we can move quickly when that’s
appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we think right now, the appropriate thing to do is to wait and see how things
evolve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s so much uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you talk to businesses or market participants or
forecasters, everyone is just—is just waiting to see how developments play out, and then we’ll be
able to make a better assessment of what the appropriate path for monetary policy is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re
not in that place, and, you know, as that develops—and I can’t really give you a time frame
on that.</span></p>

JONNELLE MARTE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, many economists have been
pricing in higher odds of a recession, and several are noting that it is more difficult for the Fed to
cut rates preemptively, given the higher risks for higher inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, given the outlook, do you
still see a path for a soft landing, and what does that look like?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, let me say—I mean, so let’s, let’s, let’s look back and see
where we are.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, go through 2024 up to the [present] day.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve had—we’ve had, you know,
unemployment in the low 4s for more than a year, we’ve had inflation coming down in the—now
in the mid-to-low 2s, and we’ve had an economy growing at 2½ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that is—that is the
economy as we see it now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we
will see the—certainly, the risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
if that’s what we do see, if—and if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we
don’t know, then, then we will see—we won’t see further progress toward our goals, but we
might see a delay in that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think in the—you know, in our thinking, we would get—we would
never—we never do anything but keep achieving those goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what we would—at least for
the next, let’s say, year, we would—we would not be making progress toward those goals, again,
if that is—if that’s the way the tariffs shake out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The thing is, we don’t know that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s so
much uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of the tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
terms of preemption, you know, I think you can look back at the 2019 cuts as preemptive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
wouldn’t say that what we did last fall was at all preemptive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If anything, it was a little late.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
2019, we did cut three times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the situation was, you had a weakening economy, and you had
inflation at 1.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s a situation where you can move preemptively.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Now we have
inflation running above target.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has been above target for four years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not so far above
target now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we have an expectation conditional on what happens that we’ll see upward
pressure on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at where forecasters are, they’re all forecasting an increase in
Page 7 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it makes it—and then we’ve also got, you know, forecasts of weakening in the
economy, and some have recession forecasts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t make a—we don’t make—publish a
forecast about, about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t publish a forecast that assesses how likely a recession is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, in any case, it’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don’t
know what the right response to, to the data will be until we see more data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the New York Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">How much weakness does the
Committee need to see, though, in the labor market and the economy more broadly to lower
interest rates again?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Is it about a certain increase in the unemployment rate over a period of
time, or perhaps a certain number of negative monthly job reports?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, how are you making
that assessment?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, so first of all, we don’t see that yet, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have
4.2 percent unemployment, good participation, wages behaving very well, participation, I
mentioned, at a good level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, with the labor market, we would look at the totality of
the—of the data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’d look at the level of the unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’d look at the speed with
which it’s changing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We would look at the whole huge array of labor market data to, to get a
sense of whether conditions are really deteriorating or not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, at the same time, we’d be
looking at the other side of the mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We could be in a position of having to balance those
two things, which is, of course, a very—a difficult balancing judgment that we’d have to make.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On that point about balancing, I mean, you’ve mentioned that the
Committee would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the time it would take to
kind of get back to that point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what does that mean in practice?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, how much of that
assessment will be rooted in a forecast, versus data dependence?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 8 of 25

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It would be a combination of the two.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, let’s just say this is
a—this would be a complicated and challenging judgment that we would have to make if—and
this is—we’re not in this situation, but the situation is if the two goals are in tension.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So let’s say
that unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way and so is inflation—not the situation
we’re in—hypothetically.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they’re
expected to be from the goals, what’s the expected time to get back to their goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’d look at
all those things and make a difficult judgment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s in our framework.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s always been in
our thinking.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s—we haven’t had—we haven’t faced that question in a very long
time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so, again, difficult, difficult judgment to make, and not one that we face today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
we may never face it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we have to be keeping it in our thinking now.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So we had
the CPI report that came out that showed, month over month, the first increase in inflation in
about three years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The jobs report—you said “solid”—that we saw.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time, we have
those new tariffs that we’re living under.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, given this, should the Federal Reserve be cutting
rates at all this year?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s going to depend.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think you have to just take a step
back and realize this is—this is why we are where we are, is, you know, we are going to need to
see how this evolves.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this
year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are cases in which it wouldn’t, and we just don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Until we know more about
how this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment, for—and
for, for inflation, I couldn’t confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be.</span></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, following on that, just, you know—so then how does

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we—you know, we’re
always going to do the same thing—which is, we’re going to use our tools to foster maximum
employment and price stability for the benefit of the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re always going to
consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s it, that’s all we’re
going to consider.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m wondering—I mean, given the complexity about the first-quarter GDP and what lies ahead,
I’m just wondering what your intuition tells you about the underlying direction of the economy
right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many of your colleagues have said they feel growth is slowing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If so, do you have
any sense of by how much, to what degree the slowdown may be?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What does your gut tell you
about how things are evolving out there?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is
extremely elevated [laughter] and that the downside risks have increased.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The risk is—as we
pointed out in our statement, the risks—the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation
have risen, but they haven’t materialized yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They really haven’t.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re not, really not in the
data yet, so that—and that tells me more than by intuition because I think—I think it’s obvious,
actually, that the right thing for us to do is to—we’re in a good place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our policy’s in a very
good place, and the right thing to do is, is await further clarity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I—you know, there’s—
usually, things clarify, and that—the appropriate direction becomes clear.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what usually
Page 10 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Right now, it’s very hard to say what that would be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the meantime, the
economy is doing fine.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our policy isn’t—you know, it’s not highly restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s somewhat
restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was in, you know, last summer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we
think it’s—we think it’s in a good place, and we think the appropriate thing is for us to wait and
see and get more clarity about, about the direction of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, let me press you on this idea of the economy being fine
right now, because, reading the Beige Book very closely the last time around, there was a lot of,
you know, negative stuff, negative sentiment that was in there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I know that everybody’s
looking at soft data right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned it yourself—that the sentiment’s sour.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the
Beige Book was talking about, you know, the beginnings of layoffs in some industries, prices
rising in, in some places, and an awful lot of investment decisions being, being pushed to the
sideline.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Doesn’t that point to a slowdown?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It just hasn’t shown up yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, we all
look at all these sentiments and read many, many individual comments just to get a better feel.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it—you know, businesses and households very broadly are concerned and, you know,
postponing economic decisions of various kinds.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, yes, if that continues and nothing,
nothing happens to sort of alleviate those concerns, then you would expect that to begin to show
up in economic data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It wouldn’t maybe show up overnight, but it would show up over weeks
and months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that may be what happens, but it hasn’t happened yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And also, there are
things that can happen that will—that will change that narrative.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, they haven’t happened,
but it’s possible to imagine things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in the meantime, yes, we’re watching it extremely
carefully, like everyone is, but don’t see really much evidence of it in the actual economic data
yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And by the way, consumers keep spending, credit card spending.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—you know, it’s
Page 11 of 25

still—it’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment
on the part of people and businesses.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
Fed’s been criticized recently by a former Governor for what he calls “mission creep”—you take
on more problems, use more tools, and then end up building tools to deal with the fallout of those
tools, which then makes it a given that you will act more aggressively in the future.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that a fair
critique, and is that something you would be looking at in your framework review?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry, say that critique again.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That the Fed has been involved in mission creep—gets involved in
using too many new tools to deal with problems and to go too far.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that something that—the
critique was based around the fact that you did QE and QE and QE and—
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE. —</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">and went beyond the narrow confines of your mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—well, I mean, there are a couple—that’s not really beyond the
confines of our mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—look, I would say this: We—you know, we did things—essentially,
we were on an emergency footing for a couple of years in the pandemic, and it’s very fair and
very welcome for people to look back over what we did and say, “Hey, you could have done this
better and different.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And one thing we hear a lot is, we could have explained the QE a little
better.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We did think we were explaining it in real time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I completely accept the, the thought that
we could have explained it better.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a lot of thinking that we went on too long with QE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
can tell you that the reason we did was, we were—we were concerned that we didn’t want a
tightening of—a sharp tightening in financial conditions at a time when we thought the economy
Page 12 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was still vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we did hold on for a long time to QE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we, of course, tapered
and everything.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then we immediately went into QT, and, you know, we’ve—we’re down a
couple of trillion.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I get the—that, you know, we, we certainly, with the benefit of hindsight,
could have tapered earlier or faster.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s absolutely right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But this is all very welcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You
know, it’s, it’s—you know, we knew, doing this in real time, that we weren’t going to get it
perfect.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And those kind of—those kind of, you know, after-action kind of looks are essential.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re doing the same thing in—you know, in our review, so—on some issues.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There—the other part of that critique is that you’ve taken on topics
that are outside of the mandate, such as climate change and trying to ensure that certain groups
are benefited by your economic policies in terms of employment, et cetera.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, okay, on climate, you’ve heard me say over and over again that
we will not be climate policymakers and that our role on climate is a very, very narrow one.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
I think—I think that’s what we’ve done.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve done really very little on climate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can say
that was—that little bit that we’ve done was too much.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I wouldn’t want to give any
impression that, that, you know, we take—that we’ve taken climate in and it’s something that
we’re spending a lot of time and energy on.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have very, very narrow things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
did one thing, one guidance for the banks, and then we did one—a one-time stress analysis,
climate stress analysis, and that’s it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we dropped out of the Network for
Greening the Financial System.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we didn’t do much on climate, but—and I do think, and I’ve
said this publicly several times, I think it’s, it’s a real danger for us to try to take on a mandate
like that, which is very narrow application to our work.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, the risk is, if you—if
you go for things that are really not on your mandate, you know, then why are you independent?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I think that’s a very fair question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I do think we’ve done a whole lot less on
climate than some people seem to think we did.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Anyway, that’s what I think.</span></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Should you have taken on the question of bringing unemployment
rates down for specific categories?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We didn’t do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, we said—what we said was that we
never targeted any unemployment rate for individual racial or demographic groups.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What we
said was that maximum employment was a broad and inclusive goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I think what we meant
by that was, we’re going to consider the totality of the country as we look at our maximum-
employment goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, we were never going to target on any individual group with that,
but I think some people, you know, wanted to hear it that way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s not at all what we
meant.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But—so that’s just not a correct reading of our—but I can see how, you know, maybe
people found that confusing, and, you know, we have to take that into consideration.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m Jo Ling
Kent with CBS News.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve said, “Wait and see” and “The economy is doing fine” today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the impact of tariffs are already showing up at the ports.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Businesses big and small are telling
us that they feel it, and most importantly, consumers say they feel it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the challenges are here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there’s no waiting and seeing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For Main Street, what is the breaking point?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What would
have to happen to prompt a rate cut specifically?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, you know, so we really don’t see in the data yet big economic
effects.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We see—we see sentiment, their concerns that higher prices may be coming, or things
like that, but—so people, they’re worried now about inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re worried about, you
know, a shock from the tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But they really haven’t—that shock hasn’t hit yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Okay, so, you
know, we’re going to be looking at not just the sentiment data, but also the real economic data as
we assess what it is we should do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And remember, we’re—there will be two effects.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One of
them would be weakening economy—weakening economic activity, which translates into higher
Page 14 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployment, and the other would be potentially higher inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, to say it again, the
timing, the scope, the scale, and the persistence of those effects are very, very uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s
not at all clear what the appropriate response for monetary policy is at this time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re—
you know—and by the way, our policy’s in a good place, so we think we can wait and move
when it is clear what the right thing to do is; really not at all clear what it is we should do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So
people are feeling stress and concern, but unemployment hasn’t gone up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Job creation is fine.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wages are in good shape.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, people are not—layoffs are—people are not getting laid
off at high levels.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, initial claims for unemployment are not increasing, you know, in
any kind of impressive way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the economy itself is still, you know, in solid shape.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just a quick follow-up: President Trump now says he does not plan to
remove you as Chair.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When you heard that, what did you think?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t have anything more for you on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve pretty much
covered that issue.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I
just wanted to follow up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Earlier, it sounded like you said it was unclear how the Fed—you
know, what kind of interest rate decisions you will make later this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So does that—you
know, in March, there was guidance that two cuts might happen, you know, two cuts were
penciled in for this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that now—that guidance from the last press conference, has that
been overtaken by events at this point?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we don’t do a Summary of Economic Projections at
every meeting, as you know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We do it every other meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so this was the meeting when
we didn’t do it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I—you know, we don’t also kind of poll people, so I really—I really
wouldn’t want to try to make a specific projection for where we are relative to that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will—in

six weeks, we have the June meeting, and you’ll have another SEP.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not going to hazard a
guess here today what—as to what it would be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, what I would say is that we think our
policy rate is in a good place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think it leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to
potential developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s where we are, and that—depending on the way things play out,
that could include rate hikes—sorry, rate cuts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it could include us holding where we
are.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just are going to need to see, you know, how things play out before we make those
decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Great.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just to follow up on that, I mean, when you
address the issue of how the Fed would handle both rising unemployment and rising inflation,
how are you thinking about the fact that addressing one could exacerbate the other?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So a rate cut
to reduce unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How does that—how do you
handle those challenges?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, you just captured the—this is the issue with the two goals
being in tension.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a very challenging question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, there can be a case in which one goal is
very far—one variable’s very far from its goal, much farther than the other.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if so, you
concentrate on that one.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, frankly, that was the case—well, it wasn’t a case where they were
really in tension.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But if you go back to 2022, it was very clear that we needed to focus on
inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market was also super tight, so it wasn’t really a tradeoff.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, if—I
think you know what our—what our framework document says.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It says we’ll look at how far
each goal—each variable is from its goal and also we’ll factor in the time it would take to get
there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, that’s going to be a—potentially, a very difficult judgment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the data
could break in a way that it’s not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I just don’t think we know that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The data could
easily favor one or the other.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And right now, there’s no way to—no need to make a choice and
no real basis for doing so.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria Guida with Politico.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask, Congress is
currently debating spending cuts alongside expending—extending the tax cuts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I know
you’ve talked many times about how the path of the debt is unsustainable.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But given that we’re
also talking right now about the economy slowing, potentially even recession, I was just
wondering, is there a danger that spending cuts now could slow growth a lot more?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we don’t give Congress fiscal advice.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—they’re going
to do—we take what they do as a given, and we put it in our models and in our assessment of the
economy, so I wouldn’t want to, you know, speculate on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I think we do know that
the debt is on an unsustainable level—on an unsustainable path—not on an unsustainable level,
but an unsustainable path.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s on Congress to figure out how to get us back on a sustainable
path, and, you know, it’s not up to us to give them advice.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, do you think that they should take macroeconomic
conditions into account as they look at this?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think they don’t need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal
policy any more than we need their advice on monetary policy. [</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Andrew Ackerman with the
Washington Post.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In your Jackson Hole comments last year, you said you would not welcome
further cooling in labor market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate then was 4.2 percent, which
is what it is now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Forecasters—many forecasters now predict a higher jobless rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">How has
your tolerance for weakening labor market conditions changed compared to a year ago?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it was quite a different situation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What was happening last year is
that over the space of six, eight, seven months, the unemployment rate went up by almost a full
Page 17 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know,
everywhere, people were talking about downside risks to the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time,
payroll job numbers were getting softer and softer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So there was a really obvious concern about
downside risk to the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so at Jackson Hole and then in September, you know, we
wanted to address that forthrightly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We wanted to show that we were there for the—I mean, we
had been there for inflation for a couple of years, and we wanted to show also that we’re there
for the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it was important that we send that signal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Fortunately, since then, the
labor market has really—and the unemployment rate have really been moving sideways at a level
that is, you know, well in the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that
concern has gotten a lot less.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, you know, you’re at 4.2 percent unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we
were in a very different situation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And now we have a situation where, you know, the risks to
higher inflation and higher unemployment have both gone up, as we noted in our statement, and
we’ve got to monitor both of those.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We actually have a potential situation where there may be a
tradeoff or tension between the two potentially.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t have it yet, and we may not have it,
but that’s what we [may] have, and that’s why I think it’s a very different, different situation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I mean, I guess I want to follow up by asking how much of
a rise in the jobless rate you would—you could tolerate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I can’t give you a—you know, a—I’m not going to try to give you a
specific number.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I’ll just say, we’ve got—we have to now be looking at both variables and
which of them is, is, you know, demanding—if one of them is demanding our focus more than
the other, that would tell us what to do with policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If they’re more or less this, you know,
equally distant and equally—or not distant, then we don’t have to make that assessment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You
know, the assessment is, you wait.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m not going to try to be really specific about what we
need to see in terms of the number.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if—look, if we did see, you know, significant
Page 18 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deterioration in the labor market, of course that’s one of our two variables, and we would look to
be able to support that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’d hope that it wasn’t also coming at a time when inflation was
getting very bad.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, we’re speculating here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know any
of these things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s very hypothetical.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re just going to have to wait and see how the—how it
plays out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CLAIRE JONES.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Claire Jones, Financial Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of getting some clarity, we’ve
got some talks at the weekend in Geneva between the U.S. and China.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A lot of economists are
ask—are attaching an awful lot of importance to how—what we hear from those talks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How
much importance are you attaching to them in terms of judging what will happen to the U.S.
economy going forward?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just in a similar vein, you know, some economists are saying it’s
days, not weeks, that we have until we start to put the U.S. economy at risk of seeing a sort of
pandemic here, with shortages and higher prices, if we don’t kind of soothe relations between the
U.S. and China.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it would be good to have your view on that, too.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, these are not talks that we’re in any way involved in,
so I really can’t comment directly on them.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but what I will say is this: You know, we
had—coming out of the March meeting, we, we—the public generally had an assessment of
where tariffs were going.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then April 2 happened, and it was really substantially larger than
anticipated in the forecasts that I’ve seen and in our forecast.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and now we—and now we
have a different—we’re in a new phase where—it seems to be we’re entering a new phase where
the Administration is entering into beginning talks with a number of our important trading
partners.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s—that has the potential to change the picture materially or not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I
think it’s going to be very important how that shakes out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I—you know, we simply have to
Page 19 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wait and see how it works out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It certainly could change the picture, and we’re mindful of not
trying to make conclusive judgments about what will happen at a time when the—you know,
when the facts are changing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And just on the fall in shipping volumes from China over these
tensions, I mean, do you share that concern that we could start seeing goods shortages and higher
prices in the coming weeks if this isn’t resolved very quickly?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I don’t want to get my—we’re not—we shouldn’t be
involved, even verbally, in questions about the timing of these things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yes, we’re—of course,
we follow all that data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see the shipping data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see all that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, ultimately, this is for the
Administration to do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is—you know, this is their mandate, not ours.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I know they’re—
as you can see, they’re, again, having—beginning to have talks with many nations.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that has
the potential to change the picture materially, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the volume of imports—

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">KOSUKE TAKAMI. —</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">imported goods has increased significantly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the impact of the
imported inflation may delay.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, what is the impact to your future decision?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Okay, so, I mean, I think we—I think we think that the—you know,
there was a big spike in imports—right?—very big, historically large, really, and—to beat tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 20 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And now that should actually reverse so that it’s—you know, it’s the difference between—it’s
exports minus imports, so—and imports were huge, and so then it conveyed a very negative
contribution to U.S. GDP—annualized GDP in the first quarter, as we all know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that could, in
the second quarter, be reversed so that we have, you know, an unusually large contribution to—
unusually positive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">That’s very likely as imports drop sharply.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You could also have—you know,
very likely you’ll have restatements of the—of the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’ll turn out that consumer
spending was higher.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It will turn out that inventories were higher.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so you’ll see—you’ll see
those data revised up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may actually go into the third quarter, too.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I think it’s going—
this whole process is going to, a little bit, make it harder to make a clean assessment of U.S.
demand.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mentioned private domestic final purchases, which doesn’t have inventories,
government, or—inventories, government.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Anyway, it’s a cleaner read on private demand.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But
that, that, too, probably was flattered a little bit by—you know, by strong demand for imports to
be tariffed.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that might overstate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a really good reading, 3 percent PDFP in the first
quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That might actually overstate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s not really going to—I don’t think it’s going to
affect our decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will just say, though, that it’s a little confusing and it’s probably less
confusing to us than it would be to the general public as we try to explain this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s
complicated, and, you know, GDP is sending a signal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">PDFP is sending a signal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a little bit
confusing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think we understand what’s going, and it’s not really going to change things
for us.</span></p>

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I guess, you
know, we talked about some of the indications of potential layoffs, price hikes, an economic
slowdown all being evident in the soft data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m curious why the Fed needs to wait for that to
translate into hard data to, you know, make any type of monetary policy decision, especially if
Page 21 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the hard data is not as timely or might be warped by tariff-related effects.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you worried that
the soft data might be some sort of false warning?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, it’s—look, the—look at the state of the economies.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The
labor market is solid.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation is low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can afford to be patient as things unfold.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s no
real cost to our waiting at this point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Also, the sense of it—the sense of it is, we’re not sure what
the right thing will be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, there should be some increase in inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">There should be
some increase in unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those call for different responses.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so until we know—
potentially call for different responses—and so, you know, until we know more, we have the
ability to wait and see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it seems to be a pretty clear decision.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everyone on the Committee
supported waiting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that’s why we’re waiting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just a very quick follow-up: There was this sort of vibe
session, if you will, where the sentiments expressed in soft data did not translate into the hard
economic data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you—how are you thinking about that when interpreting some of the signs
in the softer survey data?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I think, going back a number of years, the link between
sentiment data and consumer spending has been weak.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not been a strong link at all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the
other hand, we haven’t had a move of this, you know, speed and size.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it wouldn’t be the case
that we’re looking at this and just completely dismissing it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s another reason to wait and
see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re right that we had a couple of years during the pandemic where people were
saying—just very downbeat surveys and going out and spending money.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that can happen,
and that may happen to some degree here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is an outsized change in
sentiment, though, and so none of us are looking at this and saying that we’re sure one way or
the other.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Matt Egan with CNN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you mentioned earlier
that you’re monitoring the shipping data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we have seen in the shipping data that imports
from China into the Port of Los Angeles have plunged.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that has raised concerns about
potential shortages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">What tools, if any, does the Fed have to ensure that prices and inflation
expectations don’t get out of hand if tariffs do cause significant supply chain disruptions?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I mean, we don’t have, you know, the kind of tools that are good at
dealing with supply chain problems.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t have that at all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a—that’s a job for the
Administration and for the private sector more than anything.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, what we can do with
our interest rate tool is, we can support—be more or less supportive of demand.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s—
that’d be a very inefficient way to try to fix supply chain problems.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, you know, we don’t
see—we don’t see the inflation yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, of course, reading the same stories and watching the
same data as everybody else.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, right now, we see inflation, you know, kind of
moving sideways at a fairly low level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MATT EGAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up on that, President Trump has indicated that he will
likely name a replacement for you when your term as Chair expires next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But your position
on the Board runs through January 2028, I believe.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would you consider remaining on the Fed
Board even if you’re no longer Chair?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t have anything for you on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My whole focus is on—
and my colleagues’ focus is all on, you know, trying to navigate this tricky passage we’re in right
now, trying to make the right decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we want to make the best decisions for the
people that we serve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we think about day and night.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And this is a challenging
situation, and that’s, that’s 100 percent of our focus right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Jennifer for the last question.</span></p>

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you so much, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jennifer Schonberger
with Yahoo Finance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Public records of your schedule so far this year show no meetings with
President Trump.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Past Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have all met with Fed Chairs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
you met with Trump during his first term.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why haven’t you asked for a meeting yet with the
President?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve never asked for a meeting with any President, and I never will.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not—I wouldn’t do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s always
been the other way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So would you want to meet with him if given the
opportunity—
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I never—
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">to get more information?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I never—it’s never an initiative that I take.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s always an
initiative—I—you know, I don’t think it’s up to a Fed Chair to seek a meeting with the
President, although maybe some have done so.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve never done so, and I can’t imagine myself
doing that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—I think it’s always—comes the other way: A President wants to meet with you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that hasn’t happened.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if I could just ask one question on monetary policy,
when it is time to cut rates, how will you determine how far down rates will have to come to try
to keep a balance on the inflation mandate as employment weakens?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I think once you have a direction—a clear direction, you
can make a—we can make a judgment about how fast to move and that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s—
really, the harder question is the timing, I think, and when will that become clear?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
fortunately, as I mentioned, we have our policy in a good place, the economy’s in a good place,

and it’s really appropriate, we think, for us to be patient and wait for things to unfold as we get
more clarity about what we should do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks very much.</span></p>
