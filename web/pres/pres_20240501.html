Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 1, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</span> <small>(0.817)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Inflation has
eased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s
very good news.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not
assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are fully committed to returning inflation to our
2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market
that benefits all.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our restrictive stance of monetary
policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past
year.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our
2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.851)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters, even as high interest rates
Page 1 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have weighed on housing and equipment investment.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Improving supply conditions have
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come
into better balance.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while
the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Strong job creation over the past year has
been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation
among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal
wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor
demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of
2 percent.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The inflation data
received so far this year have been higher than expected.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Although some measures of short-term
inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear
to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities
Page 2 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
holdings, though at a slower pace.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and
inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved
toward better balance.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly
attentive to inflation risks.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range
for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is
likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are
prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress we’ve seen on inflation.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too
little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In considering any adjustments
to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,
the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks
and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to
make decisions meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Turning to our balance sheet: The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the
pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per
month to $25 billion per month as of June 1.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold
primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities
Page 3 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unchanged per month, and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury
securities.</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion
per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The decision to
slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it
would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In particular,
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities
holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to
set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We, at the
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">A question and
follow-up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still—are you confident that it’s
sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So I do think the evidence shows, you know, pretty clearly that
policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for
that.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can start with the labor market.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So demand is still strong—the demand side of the
labor market, in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,
Page 4 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and you see that in job openings.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You saw it—more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report,
as you’ll know.</span> <small>(0.688)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s still higher than pre-pandemic.</span> <small>(0.719)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it has been coming down both in the
Indeed report and the JOLTS report.</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">That’s, that’s demand cooling.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The same is true of quits
and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I also look at the—we look at surveys of
workers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses, and [they] ask workers, “Are jobs
plentiful?”</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">and ask businesses, “Are workers plentiful?</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it easy to find workers?”</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you’ve
seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You also see in
interest-sensitive spending, like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates
are weighing on those activities.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sufficiently restrictive, I guess.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that]
over time it will be sufficiently restrictive.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That will be a question that, that the data will have to
answer.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So as a follow-up, if inflation continues running roughly
sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and
expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for—
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Expectations are not anchored?</span> <small>(0.385)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are anchored.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Stable, roughly.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would you disrupt that for the last half point
on PCE?</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I don’t want to get into complicated hypotheticals.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I
would say that, you know, we’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy
for as long as is appropriate.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll do that.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.788)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wonder—you
know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to
increase further, although it’s not her baseline outlook.</span> <small>(0.351)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wonder if you see that as a risk as well,
and, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’d say it’s unlikely.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is—
which is how long to keep policy restrictive.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You ask, what would it take?</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, I think
we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re
seeing, as I—as I mentioned, but that’s—something like that is what it would take.</span> <small>(0.373)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’d look at
the totality of the data in answer to that question.</span> <small>(0.592)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That would include inflation, inflation
expectations, and all the other data too.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Would that be—would that be a reacceleration in inflation?</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come
to that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of
all the things we’d be looking at.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It could be expectations.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could be a combination of things.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that
conclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You
didn’t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn’t mention the idea that it
might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
has the Fed sort of dropped its easing bias?</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Where are you standing on that?</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, on—let me address cuts.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, obviously, our decisions that we
make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving,
and the balance of risks, as always.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll look at the totality of the data.</span> <small>(0.628)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, and we
think, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And
we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance
until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward
2 percent.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves
more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving
sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could
be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think there’s also other paths that the economy could take, which, which would cause us
to want to consider rate cuts.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain
greater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and
another path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example.</span> <small>(0.358)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it really will depend on the
data.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question.</span> <small>(0.682)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I think the data
will have to answer that question for us.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 7 of 26

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And could you just follow—on the path where you might
not cut, is that—you mentioned that would be inflation persistent—I mean, is inflation—would
that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin
to reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know,
moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the
performance of inflation.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’d also be looking at inflation expectations.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’d be looking at the
whole story.</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that
decision.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, to what
extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in
growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed
to resume the sort of disinflation the economy saw last year?</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it’s hard to know that.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ll be able to look back,
you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, if you look
at—let’s look at growth.</span> <small>(0.415)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Really, what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth
coming in about consistent with where it was last year.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I know GDP came in lower, but you
don’t see an acceleration in growth.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, the thought would be that financial conditions
loosened in, in, December, and that caused an uptick in activity, and that caused inflation.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Presumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You don’t really see that
happening.</span> <small>(0.352)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as, as last year.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 8 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So, you know, what’s causing this inflation?</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ll, we’ll have a better sense of that
over time.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t know that there’s an obvious connection there, though, with easing of
financial conditions.</span> <small>(0.781)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rates are certainly higher now
and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And they’re higher,
and that’s tighter financial conditions.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation
has done in the first quarter.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’t necessarily
preclude rate cuts.</span> <small>(0.368)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wonder, would continued strength in the labor market change your view
about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was
reaccelerating?</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the
labor market.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And remember what we saw last year: very strong growth, a really tight labor
market, and a historically fast decline in inflation.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and that’s because we know there are
two forces at work here.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions
and demand-side distortions, and there’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary
policy.</span> <small>(0.717)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I wouldn’t give
up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because, you know, we do
see that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing.</span> <small>(0.386)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And also,
even when the supply-side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic
activity and ultimately inflation.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there are still those things.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t like to say that either
strong—either growth or, or a strong labor market, in and of itself, would automatically create
problems on inflation, because, of course, it didn’t do that last year.</span> <small>(0.381)</small></p>

You ask about wages.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also don’t—we don’t target wages.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We target price inflation.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is one of the inputs.</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The point with wages is, of course, we, like everyone else, like to see high
wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s really what we’re
trying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to
bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Part of that will probably be having
wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.</span> <small>(0.575)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is
sustainably moving back down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s May now.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you have time this year to cut
three times, just given the calendar?</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not really thinking of it that way.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, the—what
we said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said
that we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’ve said that it appears, then,
that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t know how long
it’ll take.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in
scope.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I don’t know exactly when that will be.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on
now, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more
worrying than just expected bumpiness?</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—you know, not really.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, what, what—so I thought it was
appropriate to reserve judgment until, until we had the full quarter’s data, until we saw the March
data.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so take a step back.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What do we now see in the first quarter?</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see strong economic
Page 10 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We see three inflation readings, and
so I think you’re at a point there where you should take some signal.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t like to react to
one or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now,
and we are taking signal.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us
to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the
signal that we’re taking now.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chair, if I could—Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up
on that: What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first
quarter?</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and
quarters?</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we will—you know, we will put the thing—we have put
the thing under a microscope.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will say, nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to
change the view.</span> <small>(0.575)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that, in fact, we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer
to get that confidence—but—confidence.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just think—you know the story.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s happened
since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher
nonhousing services inflation than expected.</span> <small>(0.346)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And those two are working together to, to sort of be
higher than we had thought.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know,
we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation
move back down.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s my forecast.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think my confidence in that is lower than it was
because of the data that we’ve seen.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, we’re looking at those things.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also
continue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market
rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We believe that it

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
will.</span> <small>(0.681)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It just—it looks like the lag—that there are substantial lags between when, you know,
lower market rates turned up and—for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or
for in-housing services.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could just follow up: Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea
that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you’re holding
rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say that.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, the active tool of monetary policy
is, of course, the interest rates.</span> <small>(0.810)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to
slow, really not in order to, you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be
less restrictive to the economy.</span> <small>(0.751)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance
sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial
market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve
ever done this.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Craig.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CRAIG TORRES.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Two questions.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First, a simple one.</span> <small>(0.628)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased
or stayed the same?</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the first question.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Second question.</span> <small>(0.672)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, you joined the
Board in 2012, and I’m sure you remember, as I do, what the jobless recovery was like: lawyers,
accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’t get jobs.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And given your history
there, I wonder if there’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here.</span> <small>(0.732)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We have strong
productivity growth that’s helping wages grow up—go up.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We have good employment.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so
it seems to me there’s a lot of hysteria about inflation.</span> <small>(0.777)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I agree—you know, nobody likes it, but is
Page 12 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
there an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over
time?</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut
until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
didn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in fact, what really
happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence.</span> <small>(0.371)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think
there are—you know, I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to
predict—to predict its path.</span> <small>(0.569)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s really going to depend on the data.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our,
our sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of
them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It actually—it’s the
time to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal.</span> <small>(0.606)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that was
clearly inflation.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So our focus was very much on inflation.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As—and this is what we referred to
in the statement.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month
basis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The employment goal now comes
back into focus.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we are focusing on it.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and that’s how we think about that.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Claire.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CLAIRE JONES.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask
the questions.</span> <small>(0.746)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that
you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that’s going to allow you to have a situation where
rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’d be good if you could just
Page 13 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
confirm whether or not that’s a correct reading.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the Q1 GDP print has led to some—some to
start mentioning the term “stagflation” with respect to the U.S. economy.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you or anyone else
on the FOMC think this is now a risk?</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not dealing really in likelihoods.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think there are—there
are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal
forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t know that it
will be enough, sufficient.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t know that it won’t.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’re going to have to let the data
lead us on that.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation.</span> <small>(0.686)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess I would say I
was around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was
high single-digits inflation.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have
3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we
have inflation running under 3 percent.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that
last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know—
and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that would be—that would
be our forecast.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That wouldn’t be stagflation.</span> <small>(0.361)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That would still be to a very healthy level of
growth.</span> <small>(0.386)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, with inflation, you know, our—we will return inflation to 2 percent, and
that won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually. [</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, he’s “Mr. Potential Growth/r*.”</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you share that view, and would
that imply that maybe policy isn’t tight enough?</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of
very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity
growth in 2022.</span> <small>(0.373)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it’s hard to draw from the data.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, the question is, will
productivity run—there are two questions.</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One is: Will productivity run persistently above its
longer-run trend?</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think we know that.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of potential output, though, that’s a
separate question.</span> <small>(0.730)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve had a—what amounts to a, a significant increase in the potential output
of the economy that’s not about productivity.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was about having more labor, frankly, both
through—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration.</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re very
much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for
potential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter, too.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think—in that
case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ve also got—so
you’ve got more supply.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So you’ve also got demand.</span> <small>(0.415)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you
get demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary
over, over a longer period.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You said earlier that, at this point, you’re not really considering
rate increases.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If growth is higher, but you’re not considering rate increases, does that imply that
you’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation
taking off again?</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is
appropriate to the current situation.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence

for that, I went over earlier.</span> <small>(0.635)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You see it in the labor market.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You see it in inflation-sensitive
spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years.</span> <small>(0.402)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s, that’s
more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the
supply side.</span> <small>(0.712)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how I would think about it.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So GDP growth is about 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation—[Un]employment is about 4 percent.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It
feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if the data remains the same
that you’re seeing, and I know you said you don’t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you
would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So was there any discussion about a
rate hike in today’s meeting, and, you know, are you satisfied with 3 percent inflation for the rest
of the year?</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation. “</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Three
percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [</span> <small>(0.690)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Laughter] So we will return inflation to
2 percent over time but over time.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably
down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
don’t see that.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t see evidence for that.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s where we are.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do
about, about holding the current—the current level of restriction.</span> <small>(0.823)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s really—that’s part of the
policy.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is there a time frame

these are going to be judgment calls.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more
time to do its job.</span> <small>(0.754)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that is pretty clear, based on what we’re seeing.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How long that will take

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I was just wondering, given that it’s an

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, similarly, is there a
significant economic difference between, you know, starting to cut in, say, September versus

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
it’s hard enough to get the economics right here.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These are difficult things, and if, if we were to
take on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood
we’d actually get the economics right.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how we think about it around here.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, we’re at peace over it.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Question about the labor market—
you’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Certainly, today’s JOLTS
data suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre-pandemic levels.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">One thing that hasn’t
normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wonder
if you can share your analysis of, of why that’s happening.</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it a lagging indicator, or is
something else going on?</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So I think if you go back to where wages peaked—wage increases
peaked a couple, three years ago—essentially all wage measures have come down substantially
[when compared] to that.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But they are not, not down to where they were before the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 18 of 26

They’re still roughly a percentage point higher.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ve seen pretty consistent progress but
not uniformly.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you’ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was—it was expected to be—to

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So yeah,
I mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, again, we don’t target wage increases, but, you know,
in the longer run, if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity
would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What would you
say to them?</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck, and
suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price, you, you are in
trouble right away.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’re doing is, we’re
using our tools to bring down inflation.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It will take some time, but we will succeed.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we will
bring inflation back down to 2 percent, and then people won’t have to worry about it again.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>

be paid and will be very large.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is
doing what it’s supposed to do, and it’s—but it’s also, in this case unusually, working alongside
and with the healing of the supply side.</span> <small>(0.750)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This, this—what was different this time was that a big
part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we
had this supply-side kind of collapse, with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other
things that, that really raised demand.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, many factors did that.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think now you see those
two things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the
pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those two things are
working to bring down inflation, and we’ve made a lot of progress.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s remember how far
we’ve come.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we have a ways to go.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve got work left to do, but we’re not looking at the
very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.788)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing
inflation.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s kind of been this long-awaited disinflation in shelter that still hasn’t arrived.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private-
sector data we’re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be
helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 20 of 26

CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, essentially, there are—there are a number of places in the
economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process, and housing is one of
them.</span> <small>(0.814)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So when you have—when, when someone goes to—a new person goes to rent an
apartment, that’s called market rent, and you can see market rents are barely going up at all.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The
inflation in those has been very low.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it takes—before that, they were incredibly high.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They
sort of led the, the high part.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what happens is, those market rents take years, actually, to get
all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases.</span> <small>(0.821)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Landlords don’t tend to
charge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant, for whatever reason.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what that does is it
builds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases.</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
what happens is, you know—it’s complicated, but the story is it just takes some time for that to
get in.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in
measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How—what will be the exact
timing of it?</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ve learned that the lags are longer.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We now think significantly longer
than we thought at the beginning, and so confident that it will come but not so confident in the
timing of it.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But, yes, I expect that, that this will happen.</span> <small>(0.379)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Jasinski.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions.</span> <small>(0.801)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is
Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s Magazine.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It seems that over the past three or four years,
economies and central banks in developed markets, at least, have been on more or less the same
trajectory: easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the
U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well.</span> <small>(0.756)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So my question is, what, what
Page 21 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
considerations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central
bank policies present for the FOMC?</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that—you’re right.</span> <small>(0.393)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that, that may happen, and, you know
that we all serve domestic mandates, right?</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think the difference between the United States
and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of
growth we’re having.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little
better, but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we actually have
the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job
creation, and all of that, and we can be patient.</span> <small>(0.385)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as
we approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming.</span> <small>(0.719)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s
priced in now.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think, you know,
we haven’t seen—in addition, for the emerging market economies, we haven’t seen the kind of
turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s, I think, partly because
emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much
more credibility on inflation.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jennifer.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to
encounter pain for inflation to come back down.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, given the sticky inflation data in the first
quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy, or is some
softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?</span> <small>(0.381)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 22 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we thought, and most people thought, there
would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor
market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of
this episode.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That didn’t happen.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a tremendous result.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re very, of course, gratified
and pleased that that hasn’t happened.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it
really was that this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren’t
to do with monetary policy but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know,
supply problems—supply-side problems and also some, some demand issues as well.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, as I’ve said, I’m not giving up on
that.</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I think—I think it is possible that, that those forces will still work to help us bring
inflation down.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can’t—we can’t be guaranteed that that’s true, though.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And so we’re—you
know, we’re trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy
strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.</span> <small>(0.402)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We will bring inflation
down to 2 percent sustainably.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We hope we can do it without, you know, without significant
dislocations in the labor market or elsewhere.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And speaking of dislocations in the labor market: In
terms of cutting, you said, if there were weakness in the job market, that could be a reason to cut
rates.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to
your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Would the unemployment rate popping back
above 4 percent catch your attention?</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I
characterized it.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to
Page 23 of 26

May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">A
couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be—would probably not do that.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But a
broader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be
appropriate to consider cutting.</span> <small>(0.364)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and
circumstances, not just that one.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">KYLE CAMPBELL.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question.</span> <small>(0.779)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Kyle Campbell with
American Banker.</span> <small>(0.773)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III
Endgame proposal, and you’ve mentioned that a re-proposal is something that’s on the table.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As
you’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the
options available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re-proposal will be necessary,
and do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on
that front—either a re-proposal or a move to finalize?</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let me—let me start by saying that the Fed is committed to, you
know, completing this process and carrying out Basel III Endgame in a way that’s faithful to
Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
haven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nothing.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No decisions
have been made.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll say again, though, if we conclude that re-proposal is appropriate, we won’t
hesitate to insist on that.</span> <small>(0.366)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then do you need to resolve issues with the capital proposal in
order to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda, or do you expect to continue to make
progress on those other agenda items?</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, there’s no mechanical rule in place there.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would say
that the, you know, the Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is, I think,
occupying us at this time in terms of what’s, what’s—what we’re moving ahead with.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Mark for the last question.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MARK HAMRICK.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</span> <small>(0.743)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, what
can you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in the sense of trying to achieve
consensus, which you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or
even dissent?</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more
spirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do you avoid groupthink and
avoid a higher risk of a policy mistake?</span> <small>(0.735)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues
on the FOMC, you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
really don’t.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have
12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people
who work here at the Board.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are different people.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, and so each, each Reserve
Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.716)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.</span> <small>(0.759)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents.</span> <small>(0.750)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people.</span> <small>(0.733)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I try to incorporate
their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I
think many people, if they feel that’s happening, you know, that for most people most of the

time, that’ll be enough.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And—but I’m not—I mean, it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or
illegal or against the rules or anything like that.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It just is the way things come out.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly, more
diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and
demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D. economists.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we have
people from business and law and academia and things like that.</span> <small>(0.782)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we actually do have
quite a good diverse perspective.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity,
and we look around the room and say, “I don’t understand.</span> <small>(0.734)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I really don’t understand what
they’re talking about.”</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but I get the question, though.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
