Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 7, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state and remains solid.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent
as of September.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting
maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint
by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We continue to be confident that,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor
market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also
decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more to say about monetary
policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.851)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the
second quarter.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in
equipment and intangibles has strengthened.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been
weak.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.
economy over the past year.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This figure would have
been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment

in October.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families,
businesses, and communities who have been harm—harmed by these devastating storms.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over
the past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October.</span> <small>(0.614)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth has
eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Overall, a broad set of
indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the
pandemic in 2019.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Total PCE prices rose
2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Longer-term inflation
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we’re attentive to the risks to
both sides of our mandate.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range
for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This further
recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor
market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more
neutral stance over time.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that reducing policy strain—restraint too quickly could hinder progress on
inflation.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic
Page 2 of 23

activity and employment.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and
the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are not on any preset course.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy remains strong and inflation is
not sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If the
labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than
anticipated, we can move more quickly.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and
uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</span> <small>(0.783)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that our
affect—actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.635)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we
do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to our discussion.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given the expectation that the election outcome will
produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the
Committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the
next one in December?</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive
the Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next Administration?</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 3 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no
effects on our policy decisions.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and
anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to
forecast, looking out past the very near term.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Here, we don’t know what the timing and
substance of any policy changes will be.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We therefore don’t know what the effects on the
economy would be—specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the
achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t—we
don’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, just in principle, it’s possible that
any Administration’s policies or, or policies put in place by Congress could have economic
effects over time—over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So,
we—along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in
our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel.</span> <small>(0.751)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.801)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Roughly
one year ago when the 10-year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30-year mortgage rates
were near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh
on economic activity.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Given that you’ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now
dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today
any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above
your target?</span> <small>(0.406)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would just say this.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve watched the, the run-up in bond
rates, and it’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago.</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess that, you know, the long-
Page 4 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
run rates are well below that level.</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re watching that.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Things have been moving around,
and we’ll see where they settle.</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s too early to really say where they settle.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Ultimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I
certainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I will say,
though, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way
of downside risks.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what they’re about.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we do take financial conditions into account.</span> <small>(0.764)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If they—if they’re persistent
and if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy.</span> <small>(0.716)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would say
we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just something that we’re watching.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
again, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other
factors in the economy.</span> <small>(0.770)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up—is the September SEP—are those rate
projections still valid?</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?</span> <small>(0.383)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know what?</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between
the last set and the next set.</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The NIPA
revision was stronger.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October
report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger.</span> <small>(0.358)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of,
of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the
NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I
think we would factor that in.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
At the same time, we got one inflation report, which was—it wasn’t terrible, but it was—
it was a little higher than expected.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, really, the question is, is December.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you
know, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report,
two more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we
get to December.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</span> <small>(0.779)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.788)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically
as you try to make that decision?</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then, as of the Fed’s economic projections in September,
you, you had written down four quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2025.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you still think that
those are likely?</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted?</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if it
shifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of, of detail as to why?</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I can’t.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,
and I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I can’t really speak for kind of
exactly where the—where the Committee is.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would just say, for December, we’re going to
be—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that
affects the outlook.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at
5.33 percent.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re, we’re asking
ourselves, “Is that where we need to be?”</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between
the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too
slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re trying to, to be on a middle
path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress
Page 6 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
on inflation.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think that’s where we are, but that’s the question we’re going to be asking in
September and, and in other meetings.</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, I can’t really update you on the Committee’s
thinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yes, total—totally appreciate that.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess when it comes to your
own thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a
reasonable outlook?</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, I’m going to wait—we’re going to wait and see how things
come in in December.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I—it’s just—I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more
neutral stance.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and that’s very much what we’re on.</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That has not changed at all since
September.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Obviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say
that, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know,
where the Committee would be.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wondered if you
could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement
here in the first paragraph when you say, “Inflation has made progress,” dropping the word
“further progress,” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Not really, no.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let me tell you what we were thinking.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the test
of gaining further confidence was a—was our test for the first rate cut, right?</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we, we met
that test in September, and therefore we take that test out.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you leave it in, then it’s new
forward guidance.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s brand new forward guidance. “</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What do you mean by it?</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you—are
you making—are you requiring yet further guidance?”</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have to say “yes” or “no” at every
meeting whether we’ve made further progress.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The point is we have gained confidence that, that we’re on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, I would tell you, is, is what that’s really all about.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s not meant to send
a signal.</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neither of those is meant to send a further signal.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, saying “further
progress” it becomes a test where we don’t want to be—we don’t think it’s a good time to be
doing a lot of, of forward guidance.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’re—there’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that—in what I’ve said.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
path that we’re on, we do know what—where the destination is, but we don’t know the right
pace, and we don’t know exactly where the destination is.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the—the—the point is to find that,
to find the right pace and the right destination as we go.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think there’s a fair amount of
uncertainty about that, and, you know, you don’t want to tie yourself up with, with guidance.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we don’t comment on fiscal policy, and, again, I don’t have a lot
more to say on, on what’s driving bond yields.</span> <small>(0.628)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of, of policy changes, though, let me
give you a sense of how this, this works in the ordinary case.</span> <small>(0.800)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s say Congress is considering a
rewrite of the tax laws; it doesn’t matter what’s in the content.</span> <small>(0.784)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we would follow that.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At a
certain point, we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we’d start to model it.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then we’d wait,
and we’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “This
is—these are the likely effects.”</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy
changes on various parts of the economy.</span> <small>(0.862)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’d, we’d try to get smart on that.</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then the
law actually passes, and, you know, you’d start to put it—you’d probably run an alternative
simulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then, then when it
actually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things.</span> <small>(0.739)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, these—we have a very large economy.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many things are affecting it at any
given time.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but—it would go in,
but it would—you know, it’s a process that takes some time.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Clearly, the legislative process
takes a lot of time.</span> <small>(0.838)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, the real question is not the effect of that law.</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s all of the
policy changes that are happening.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the
economy at any given time?</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that
we go through all the time with every Administration, constantly.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I just—this will be no
different.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, right now, we’re—there’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right
now.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s such an early stage.</span> <small>(0.557)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know what the policies are, and once we know what

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could just follow up on Nick’s question—are the current rates
something you feel like you need to lean against, in that they go against the direction of policy
by being—adding restriction to the economy?</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—look, I just think—the first question is, how long will they be
sustained?</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you remember the 5 percent 10-year, people were drawing massively important

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but
right now it’s not a major factor in, in how we’re thinking about things.</span> <small>(0.681)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris.</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You
mentioned the positive economic data that we’ve seen since the September meeting, including
the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth.</span> <small>(0.410)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We saw a stock market jump yesterday.</span> <small>(0.784)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this—with this
backdrop?</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest
economic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But, of
course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with
today’s cut, policy is still restrictive.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how
Page 10 of 23

restrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if you look at our goal variables, the labor
market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially
in balance.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further
cooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s the labor market.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and
we judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So the job’s not
done on inflation.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was
appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision
is really another step in that process.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an
appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even
as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Great.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just to follow up, could you—what might
cause you to pause rate cuts in December?</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What kind of economic data would lead you to that
path?</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
we’re—so we’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down—our stance down over
time to a more neutral level.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to
adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, for
example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more
quickly.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may
turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you—
you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT.</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
Page 11 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so, you know, it—we’re thinking about it that way, but it’s, it’s something that we’re just
beginning to think about.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So with, with this noise in the jobs
reports that we’ve seen and you look at the Fed’s favorite inflation, PCE inflation, overall it’s
2.1 percent—very close to the Fed’s target—but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it’s been that
way since July.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So why doesn’t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting
the 12-month.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look at all of them, right?</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re
around 2.3 percent.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look at all of them.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we expect there to
be bumps.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings
were very, very low—probably unsustainably low.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts
generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the other hand, the January
reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
there will literally be a bump up and then down.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 12 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say,
“What’s—what is the inflation story now?</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Where is it coming from?”</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I point to a couple of
things.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that—
of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained
2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So they’re back at that level.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s not is housing services.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let’s talk about housing services.</span> <small>(0.791)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Housing services is higher.</span> <small>(0.781)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s going on there
is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation.</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what’s
happening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to
where market, market leases are—market rent leases are.</span> <small>(0.688)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s just a catch-up problem.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s
not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s, that’s one thing.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary
pressures.</span> <small>(0.370)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Where is it coming from?</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not a very tight economy.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What is the story about
inflation?</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re
seeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent
with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and
settling around 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data
months, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re
this far into the process.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you’re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you
see, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>

need to be in a hurry to get there.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We are seeing strong economic activity.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are seeing
ongoing strength in the labor market; we’re watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining
strength there.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is
carefully, patiently.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, that’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we—to the
extent—to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of
that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Craig.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CRAIG TORRES.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Craig Torres from Bloomberg.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Two questions
today.</span> <small>(0.737)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election
results?</span> <small>(0.763)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First question.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and
I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum-employment side of the
mandate, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One of the
broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Compensation
gains are sliding back.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading
down to that bad neighborhood of the 20-teens.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole
saying any “further cooling” is unwelcome.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is cooling, generally, a little bit further.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So at
what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?</span> <small>(0.387)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything
that relates directly or indirectly to the election.</span> <small>(0.661)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the second one, you’re—you know, this is
the great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’ll just say a couple things.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 14 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
You know, there’s nothing really surprising here.</span> <small>(0.684)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What we know is that the
unemployment rate is low.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We also know that it’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up
significantly from a year or so ago.</span> <small>(0.367)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sometimes that has meant bad things.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So far, it doesn’t appear to be.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It appears that the—I
wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very
gradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And our policy, of course, is designed to keep
it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further
progress on inflation.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right.</span> <small>(0.635)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, the, the
openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would—I would characterize it more
broadly as “normalizing.”</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned wages.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Wages are still running just a bit above where
they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to
remain at this high level.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at
these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So I would say—in fact, you can
say it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given
current productivity readings.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high
readings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend.</span> <small>(0.697)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That
has always been the case for 50 years.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If
you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set
of productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, overall, it’s a good labor
market.</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We could talk about 20 different data series.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 15 of 23

But, you know, we don’t want the labor market to, to soften much from here.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We don’t think we
need that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some of the President-elect’s
advisers have suggested that you should resign.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If he asked you to leave, would you go?</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you follow up on is—do you think that legally that you’re not
required to leave?</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You talk
a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in terms of
forward-looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials
around the country?</span> <small>(0.870)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What did you hear today from the regional Bank presidents about what
companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than
looking backwards?</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you
think the appropriate policy path should be?</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of
discussions we had, and, of course, you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would
say this.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the
CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive,
feeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer
Page 16 of 23

November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking
about.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So they feel like the labor market’s in balance.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People feel good about where the economy is.</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Demand is obviously pretty strong.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
you know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Maybe the
year is 2½. This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s actually remarkable how
well the U.S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor
market, inflation coming down.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, you know, really performing better than any of our
global peers.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think that is reflected in what you hear from—what I hear people hear from
CEOs.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from
those.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that, and it’s pretty
constructive overall.</span> <small>(0.690)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, that’s not to say—there are areas of caution and things like that but,
ultimately, overall pretty positive.</span> <small>(0.557)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on
the horizon that you identified as something you’re watching, what would they be?</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks
around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the U.S.
economy.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about
those as, you know, something that’s on the horizon all the time.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, ultimately, if
you look at the U.S. economy, its, its performance has been very good.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And that’s, that’s what
we hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue.</span> <small>(0.347)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If anything, people feel next
year—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just
wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Your predecessors Greenspan and
Volcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial—
economic or financial stability.</span> <small>(0.779)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Will you do that, too?</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, right now, we’re in a period of full
employment.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have large budget deficits and debt at historic, historic highs that are—and
rising.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that something you’d speak out against?</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the
predecessors you mentioned have said.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal—federal
government’s fiscal path—fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The level of our debt
relative to the economy is not unsustainable.</span> <small>(0.810)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The path is unsustainable.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we see that.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And,
you know, you’ve got a very large deficit at—you’re at full employment, and that’s expected to
continue.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it’s important that we—you know, that that be dealt with.</span> <small>(0.382)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is ultimately a threat
to the economy.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, I can say that.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t have oversight.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t have oversight over
fiscal policy.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess the only other question is—to
follow up on Victoria’s question—do you believe the President has the power to fire or demote
you, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other
Governors with leadership positions?</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Courtenay Brown from Axios.</span> <small>(0.743)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In response
to Howard’s question, you said it wasn’t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the
economic uncertainties.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not
it includes some of the proposals that the President-elect has put out on the campaign trail—
tariffs, for instance?</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at
all, nor will I today.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I
mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess I should start by saying
that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very
good place.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?”</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And one risk is that
we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes
back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we have to avoid
that risk.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully.</span> <small>(0.358)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The other
risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do
unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.</span> <small>(0.393)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that says, “Don’t
get behind the curve.”</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so
we’re, we’re in the middle there.</span> <small>(0.686)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage
both of those.</span> <small>(0.797)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor
market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,
enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so there’s—you know, there—
this is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right
path is.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>

You know, it’s not as important—the precise timing of these things is not as important as
the overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of
neutral, a more neutral policy.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I know you don’t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look
at the breakevens, it, it is clear that longer-term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at
about 2.5 percent, for example, on the five-year.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s up half a point from when you cut in

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you have any concern at all that longer-term inflation expectations are

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I
looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s
just—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE
inflation.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, overall,
expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with
2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow
inflation expectations to drift upward.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in
2022 was, was to avoid that.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just talked
about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans
are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets.</span> <small>(0.814)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what’s your message to them
on when they might expect relief?</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So you’re right that, you know, we say that the economy is
performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,
for example.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock, and
inflation went up everywhere.</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, you know, it, it stays with you because the price level
doesn’t come back down.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people
to feel better.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think we’re well
on the road to creating that.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has come way down.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy is still strong here.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wages are moving up
but, but at a sustainable level.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening
and, for the most part, has happened.</span> <small>(0.373)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain
their confidence and feel that.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about
the economy.</span> <small>(0.733)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those feelings are true;
they’re accurate.</span> <small>(0.719)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t question them.</span> <small>(0.557)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—you know, we respect them.</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just a quick follow-up—President-elect Trump has been

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What is your plan if we start to see stagflation?</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so
we don’t have to deal with it.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s our—that is actually our plan. [</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Laughter] You know,
it’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with
interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the
employment mandate.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I would just say that, you know, we’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a
whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in
unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So knock on wood, we’ve
gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we believe we can
complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is
exactly what we’re trying to do.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year?</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t rule anything out or in that far away.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s
certainly not, not our plan.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I mean, our baseline expectation is that we’ll continue to move
gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and
that the labor market will remain strong.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at our—look at our—that will not change
from the September SEP.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, that is our baseline forecast.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, short of some
exogenous event, it will—that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—
but, ultimately, you know, it’s—we’re not in a—we’re not in a world where we can afford to
rule, rule things out a full year in advance.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—there’s just too much uncertainty in what we
do.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wanted to go
back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the
cumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path
to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal
under the average inflation-targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up?</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s not the way our framework works.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re aiming
for inflation at, at 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re—we do not have—we do not think it would be appropriate
to deliberately undershoot.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be
a problem, too, in a way.</span> <small>(0.348)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s not part of our framework, and it’s not something we’re
