Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our, our goals over the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state and remains solid.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To that end, today, the Federal Open
Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by
lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also decided to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a—at a solid
pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the
second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in
equipment and intangibles has strengthened.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been
weak.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.
economy over the past year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants
generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over
the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate is
higher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nominal

wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Overall, a
broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in
2019.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median
projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and
4.3 percent over the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and
2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thereafter, the median
projection falls to our 2 percent objective.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on
both sides of our mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds
rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼-4½ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral
setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing
further progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With today’s action, we
have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is
Page 2 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now significantly less restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further
adjustments to our policy rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on
inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In considering the extent and timing of additional
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not on any preset course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their
individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each
participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median participant projects
that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and
3.4 percent at the end of 2026.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These median projections are somewhat higher than in
September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These projections, however, are not a
Committee plan or decision.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If the economy remains strong and inflation
does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more
slowly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly
than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Policy is well positioned to deal with the
risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility
to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate—its typical configuration.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 3 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, and I look forward to your
questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you for taking
our questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’s appropriate
to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what
would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Would a January cut potentially be
possible, or does a pause next month seem more likely?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and
then—and then move to 2025.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it
was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of
our goals, maximum employment and price stability.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We see the risks as two-sided: moving too
slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly
and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re trying to steer between those two
risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I’ll give you some
details on why.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 4 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is
now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and
orderly way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to
2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold
unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as
surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor
market than there was, than we had in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s still quite gradually cooling.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, we keep an
eye on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we’ve
made a great deal of progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November
is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Twelve—but 12-month inflation
has actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we
might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for
goods.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent
and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at
which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You ask about 2025.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year
really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that
inflation will be higher.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we
see as higher.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think
the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We’re, we’re going to react to data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks
is likely to be appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you
make those cuts?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this
way: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re significantly closer to
neutral.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But as
for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as
continued strength in the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And as long as the economy and the labor market are
solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And all of that is reflected—to
your question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next
year, compared to four in September.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the
opportunity to ask you a question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the
last transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in
part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s
the split on this one?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in,
and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I’d say—I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start—let
me start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place, and we think policy’s in a
really good place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that
Page 6 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation has come down by 50 percent to, to—from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Headline
inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re actually in a really good starting place here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First
thing is growth is stronger, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so
far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next
year as well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants
think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that’s, that’s more
strength, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation is higher, as we talked about.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation’s higher this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s also higher in the
forecast next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another
reason to be cautious about, about further moves.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And—but then getting to your—to your point,
there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some
people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of
economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some
people said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we
have people making a bunch of different approaches to that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But some did identify policy
uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the
path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking
into a dark room full of furniture.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You just slow down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that may have affected some of
the people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 7 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and
uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The upside risk to inflation jumped quite
substantially.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the
disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The only
real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Is it fair to say that that’s what’s
driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What’s happened
is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in
September.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, November is, is back on track.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, once again we’ve, you know,
we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached
the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I can tell you that
might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to
expectations.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent].</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s way below
where it was.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I
mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s
in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing
inflation down and keeping a solid labor market.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRIS RUGABER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking
the question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking
Page 8 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through” any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations
remained anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other
thinking on tariffs generally that you can share?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative
simulations are a good place to start.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I happened to have brought them here with me today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m
sure you have them too.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you
know, it’s six-years-old analysis.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right
questions to ask.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing
through,” one was not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see-
through” paragraph.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to
“see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not
be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we won’t face that
question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What the Committee’s doing now is, is
discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can
affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, we’re,
we’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it
puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make,
you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy
response.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Do you, given the recent bout
of inflation that we’ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and
businesses being—seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a
Page 9 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
little bit riskier to look through tariffs?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, are—do you feel that you have to respond more
quickly to inflation threats, given what we’ve seen the past few years?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative
simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs
will, will even go into consumer inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How persistent will that be?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, so, we
just—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very
premature to try to make any kind of conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what
countries, for how long, and what size.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know,
retaliatory tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be
into consumer prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last
episode is or is not a good model for what happened.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You pointed out we’ve just been through a
period of high inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve just gotten through that period.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a difference.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was also
quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that
may have affects.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a
very careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how
they’re implemented.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re at the
stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions,
but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, to make sure
I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the
central tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the
Page 10 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if inflation only declines next
year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let me—let me find these numbers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we have—we have inflation
coming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’d be—that’d
be significant progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You see a slower path.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that does take on board that we want to
see real progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation
down to that level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you
know, better than this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That would be meaningful.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We,
we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And while we, we have the
labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very
gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s also something we need to keep our
eye on.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these
projections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing” language in the statement, which has
been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it’s going to be on hold for a
while, and they said, “Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,” would they
be mistaken to, to infer that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at
all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let me explain “extent and timing.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if
the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate
to slow the pace of rate cuts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can
reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Clearly, that distance has
shrunk by 100 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s significantly smaller.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s the “extent” question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 11 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And, again, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor
market, to make those cuts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">“Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy
develops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of
adjustments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, that’s what we mean by that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not trying to make decisions about the
longer run.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, I
just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that
we expect significant policy changes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s nothing really unusual about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we need
to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll, we’ll have a
much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Even
though you’ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven’t seen much change in
mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You say you’re significantly restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you
running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of
a slowdown than you anticipate?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are,
are really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,
but they’re also affected by many other things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And longer rates have actually gone up quite a
bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example,
mortgage rates more than short-term rates do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look at that, but we look at all financial
conditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what we see happening in
the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth
Page 12 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for a very long time, and it keeps not happening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we have—we’re now well into another year
of growth.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It looks like it might be 2½ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Third and—second and third quarters were right
about at the same level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Substantially
better than our global peer group.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I—there’s no reason to think a downturn is, is any
more likely than it—than it usually is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We have to stay on task, though, and
continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re also
going to be looking out for the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We want to keep the labor market pretty close to
where it is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Job
creation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so
that’s what our policy’s trying to achieve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up by asking about—your formulation for
beginning rate cuts included the phrase “we need to have confidence that inflation is moving
down towards our target.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Given the fact that you’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you
have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve
made—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re, you
know, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than
that, we have been—for headline inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has
come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why
that portends well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You, again, you do see with housing
services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down
now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s
Page 13 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
nonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate
better with, you know, new leases that turn over.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Not, not new tenants, but new leases.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Market
rents is new leases.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it
was before the pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way
because of used cars and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we think, overall, that should generally be in the
range it was in.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are
in, in good shape.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed
rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much
about the, you know, about tightness in the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">They don’t really reflect that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, a
good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that,
that’s how that inflation works.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s, it is cooler by so many measures
now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So
it’s not a source of inflationary pressures.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know,
particular professions where labor is tight.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses
of any significance from the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what’s the story?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that
the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in
insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing
insurance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we and most
other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It might
Page 14 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take another year or two from here, but I, I’m confident that that’s the path we’re on.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So the
unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level
that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the
50 basis point cut in September.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But now
the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what has changed
about the Committee’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Is there just less
concern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now
needs to be accounted for?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in
July: 4.2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And job creation is, is
lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s been
steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would
hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you might—you might—if,
if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that
level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of
thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So gradually declining.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We, we do think the
labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s, it’s not
cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, you know, you pointed
out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative
Page 15 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it
doesn’t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, you know, we’re
watching it closely.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the
labor market is welcome here, what’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get
to 2 percent inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t need it, we
don’t think.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few
months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent
months been moving sideways in the 12-month window.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’ve got to weigh them both,
at this point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused
on, on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we
think are broadly, roughly in balance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that’s how we think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word “recalibration”
today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this
new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it
was before.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we may get
around to that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I
said.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis
points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re significantly closer to neutral.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We still think where we are is meaningfully,
meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move
Page 16 of 28

cautiously and look for progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support
economic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that’s a good thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I think it would—I
support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think from now we are
in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it is kind of a new thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We moved pretty quickly
to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is
consistent with, with the SEP.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the
Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we’ve had in the recent inflation
numbers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the
avian flu, that, that kind of stuff.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation
coming down, as it did in the recent report.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the
numbers we don’t like, you know?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], “Look, those
high months are wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What about the low months?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ve got, we have a very
low month, potentially, in November.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens
for core PCE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that could be idiosyncratically low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We try to look—we try to look at not just
a couple or three months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We shouldn’t have—our, our position shouldn’t change based on two
or three months of good or bad data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We have a long string now of inflation coming down
gradually over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it’s 12-month headline’s 2½; 12-month
core is 2.8.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s way better than we were.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We still have some work to do, though, is how
we’re looking at it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get—to get that work done,
we think.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks Chair, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin from Axios.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Financial markets
have been very buoyant, really all year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is the Committee comfortable with where financial
conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine
progress on your inflation target?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s
part of what we do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our—
of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what we’ve seen over the
course of—just take the last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of
years—come down a lot.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That suggests that
our policy is restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected
by—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Housing activity is, is very low,
and that’s partly, significantly because of our policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we think our policy is working.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s
transmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, a
lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the
places where we’d expect to see it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do
you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, we, we’re not allowed to own Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Federal
Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re, we’re not looking for a, a law change.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the
kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.</span></p>

MICHELLE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Andrew.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">ANDREW ACKERMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’re confident
that we’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years
ago.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s pretty clear we’ve avoided a recession.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think growth
this year has, has been solid, it really has.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which
we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real
growth] this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is a really good number.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, the U.S. economy has just been
remarkable.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the
story, is that how well the U.S. is doing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if you look around the world, there’s just a lot of
slow growth and continued struggles with inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I feel—I feel very good about where the
economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the—you, you
guys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">However, employment rates have
fallen rather quickly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point—half a
percent, rather—recently.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The question, I guess, is, do you think there’s maybe more downside
momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think so, no.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age
participation is still very high.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is
low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you are looking
for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come
Page 19 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further
softening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I didn’t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in
the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the
action, with, with an additional cut.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is
very low—again, participation is high.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable
level—wage growth.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you
know, we want to keep it that way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Amara.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">AMARA OMEOKWE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just
want to put a finer point on the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Can you keep the labor market this way, in the
strong position that you have described, without further cuts?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In other words, do you still view
the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I,
I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in
balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, job creations are, are
meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be
sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you, if you take into account
the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to
2 percent inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the
downsides clearly appear to have diminished.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals,
Page 20 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually
cooling—gradually and in an orderly way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, that’s, that’s how I would
characterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks so much, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Elizabeth Schulze from ABC
News.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As you’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">High prices are
still a burden for so many households right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Why do you think it is that inflation is proving
to be more stubborn than you’d expected?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it
just has been a little bit more stubborn.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think if you go back two or three years, many people
were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you
know, high unemployment by now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path
down has actually been much better than many predicted.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We, we’ve managed to, to have the
unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come
down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a
12-month basis.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why hasn’t it come down [more]?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around
the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents
have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two
years ago.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s part of it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I
think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So we, we
understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s
Page 21 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s
tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This was everywhere in all the
advanced economies at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but
people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The best
we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and
keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their
wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year
upon year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what it
will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the
biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly,
I’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place; our
policy’s in a really good place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I expect another good year next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward
Lawrence from Fox Business.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you say that we’re closer to the neutral rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What percent do
you see, and the Committee believes—where is that neutral rate?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’ll say a couple things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First of all, when we, when we write—
the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate,
which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in
balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is not where we are right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So when
we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you can’t do a
Page 22 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
straight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the
appropriate policy should be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the
economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and
we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s
having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are
lasting but not permanent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually
affect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re
looking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say,
we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points
closer to it right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot
closer to it, and I think we’re in a good place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re
going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little
more clarity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I, I think
the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where
that, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models
of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There, there are empirical models,
there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different
answers as you’d like.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there is no real certainty.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing
to know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh,
Page 23 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I think this model or this estimate is right.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You, you just have to be open to, you know, the
empirical data that are coming in and also how it’s affecting the outlook.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s not made any
easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s
appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to,
to neutral, and we’ll do so.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these
cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make
progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">VICTORIA GUIDA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just wanted to make sure I
understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Are you saying that progress
on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then also,
since that’s what’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Why, why do
you all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is
headline inflation, because that’s what people experience.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People don’t experience core
inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s the overall
goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can
fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really
good predictors of future inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of
overall inflation than overall inflation is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look at core inflation because it’s a better
measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of
Page 24 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what inflation pressures exist.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s—it’s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know,
our goal is headline, not core.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So your question was, your second question was what?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially
ticking up?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and
food prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with
forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year,
then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it—that, that’s why
the two can go in different directions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year,
but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything
about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’re thinking about
energy prices?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know,
but—really carefully, rather.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven’t really—
nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States
economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking
about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary
statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the price of
oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we

don’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly,
at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it remains, you know, a risk.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Kelly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">KELLY O’GRADY.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Kelly O’Grady from CBS News.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I want to
go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
wasn’t the case for some time, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s partly why Americans haven’t felt much relief in
their wallets from prices yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in
closing that gap could go away?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months
of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we, what we had was—we had
four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then
November is much lower.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising
upside risk to inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, I think inflation is much lower.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">What the public is feeling, and they’re
right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your,
your real compensation is growing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in other words, your compensation’s growing
meaningfully faster than inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just
want to hold onto it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what’s
going on right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation
really signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You
previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s now been pushed out to
Page 26 of 28

2027.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You said you’re focused on enabling further progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s not necessarily
progress in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you confident that target isn’t going to move further out?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you
know, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Very high
uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently
predict where the economy is going to be in three years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what we’re doing is we’re looking at
what’s happening now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are
happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods
and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their,
their prior level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces
come together.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s every reason to think that they will.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The timing of it is highly uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit
frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, we’re still on track.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d
said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people
would be, would say, “I’ll take that.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Job’s
not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Go to Nancy for the last question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy Marshall-Genzer from
Marketplace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it
appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you think the Fed is just going to
have to settle for that and accept that you’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 27 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, we’re not going to settle for that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think we’re, we’re, you
know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we’ll get inflation back
sustainably to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is—and I am confident we will achieve that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has taken longer,
but it’s, you have to be—you know, we are making progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have made a great deal of
progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we owe
the public.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, we’re committed to achieving it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’re at 4.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">That’s, that’s
meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make
progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—Thank you very much.</span></p>
