Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 1, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon, everyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Welcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain
squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain
strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that
tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full
effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given how far we have come,
along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will
make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain
restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and
well above earlier expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an
outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>After picking up
somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Higher interest rates also
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the
supply of workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic
levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined
so far this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the
supply of available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Total PCE prices rose
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has moderated since the middle of last
year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But a few months of good data are
only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down
sustainably toward our goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a
long way to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain
well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecastters, as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
Page 2 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our restrictive
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are
confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand
for labor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is
no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further
tightening of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher
longer-term bond yields, among other factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Because persistent changes in financial conditions
can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments
closely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is
proceeding carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation as well as the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In determining the extent of additional policy firming
Page 3 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring
price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices
over the longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell,
for doing this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To what—you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields—to what degree did
that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for your question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want
to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, if
you—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has been coming
down, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market has been
rebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>GDP growth has been strong, although
many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
As for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that’s
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we’re not confident yet
that we have achieved such a stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that is the broader context into which this, this strong
economy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of
rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields
and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the
path of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming]
from higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower
equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that is something
that remains to be seen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s critical.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not
what we’re looking for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are
material.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t
simply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we
didn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, and I would say on
that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the
increase in longer-term rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is
that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households
and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this
tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,
Page 5 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
which could have pretty significant effect on housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how I would answer your
question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this: In your opening
statement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions
are restrictive enough to finish the fight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that true?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s exactly right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, to say it a different way: We
haven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have not made a determination,
and we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—that is—the
way we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the
extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to
2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you so much for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I
wonder, you know, if you don’t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at
that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting
rate increases next year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about
September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re asking a hypothetical there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll
get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on
economic activity, and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation, the broader financial
condition situation and broader world situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be looking at all those things as we make
a decision in December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We haven’t made that decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I would say, though, that, that the idea that if you—the idea that would—difficult to raise
again after stopping for a meeting or two, it’s just not right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, the Committee will always
do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about—
at all about December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December
today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, did the Fed
staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today’s meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening
is persistent?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the
spring.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is it here on something that’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar
to simulate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the
recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the answer is “no.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the
minutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity
we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be
doing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can see
how volatile it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an
estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very
quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you
can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 7 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And over time, that will have an effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just don’t know how persistent it’s going to be, and
it’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I’d be comfortable communicating into how many
rate hikes that is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident—what
makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above-trend growth when
500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and
sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you
raise interest rates, you do see those effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you see those effects in the economy now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You see what’s happening in the housing market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re seeing that now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ll see, if you
look at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds
because rates are so high now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the
effects of this—of this could be quite significant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This has been a resilient
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there are a number of possible
reasons why that may be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,
and so we take the economy as it comes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMTH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of the
thresholds that you’ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence
of persistently above-trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market
tightness—that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike
would be necessary.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m just curious if that’s how the Committee sees it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 8 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ve identified those factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those were not meant to be the
only factors or a specific test that we’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Really, we’re going to be looking at the broader picture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, what’s happening with our
progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Is the labor market continuing to, broadly, cool off
and achieve a better balance?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be looking at that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, growth—we look at growth
insofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We look at that, and we look at broader
financial conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you
know, whether we need to further tighten policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, if we do reach that judgment, then we
will further tighten policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if
that is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates,
what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could we see those maybe pulled
forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts
right now at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not talking about rate cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re still very focused on the first question,
which is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is the question we’re focusing on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Will policy remain
restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident
that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’ll be the next question, but
honestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question of rate cuts
just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you
know, as close to right as you can.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that
there was a tightening bias in the Committee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You say in the statement you’re looking to assess
the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There were forecasts for two rate
hikes among most members of the Committee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But then you just said that, you know, we
don’t—we haven’t made a determination.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there
is no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for
two hikes?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, one additional—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say that at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say—I mean, the language,
looking at it here, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate
to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s the question we’re asking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the Committee
here?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question
we’re asking is, should we hike more?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and
you’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know—and
we’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, since the last
meeting, the auto workers’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet, on the other
hand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do you see all those factors,
taken together, affecting the economy going forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How are you thinking about those?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 10 of 27

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, there are significant issues out there, as you point out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Global
geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that goes for the war in Ukraine; it goes for the
war between Israel and Hamas.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re monitoring that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our job is to monitor those things for
their economic implications.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to
an end.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Oil prices have flattened out; they haven’t gone down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess they’ve gone down a
little bit from their earlier peak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we
don’t know about that one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s plenty of risk out there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I would go back to—the
bigger picture from our standpoint is, we’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market,
making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re very focused on
getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently
restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s really our focus.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just one quick thing: You, last month, had gone to
York, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of—or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot
of small business owners.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you
pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of
what they talked about?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was very impressed by
York as a town with a real strategy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there
have put together in the face of, you know, some difficult longer-run trends about offshoring of
manufacturing and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’ve done a great job as a city, I think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know,
what you hear—and it’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You were there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We talked to some people who, you know, were feeling that in their
businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s
Page 11 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
painful for people—particularly people who don’t have a lot of extra financial resources who are
spending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That wasn’t new.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in
York, and, you know, I walked away from that even—you know, I mean, just thinking that we
really—the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability—fully restore price
stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage
we can.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for
the economy in order to get inflation down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But since the economy has not responded to rate
hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all—on
how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall
growth?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been
able to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the same is true of growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And growth has been
strong, but yet we’re still seeing this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I
think still believe, that is likely to be true.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely
that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor
market conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but it’s only a good
Page 12 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
thing that we haven’t seen it, and I think we know why.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, since, since we lifted off,
we, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One of them—one of
which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the
pandemic and the response to the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary
policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space
to recover.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But it’s
that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower
growth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and
bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in
the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of
why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, we welcome that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think,
and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Against that backdrop, if you’ve gotten any clarity on lags—if you
have an economy that’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that
there isn’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that&#39;s still coming through the pipeline and
that it may have already come into effect?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s been one
year at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s a
full year since then.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this
year—we’re seeing it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you can, for
Page 13 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
example—an example where you wouldn’t have felt this yet is, is debt that had been termed out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and there
are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I
don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags
are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is
really not a good way to do it.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process
down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it takes time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know that, and you can’t rush it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better
sense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m
trying to connect the dots here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel’s question
is, you said you need slower growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You had always said before a period of lower-than-trend
growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Has that changed?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, two, it sounds to me like you’re basically saying here that kind
of the dot plot’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase
for right now—doesn’t matter about the turn of the year—and that there’s not an objective way
to determine whether or not you’ve got enough tightening in the system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just going to be a
subjective judgment, meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the dot plot is a picture
in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in
light of their own personal economic forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s
not, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a forecast that would
change, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I
Page 14 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wouldn’t write down that dot six weeks later.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Think of the number of things that could change
your mind on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three-month
period between that meeting and the next meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, nonetheless, it’s out there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t—
we do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, I
think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be—
my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was
“below potential.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily—
potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So the right way to
think about it is, what’s potential growth this year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People think trend growth over a long period
of time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what we’ve
had is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned,
through both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning
in the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and
shortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>There’s
catch-up growth that can happen in potential.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that means that if you’re growing—you could
be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output
of the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I hope that’s clear.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s really what’s going on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s why I would say it as
below potential.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by
meeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting
Page 15 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at
each meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s
characterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, we’re going meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive
to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re looking
at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we
look at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking
cycle, very far.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a
relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re close to the—to
the end of the cycle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not a
promise or a plan of the future.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’re going into these meetings one by one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re
looking at the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re proceeding
carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Monetary policy is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see
its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how I think
about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of the run-up
in long-term yields we’ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the
pace of your asset runoff program?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if there were judgment that higher—that the higher-
term premium was endangering the dual-mandate goals, would that be reason to think about
slowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around
reserves?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance
sheet runoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not something we’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many
candidate explanations for why rates have been going up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And QT is certainly on that list.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it’s
not—I think—I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s not something that we’re—that we’re looking at right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask about the Basel
III Endgame capital proposal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve gotten a lot of “pushback” from people on different
aspects of the proposal, and you yourself expressed some reservations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m just curious:
Could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, that proposal is out for comment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we expect a lot of
comment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
we’ve extended the deadline.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ll take them seriously.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll read them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll say what,
what I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It means broad support.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, in addition to persistence,
when you look at long-term Treasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those
tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further
tightening?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 17 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what do we look at?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We look at a very wide range of financial
conditions and, in fact, as you’ll know, different organizations publish different financial
conditions’ indexes, which can have, you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables,
so there’s a very rich environment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we tend to look at a few of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not going to give
you the names, but, you know, they’re a few of the common ones that people look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so
they’re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates,
the credit spreads.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sometimes they’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn’t
any one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We would never look at, for example, long-term Treasury rates in isolation, nor
would we ignore them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play
a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Your second
question was?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the banking stress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you know,
we, we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in
the March—the things we went through in March and thereafter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’ve been working a
lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that
they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we do think the banking system is quite resilient.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We had, you know, a handful of bank
failures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t have any reason to think
that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong
banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,
on funding, and those sorts of things.</div>

SCOTT HORSLEY.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Scott Horsley from NPR.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Last week you
and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for
comment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there—what it would mean for
merchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of
both debit and credit cards in the—in the payment system?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, so you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We put a proposal out for comment, is
what we did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in
Dodd-Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s all we’re
trying to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What else can we really do?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t
comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we do hope that
stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They
haven’t been shy about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that
now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So for the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core
well over 3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but
with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus
overall inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and
be bumpy, but we’re making progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came
down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the best thing I could point you to would
be the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of
Page 19 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year, on a 12-month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further
into the 2s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So that’s, that’s—if you look historically, that’s, that’s sort of consistent with the
way inflation comes down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get
further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the good news is, you
know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we feel like we’re on a
path to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you’ve said in the past that doing too little on interest
rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How robust
was the debate about this pause on the doing-too-little side?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And we know
that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get
entrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation will be both
more—both higher and more volatile.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so
we’re really committed to not letting that happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, for the first year or so of our
tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, you know, we’re—
we’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can’t
identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Quick follow-up
to the question about banking stresses—you talked about how the banking system is resilient.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of
course, part of the resilience the past year stems from the Bank Term Funding Program that you
launched in March.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are

probably mounting, how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next
year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking
about that yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the
first quarter of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Quick second question about inflation
expectations—the U. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one-year-ahead inflation
expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Last year you said that particular survey was a really
decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If it stays elevated next time around, how big
of an input will that be into your December thinking?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We look at a range of, of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think the, the, the, you
know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was actually a preliminary
estimate that got revised away.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at many, many things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also
market-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between
meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it will—
they’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can always find one
reading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the
public believes that inflation will come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical
in winning the battle.</div>

MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for
taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned
today that you’re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, and you’ve recently said
that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I was curious if you could
elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view, has risen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So first thing to say is that it’s very important.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a very
important variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with
any precision in real time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you have to just take that—you have to take
your estimate of it with a grain of salt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What we know now is, you know, within a range of
estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on
economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we do—we do talk about this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s not any
debate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or
not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Ultimately, it’s
unknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and
giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our
moves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down
to 2 percent over time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s the question we’re asking ourselves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think, you know, years
from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to look—we have to have
those models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the
effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 22 of 27

MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up on a wages point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Earlier you talked about
the inflation outlook, but I’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its
current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have—
wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a
level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent
inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s much
closer than it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this
week.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and all of them
are kind of saying that, which is great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you have to look at a group of them because any one
of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what you see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so what
you saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if
you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down
substantially in June.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the
June reading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our
expectations internally, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think we feel good about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Also I would say it isn’t—in my
thinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far,
although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy
becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of
the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too.</div>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Chair
Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you
are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the
concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It was not getting rates high enough in time
to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that was the concern.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still
trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you can see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think, and
I think, that the risks are getting more balanced.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more—
closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That range, if
you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re
going to see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates
of a neutral policy rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now that’s arithmetic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the
economy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to
being in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you said the proof is how the economy
reacts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What are you looking at to be sure you’re not overshooting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still
broadly cooling?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where
inflation was clearly cooling and coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and
they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The data have bounced back.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what are we
Page 24 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
seeing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Are we seeing—is inflation still coming down?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s the first thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The second
thing is, in the labor market, what we’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and
demand, partly through just much more supply coming online.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And with labor demand still
clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last
quarter, it’s still very strong demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So—and you see wage increases coming down as we
discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that’s—we want to see that, that
whole set of processes continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Bryan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>BRYAN MENA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Bryan Mena, CNN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you think that there has been any structural
change in either consumption or in the job market that’s pushing at consumption?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You
obviously saw the third-quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect
everyone’s spending to have fizzled out by now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m kind of wondering if there’s been any
structural change in consumption.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
would say it’s certainly been strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so a couple of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We may have underestimated
the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There
may be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount
of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really
at all, or in-person services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think,
although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of
savings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We may not be there yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So things are—clearly, people are still spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than
inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises
Page 25 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
spending, which continues to drive more hiring.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so you’ve had a really—that whole—that
whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off, so that
goods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, from a
business standpoint, there are more people to hire.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And it is more labor supply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the whole
thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s been—you know,
it’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, it’s been a dynamic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question is, how long can that continue?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I just
think this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the
pandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still
learning.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning
about how it plays out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s all we can do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>DANIEL AVIS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel–Hamas conflict.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel–Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine
“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained
disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve had
organizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war spreads to
other countries in the region.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments
in the Middle East—you mentioned they are—and just what the potential economic impact could
be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t want to speculate too much, but I’ll just say so—you
know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things
Page 26 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we’re talking about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The price of
oil has really not reacted very much so far to this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As the—you know, as the Fed—as the Federal
Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and
economic effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it isn’t clear, at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going
to—is on track to have significant economic effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly
important and something for people to, you know, to take really important notice of, but it may
or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an
economic body.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “calls out” risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
that’s what it’s doing—[it] is calling out a risk of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the war in Ukraine, the same.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The war in Ukraine did have, immediately, very
significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks very much.</div>
