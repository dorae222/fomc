Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 3, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment
briefly on recent developments in the banking sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Conditions in that sector have broadly
improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will
continue to monitor conditions in the sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are committed to learning the right lessons
from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As a first
step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the
Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The review’s findings
underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and
more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>My
colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly
committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since early last
year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are
also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent
approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will

have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 0.9 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be
modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Activity in the housing sector
remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Higher interest rates and
slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market remains very tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the first three months of the year, job gains
averaged 345,000 jobs per month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at
3.5 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are
coming back into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent
months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has sown—
shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But overall, labor
demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the 12 months
ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle
of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting
inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term
inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re continuing to [carry
out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more
than a year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It will take time,
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to
our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the strains that emerged in the banking
sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and
businesses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The extent of these effects remains uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have
put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In determining the
extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over
time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags
with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial
developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of
Page 3 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we
are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer
run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a
suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I also
wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March
minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they’re envisioning would look and feel like when
it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A, a decision on a pause was not made today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You will
have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the
Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That sentence is,
is not in, in the statement anymore.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in
Page 4 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation
to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we—that’s a—
that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’ll be
driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’ll approach that question at
the June meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not
my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a
modest rate this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different
forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The] staff produces its
own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the
Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think this is a healthy thing—
that the, the staff is writing down what they really think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re not especially influenced by
what the Governors think, and vice versa.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Governors are not taking what the staff says and
just writing that down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can
have different perspectives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I
would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical
in modern-era recessions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible
effects of a debt-limit standoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do
you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what type of situation
would that look like?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:
These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the
Administration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they’re really
consigned to them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling
be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A failure to do that would be unprecedented.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the
consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite
a[d]verse.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll just leave it there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we don’t give advice to either side.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We just would
point out that it—that it’s very important that this be done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the, the other point I’ll make
about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the
potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we—
it’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place
where we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not
paying its bills.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just a follow-up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was discussion around the uncertainty of a
possible standoff—did that affect today’s monetary policy decision at all?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say that it did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was—of course, it’s something that
came up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A
number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say that it was important in
today’s monetary policy decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation
Page 6 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest
rate risks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ve done in the wake of the recent
bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And kind of part 3, but it’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation
principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very
well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I did remember it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
what it was was a general presentation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was an informational briefing of the whole Board—
the entire Board.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think all members were there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it was about interest rate risk in the banks
and, and lots of data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you
know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There
was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it was—I
think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry,
horizontal assessment of, of banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming
situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I
thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many
banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the
events of, of early March, to build liquidity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you asked about the separation principle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—
you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the
financial stability tools are not in conflict.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re both—they’re working well together.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve
used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, at the
Page 7 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
same time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment
and price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, I’m sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t mean to be argumentative, but
the, the staff report said, “SVB . . .</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>has significant interest rate risk.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It said, “Interest rate risk
measurement[s] . . .</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>failed” at SVB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it said, “Banks with large unrealized losses face
significant safety and soundness risks.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why was that not alarming?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was—they’re
pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you
know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They mentioned
that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters
requiring attention.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that was also in the presentation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it was to say: Yes, this is
a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the
case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask—obviously, with the recent
bank turmoil, we’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I was just curious whether you
think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial
stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even
larger.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to
further consolidate banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking
industry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now there
Page 8 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
are 4,000 and change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s going on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I personally have long felt that having small-,
medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the
community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important
purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think it’s healthy to have a, you
know, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that’s a
positive thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First
Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you know,
there’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it was legitimate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think the
FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would assume
that’s what they did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So do you have any concerns about the fact that they’re, they’re
getting larger in general?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the
largest banks doing big acquisitions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is the policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And—but this is—this is an exception
for a failing bank.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It also
would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the
regional banks bought, bought this company.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that could have been the outcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But,
ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost
bid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now to Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the March
meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be
Page 9 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
equal to one or more rate increases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, given developments since then, how has your estimate
changed?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite
impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, in principle, that’s the
idea.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit,
and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of
broadly similar way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one
and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, ultimately, we
have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But I
think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have
to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The extent of that is so
hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t
know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s, that’s what
we’ll be watching carefully to find out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the
Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains
strong then, if, if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as
we want to find ourselves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent
to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by
meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in
Page 10 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the statement, the obvious factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s really all we can do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad
understanding of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Credit tightening is a different thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a lot of
literature on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even
further uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions—
what’s happening with lending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We get—there’s a lot of data on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’ll,
we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, noting that
the statement dropped the reference to “sufficiently” restricted—“restrictive,” I was wondering,
given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact,
sufficiently restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to need data
to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think
we’ve reached that point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March
meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was—
this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to—
before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you
know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I have a follow-up on credit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you give us a sense of
what the SLOOS survey indicated?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were
Page 11 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
tightening credit as of the, the last survey.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What did this one show, and how did that weigh into
your deliberations?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line
with our usual time frame.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you
see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing
from other sources.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls
that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really
since the second half of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Nick.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, the argument
around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was
to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>After the bank failures in March, as
you’ve discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So my question is
why it was necessary to raise interest rates today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of
slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ve, for the last two
meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to
keep moving?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy
we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of
policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over
time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think slowing
down was the right move.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do
Page 12 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We always have to balance
the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of
maybe slowing down economic activity too much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we thought that this rate hike, along
with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to
Howard’s question—you’ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently
restrictive stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period
than a six-week intermeeting cycle?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment
will be an ongoing one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you
can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Look, look back.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve seen inflation
come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve seen inflation have
a few months of coming down and then come right back up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think you’re going to want to
see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve
got this right, kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis
points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that policy is tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them
many different ways.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable
estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’ve got 2 percent
real rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would,
would assess as, you know, the neutral rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So policy is tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you see that in interest—
interest-sensitive activities.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s
Page 13 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly
even at—that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence with
Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections
show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of
3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our
target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a
question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, ultimately,
we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have a, a goal of getting to
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think it’s going to take some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How does the other side of the mandate—the jobs side—once
you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at
that point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You still got
1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, overall, you’re near a
50-year low in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late
Page 14 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last week, and it’s—whenever it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points
above what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we do
see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These are very positive developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well
above our—well above our goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation
down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MATTHEW BOESLER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed
officials’ projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast
as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I’m just wondering if you
could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’re optimistic that a recession can be avoided,
given that that’s the Fed staff’s forecast—possibly also the broader Committee’s forecast as
well—and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters’.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the
Summary of Economic Projections and all that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you
said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first-
quarter GDP at that point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Anyway,
in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s, it’s
interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the
unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was
when we started.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So job openings are still very, very high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see—by surveys and much,
Page 15 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
much [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s—it really is
different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of
the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, that’s what we’ve seen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
we—there are no promises in this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can
continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment
that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, that would be against history.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I
fully appreciate that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That would be against the, the pattern.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But I do think that it—that this, that
the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are
actually—wages have been moving down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a
good sign—down to a more sustainable level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that—I think it’s still possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—you
know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely
than that of having, having a recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession
is—I don’t rule that out, either.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild
recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still
well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you see that as well?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at a range of wage, wage measures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then
that’s in nominal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases
plus inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation
index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically,
those four and many others.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have
to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They can
Page 16 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deviate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, corporate margins can go up and down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there is a feature of long
expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a
recession—sorry, later in an expansion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, yeah.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The, the—you know, and we calculate those,
and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I would say that what
they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer
to where they need to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take
to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—by the way, I don’t want
to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re asking me a very
specific question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think there are many things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I think wages and prices tend to move together.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know,
that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, you mentioned
profit margins.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And
while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’t
fallen as much as might be expected, given that we’re seeing at least some pullback among
consumer spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a
driver of higher prices?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to
reduced inflation in the coming months?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you
have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or,
or not flexible enough.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we
Page 17 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation
come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of
full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then it’s—then it’s, then
you’re really back to full competition.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you
tell us something about what your policy reaction function is—your policy framework is going
forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data,
which is, by definition, backward looking?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you going to be forecasting what you think is
going to happen?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I didn’t catch the last part.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rolling?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you
rule that out?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Oh, yes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, I got it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, what are we looking
at?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, the whole idea is
to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re always, always
looking at both.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’ll be readings
on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of
those many things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks
now and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are small and
medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on
lending?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’ll, that’ll be an important thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—
Page 18 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are shrinking the
balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but
perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we have to factor all of that in and, and
make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is
challenging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What about the idea of rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is
going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And in that world, if that forecast
is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If you
have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in,
you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s not
our forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation
moves down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved
much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s quite stable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to
weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to
begin to see progress there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate
for us to cut rates.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m curious how you view the
role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you
think it’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to
Page 19 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
compete with banks for deposits?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of
the facility?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It hasn’t actually
been growing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have
really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits
and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home
Loan Banks and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had
been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits
into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What
was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and
spreading them around and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect
overall on the overnight repo facility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re
supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I want to go back to the debt
ceiling for a moment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just
speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the
markets, and borrowing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be—
we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It just—it just

shouldn’t be a thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the
Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally
from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Scott.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SCOTT HORSLEY.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Scott Horsley for NPR.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In his report last
week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the
regulatory—or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt
all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift
towards less aggressive oversight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You were here in 2019.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you share that view, and what
would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be
necessary?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the
work, but I do—I have read it, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I find it persuasive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I would say it this
way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly
and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think
the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened,
and, and identify what we need to do to address that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some of that is—may, it may just have
been technology evolving.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we have to keep up with all that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But some of it may be
our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What our job is now is, identify those
things and implement them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I
feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Evan.</div>

EVAN RYSER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Evan Ryser with MNI Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, are we
in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that what the statement is saying?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There were
three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we—
that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those have now all been resolved, and
all the depositors have been protected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic
kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that
period of, of severe stress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with
credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and
you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized
banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s going
to be the macroeconomic effect of that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully
monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our
decisions in an important way, going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GREG ROBB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Fed Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just
wondered if you’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up
to it over the last—since you’ve been Fed Chairman, I think I’ve heard you say a couple of times
that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you think that was the right way to go
about this?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, yeah, comments on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for
five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’ve learned some
Page 22 of 25

May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
new things as well, and we need to do better.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was
unflinching and appropriately so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I welcome it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I agree with and will support those
recommendations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster
measures that will address the problems.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know,
the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Vice Chair, it says, shall
deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding
supervision and regulation of depository institution . . .</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>companies . . . ,</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>and shall oversee the
supervision and regulation of such firms.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for
someone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets
to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Congress wanted
that person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the way it
works—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I give
my, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I have good conversations,
and I try to contribute constructively.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that
person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think
that’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I believe that’s what the law
requires.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an
intelligent discussion about what’s going on and why.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, that’s, that’s my input.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of
Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just wondered if you have any regrets?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or was there anything that, you
know—decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what’s happened?</div>

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve had a few, sure.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, you know, who doesn’t look back and
think that you could have done things differently?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As one of my great mentors used to
always say, “Control the controllable.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn
the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and I think that, that
Vice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Did the possibility of
pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m curious if
you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again
or what those discussions entailed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across
the board.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the
minutes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But people did talk about pausing,
but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re,
we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you
know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various
channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and we’re going to be looking at
those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the
statement.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report
or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just think
we’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think we can
afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ve learned from the banking
crisis—that you would learn the right lessons.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What are those lessons?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which
is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through
history.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in
supervision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought
that was possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite
so quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that, you know, that will play through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I, you know—it will be up to
Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think—I think
that’s one thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I guess I would just say that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then, you know—that we’re going to—
obviously, we’re going to revisit [this].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that
we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m, I’m
thinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you be any more specific on stress testing or
looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s—see, that’s, that’s what Vice Chair Barr’s role really
is, and he’ll take the lead on that.</div>
