Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
November 1, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon, everyone.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Welcome.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain
squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for
the American people.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain
strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that
tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full
effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given how far we have come,
along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will
make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain
restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic
developments.</span> <small>(0.851)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and
well above earlier expectations.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an
outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">After picking up
somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well

below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Higher interest rates also
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.8 percent.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the
supply of workers.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic
levels.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined
so far this year.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the
supply of available workers.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Total PCE prices rose
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.</span> <small>(0.345)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has moderated since the middle of last
year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But a few months of good data are
only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down
sustainably toward our goal.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a
long way to go.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain
well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and
forecastters, as well as measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
Page 2 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our restrictive
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are
confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand
for labor.</span> <small>(0.372)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is
no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further
tightening of monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher
longer-term bond yields, among other factors.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Because persistent changes in financial conditions
can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments
closely.</span> <small>(0.829)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is
proceeding carefully.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation as well as the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In determining the extent of additional policy firming
Page 3 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring
price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices
over the longer run.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Howard.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell,
for doing this.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To what—you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields—to what degree did
that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for your question.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want
to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, if
you—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has been coming
down, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market has been
rebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">GDP growth has been strong, although
many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 4 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
As for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that’s
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we’re not confident yet
that we have achieved such a stance.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that is the broader context into which this, this strong
economy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of
rates.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields
and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the
path of monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.847)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming]
from higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower
equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.</span> <small>(0.737)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that is something
that remains to be seen.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s critical.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not
what we’re looking for.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are
material.</span> <small>(0.804)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t
simply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we
didn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, and I would say on
that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the
increase in longer-term rates.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is
that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households
and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this
tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,
Page 5 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
which could have pretty significant effect on housing.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how I would answer your
question.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this: In your opening
statement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions
are restrictive enough to finish the fight.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that true?</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s exactly right.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, to say it a different way: We
haven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings.</span> <small>(0.569)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have not made a determination,
and we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s—that is—the
way we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the
extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to
2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you so much for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I
wonder, you know, if you don’t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at
that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting
rate increases next year?</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about
September.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re asking a hypothetical there.</span> <small>(0.750)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll
get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on
economic activity, and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation, the broader financial
condition situation and broader world situation.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be looking at all those things as we make
a decision in December.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We haven’t made that decision.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 6 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I would say, though, that, that the idea that if you—the idea that would—difficult to raise
again after stopping for a meeting or two, it’s just not right.</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, the Committee will always
do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about—
at all about December.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December
today.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, did the Fed
staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today’s meeting?</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening
is persistent?</span> <small>(0.730)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the
spring.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What is it here on something that’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar
to simulate?</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the
recession.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the answer is “no.”</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the
minutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity
we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be
doing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can see
how volatile it is.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an
estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very
quickly.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you
can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 7 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And over time, that will have an effect.</span> <small>(0.684)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just don’t know how persistent it’s going to be, and
it’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I’d be comfortable communicating into how many
rate hikes that is.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident—what
makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above-trend growth when
500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and
sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you
raise interest rates, you do see those effects.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you see those effects in the economy now.</span> <small>(0.750)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You see what’s happening in the housing market.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re seeing that now.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ll see, if you
look at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds
because rates are so high now.</span> <small>(0.614)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the
effects of this—of this could be quite significant.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This has been a resilient

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there are a number of possible
reasons why that may be.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,
and so we take the economy as it comes.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of the
thresholds that you’ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence
of persistently above-trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market
tightness—that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike
would be necessary.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m just curious if that’s how the Committee sees it.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ve identified those factors.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those were not meant to be the
only factors or a specific test that we’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Really, we’re going to be looking at the broader picture.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, what’s happening with our
progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal?</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Is the labor market continuing to, broadly, cool off
and achieve a better balance?</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be looking at that.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, growth—we look at growth
insofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals.</span> <small>(0.386)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We look at that, and we look at broader
financial conditions.</span> <small>(0.740)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you
know, whether we need to further tighten policy.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, if we do reach that judgment, then we
will further tighten policy.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if
that is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates,
what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts?</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could we see those maybe pulled
forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts
right now at all.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not talking about rate cuts.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re still very focused on the first question,
which is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is the question we’re focusing on.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive?</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Will policy remain
restrictive?</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident
that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’ll be the next question, but
honestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question of rate cuts
just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you
know, as close to right as you can.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>

there was a tightening bias in the Committee.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You say in the statement you’re looking to assess
the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.</span> <small>(0.789)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>

don’t—we haven’t made a determination.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there
is no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for
two hikes?</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>

CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say that at all.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say—I mean, the language,

to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the question we’re asking.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the Committee
here?</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question
we’re asking is, should we hike more?</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and
you’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, there are significant issues out there, as you point out.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Global
geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that goes for the war in Ukraine; it goes for the
war between Israel and Hamas.</span> <small>(0.773)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re monitoring that.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our job is to monitor those things for
their economic implications.</span> <small>(0.754)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to
an end.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Oil prices have flattened out; they haven’t gone down.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess they’ve gone down a
little bit from their earlier peak.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we
don’t know about that one.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s plenty of risk out there.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would go back to—the
bigger picture from our standpoint is, we’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market,
making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re very focused on

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just one quick thing: You, last month, had gone to

of small business owners.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you
pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of
what they talked about?</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised.</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I was very impressed by
York as a town with a real strategy.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’ve done a great job as a city, I think.</span> <small>(0.612)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s

painful for people—particularly people who don’t have a lot of extra financial resources who are
spending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life.</span> <small>(0.711)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we know that.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That wasn’t new.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in
York, and, you know, I walked away from that even—you know, I mean, just thinking that we
really—the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability—fully restore price
stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage
we can.</span> <small>(0.569)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for
the economy in order to get inflation down.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But since the economy has not responded to rate
hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all—on
how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall
growth?</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been
able to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the same is true of growth.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And growth has been
strong, but yet we’re still seeing this.</span> <small>(0.370)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I
think still believe, that is likely to be true.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely
that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor
market conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but it’s only a good
Page 12 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
thing that we haven’t seen it, and I think we know why.</span> <small>(0.656)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, since, since we lifted off,
we, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One of them—one of
which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the
pandemic and the response to the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary
policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space
to recover.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But it’s
that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower
growth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and
bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in
the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of
why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, we welcome that.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think,
and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Against that backdrop, if you’ve gotten any clarity on lags—if you
have an economy that’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that
there isn’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that&#39;s still coming through the pipeline and
that it may have already come into effect?</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s been one
year at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s a
full year since then.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this
year—we’re seeing it.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you can, for
Page 13 of 27

example—an example where you wouldn’t have felt this yet is, is debt that had been termed out.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and there
are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I
don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags
are.</span> <small>(0.786)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is
really not a good way to do it.”</span> <small>(0.682)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process
down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.</span> <small>(0.810)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it takes time.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that, and you can’t rush it.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better
sense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m
trying to connect the dots here.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel’s question
is, you said you need slower growth.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You had always said before a period of lower-than-trend
growth.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Has that changed?</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, two, it sounds to me like you’re basically saying here that kind
of the dot plot’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase
for right now—doesn’t matter about the turn of the year—and that there’s not an objective way
to determine whether or not you’ve got enough tightening in the system.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just going to be a
subjective judgment, meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the dot plot is a picture
in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in
light of their own personal economic forecast.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s
not, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a forecast that would
change, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I
Page 14 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wouldn’t write down that dot six weeks later.”</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Think of the number of things that could change
your mind on that.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three-month
period between that meeting and the next meeting.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, nonetheless, it’s out there.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t—
we do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, I
think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be—
my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was
“below potential.”</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily—
potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So the right way to
think about it is, what’s potential growth this year?</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People think trend growth over a long period
of time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what we’ve
had is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned,
through both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning
in the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and
shortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">There’s
catch-up growth that can happen in potential.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that means that if you’re growing—you could
be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output
of the economy.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I hope that’s clear.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s really what’s going on.</span> <small>(0.366)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s why I would say it as
below potential.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by
meeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting
Page 15 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at
each meeting?</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s
characterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, we’re going meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive
to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re looking
at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we
look at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking
cycle, very far.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a
relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re close to the—to
the end of the cycle.</span> <small>(0.650)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not a
promise or a plan of the future.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’re going into these meetings one by one.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re
looking at the data.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful.</span> <small>(0.399)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re proceeding
carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.</span> <small>(0.415)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Monetary policy is restrictive.</span> <small>(0.795)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see
its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how I think
about it.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin with Axios.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of the run-up
in long-term yields we’ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the
pace of your asset runoff program?</span> <small>(0.754)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if there were judgment that higher—that the higher-
term premium was endangering the dual-mandate goals, would that be reason to think about
slowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around
reserves?</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 16 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance
sheet runoff.</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not something we’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many
candidate explanations for why rates have been going up.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And QT is certainly on that list.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it’s
not—I think—I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s not something that we’re—that we’re looking at right now.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask about the Basel
III Endgame capital proposal.</span> <small>(0.771)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve gotten a lot of “pushback” from people on different
aspects of the proposal, and you yourself expressed some reservations.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m just curious:
Could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, that proposal is out for comment.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we expect a lot of
comment.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year.</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
we’ve extended the deadline.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll take them seriously.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll read them.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll say what,
what I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.</span> <small>(0.666)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It means broad support.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, in addition to persistence,
when you look at long-term Treasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those
tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further
tightening?</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what do we look at?</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We look at a very wide range of financial
conditions and, in fact, as you’ll know, different organizations publish different financial
conditions’ indexes, which can have, you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables,
so there’s a very rich environment.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we tend to look at a few of them.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not going to give
you the names, but, you know, they’re a few of the common ones that people look at.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so
they’re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates,
the credit spreads.</span> <small>(0.848)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sometimes they’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn’t
any one thing.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We would never look at, for example, long-term Treasury rates in isolation, nor
would we ignore them.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play
a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes.</span> <small>(0.807)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Your second
question was?</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the banking stress.</span> <small>(0.754)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you know,
we, we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in
the March—the things we went through in March and thereafter.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’ve been working a
lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that
they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have.</span> <small>(0.759)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we do think the banking system is quite resilient.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had, you know, a handful of bank
failures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t have any reason to think
that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong
banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,
on funding, and those sorts of things.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Last week you
and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for
comment.</span> <small>(0.662)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there—what it would mean for
merchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of
both debit and credit cards in the—in the payment system?</span> <small>(0.732)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, so you’re right.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We put a proposal out for comment, is
what we did.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in
Dodd-Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s all we’re
trying to do.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What else can we really do?</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t
comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we do hope that
stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They
haven’t been shy about that.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that
now.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence with Fox
Business.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So for the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core
well over 3 percent.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but
with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus
overall inflation?</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and
be bumpy, but we’re making progress.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came
down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the best thing I could point you to would
be the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of
Page 19 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
next year, on a 12-month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further
into the 2s.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So that’s, that’s—if you look historically, that’s, that’s sort of consistent with the
way inflation comes down.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get
further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the good news is, you
know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive.</span> <small>(0.789)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we feel like we’re on a
path to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do.</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you’ve said in the past that doing too little on interest
rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How robust
was the debate about this pause on the doing-too-little side?</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we know
that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get
entrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation will be both
more—both higher and more volatile.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so
we’re really committed to not letting that happen.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, for the first year or so of our
tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, you know, we’re—
we’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can’t
identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will.</span> <small>(0.606)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Quick follow-up
to the question about banking stresses—you talked about how the banking system is resilient.</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of
course, part of the resilience the past year stems from the Bank Term Funding Program that you
launched in March.</span> <small>(0.825)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are

first quarter of next year.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Quick second question about inflation
expectations—the U. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one-year-ahead inflation
expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Last year you said that particular survey was a really
decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions.</span> <small>(0.763)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If it stays elevated next time around, how big
of an input will that be into your December thinking?</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We look at a range of, of things.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think the, the, the, you
know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was actually a preliminary
estimate that got revised away.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we look at many, many things.</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also
market-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between
meetings.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it will—
they’re right.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor.</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can always find one
reading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the
public believes that inflation will come down.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical
in winning the battle.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Megan Cassella with Barron’s.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for
taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned
today that you’re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, and you’ve recently said
that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now.</span> <small>(0.392)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I was curious if you could
elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view, has risen.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So first thing to say is that it’s very important.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a very
important variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with
any precision in real time.</span> <small>(0.771)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we know that.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you have to just take that—you have to take
your estimate of it with a grain of salt.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What we know now is, you know, within a range of
estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on
economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we do—we do talk about this.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s not any
debate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or
not.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Ultimately, it’s
unknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and
giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our
moves.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down
to 2 percent over time?</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the question we’re asking ourselves.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, you know, years
from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have to look—we have to have
those models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the
effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>

MEGAN CASSELLA.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up on a wages point.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Earlier you talked about
the inflation outlook, but I’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its
current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have—
wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a
level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent
inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time.</span> <small>(0.393)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s much
closer than it was.</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this
week.</span> <small>(0.564)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too.</span> <small>(0.733)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and all of them
are kind of saying that, which is great.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you have to look at a group of them because any one
of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what you see.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so what
you saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if
you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down
substantially in June.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the
June reading.</span> <small>(0.730)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our
expectations internally, too.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we feel good about that.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Also I would say it isn’t—in my
thinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far,
although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy
becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of
the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Chair
Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you
are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the
concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It was not getting rates high enough in time
to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that was the concern.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still
trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is.</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you can see that.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think, and
I think, that the risks are getting more balanced.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more—
closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That range, if
you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re
going to see that.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates
of a neutral policy rate.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now that’s arithmetic.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the
economy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to
being in balance.</span> <small>(0.697)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you said the proof is how the economy
reacts.</span> <small>(0.806)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What are you looking at to be sure you’re not overshooting?</span> <small>(0.690)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still
broadly cooling?</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where
inflation was clearly cooling and coming down.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and
they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The data have bounced back.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what are we

seeing?</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Are we seeing—is inflation still coming down?</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s the first thing.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The second
thing is, in the labor market, what we’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and
demand, partly through just much more supply coming online.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And with labor demand still
clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last
quarter, it’s still very strong demand.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So—and you see wage increases coming down as we
discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that’s—we want to see that, that
whole set of processes continue.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Bryan.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">BRYAN MENA.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Bryan Mena, CNN.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you think that there has been any structural
change in either consumption or in the job market that’s pushing at consumption?</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You
obviously saw the third-quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect
everyone’s spending to have fizzled out by now.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m kind of wondering if there’s been any
structural change in consumption.</span> <small>(0.351)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption.</span> <small>(0.389)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
would say it’s certainly been strong.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so a couple of things.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We may have underestimated
the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it.</span> <small>(0.734)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There
may be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount
of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really
at all, or in-person services.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think,
although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of
savings.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We may not be there yet.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So things are—clearly, people are still spending.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than
inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises
Page 25 of 27

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
spending, which continues to drive more hiring.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so you’ve had a really—that whole—that
whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off, so that
goods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, from a
business standpoint, there are more people to hire.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And it is more labor supply.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the whole
thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s been—you know,
it’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, it’s been a dynamic.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question is, how long can that continue?</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, I just
think this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the
pandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still
learning.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning
about how it plays out.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s all we can do.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">DANIEL AVIS.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.</span> <small>(0.765)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel–Hamas conflict.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel–Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine
“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained
disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.”</span> <small>(0.759)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve had
organizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war spreads to
other countries in the region.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments
in the Middle East—you mentioned they are—and just what the potential economic impact could
be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t want to speculate too much, but I’ll just say so—you
know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things

November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we’re talking about.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The price of
oil has really not reacted very much so far to this.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As the—you know, as the Fed—as the Federal
Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and
economic effects.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it isn’t clear, at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going
to—is on track to have significant economic effects.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly
important and something for people to, you know, to take really important notice of, but it may
or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an
economic body.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “calls out” risks.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s what it’s doing—[it] is calling out a risk of that.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the war in Ukraine, the same.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The war in Ukraine did have, immediately, very
significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, thank you.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks very much.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
