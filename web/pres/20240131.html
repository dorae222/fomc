Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
January 31, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased
from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s very good news.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path
forward is uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past two years, we’ve significantly tightened the stance
of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory,
and we’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As labor market tightness
has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and
inflation goals are moving into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will have more to say about monetary policy—
about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>For 2023 as a whole, GDP
expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high
mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed
investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 1 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a
pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate remains low
at 3.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of
workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year,
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic
levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The lower inflation
readings over the second half of last year are welcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But we will need to see continuing
evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-
term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of
surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and
we’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our restrictive stance of
Page 2 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the
economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy
restraint at some point this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since
the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The
economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re prepared
to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that
reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve
seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At
the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic
activity and employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the
balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target
range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-run—longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 3 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’t
want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming—coming down
fully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wonder—what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And as you
make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data
against the sort of solid inflation progress you’ve been seeing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry—say that last part again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>How are—how are you weighing the growth data and
consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let
me say that we have confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is
moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been
increasing, but we want to get greater confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What do we want to see?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to see
more good data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not that we’re looking for better data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—we’re looking at continuation
of the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we have six months
of good inflation data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it
sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent
inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the answer will come from some more data that’s also good
Page 4 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It doesn’t—it’s not that the six-month data isn’t—isn’t low enough.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s just a
question of, can we take that with confidence that we’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s really what we’re thinking about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve
had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth
quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in
economic activity—that hasn’t been the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger
growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t look at it as a problem.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to see a strong labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not looking for a weaker labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re
looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six
months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could just follow up very quickly, the—when,
when you say that you want to make sure that it’s a true signal, is there anything that you’re
seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it’s a true signal at this stage?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>No, I think it’s—I, I would say it, it seems—it seems to be the likely
case that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven’t yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so—I mean, it’s a good story.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have six months of good inflation [readings].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you
can—and you know this—you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it’s
been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly
negative.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably
approximate zero.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, in
other words, what we care about is the aggregate number—not so much the composition.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
Page 5 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we, we just need to see more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s where we are, as a Committee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We need to see more
evidence that sort of confirms what we think we’re seeing and that tells us that we are on—gives
us confidence that we’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, it seems to
me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One was the risk of a wage–
price spiral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This
morning’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private-sector payroll growth running at a
sub–4 percent pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation
emergency of the last three years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, given that you appear to have substantially cut off these
two tail risks and that you’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory,
what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you really going to learn
more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does
believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for—partly for the reasons that you say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Growth has been strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor
market is strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really
confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of
dialing back the restrictive level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, overall, I think—I think people do believe—and, as you
know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But I think to get to that place
where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in
fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could ask differently: If, if you hold rates high as inflation
moderates, as it—as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its
variants.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by
those rules in the current instance?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor
rules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We consult them regularly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re in our, our
Tealbook, and, and they’re in all the materials that we look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, I don’t think
we’ve ever been at a—at a place where we were—where we were setting policy by them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
there—depending on the rule, it will tell you different things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are many different
formulations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates
go up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that doesn’t mean we can
mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It doesn’t mean that
at all, because, for one thing, we, we don’t know—we, we look at more than just the fed funds
rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We look at—broadly—financial conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, in addition, we don’t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is
at any given time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that also doesn’t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the
economy turn down, because that would be too late.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re really in a risk-management
mode: of managing the risk—as I mentioned in my opening remarks—managing the risk that we
move too soon and move too late.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I think to move, which is—which is where almost
everyone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of
that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 7 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I’d like you to, to key in on the
use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “remains elevated.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’ve pledged to cut
rates before inflation reached 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that implies that there’s some sort of intermediate
step here on, on inflation and that a, a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement
language that inflation “remains elevated.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s the step-down from there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, I, I don’t know that we’ve worked out the particulars—
statement language and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at
where, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent,
for example—12-month—which is way down from where it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Very, very positive
development—very fast decline—and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue
to come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so that’s where—that’s where it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re, you know, we’re wanting to
see, you know, more data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows
that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’t mention the
other side of the mandate—a slide in employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Would a slide in employment also bring you
to the point of, of cutting rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say that we’re not looking for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not
something we’re looking for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, yes, if you think about, you know—in, in the base case, the
economy is performing well—the labor market remains strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If we saw an unexpected
weakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Absolutely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things—would
argue for moving later.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we
have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth—we have a strong labor market—we
Page 8 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have inflation coming down—that’s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And in that case, what we’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage
of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CLAIRE JONES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just to circle back to the “greater
confidence” aspect of the statement, there’s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m just
wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is there unanimity
or, at least, consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater
confidence is?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you
know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence
to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “greater confidence”
threshold could be reached?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re not—we’re not really at that stage.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re—
we’re—there was no proposal to cut rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some people did, you know, talk about their view of
the rate path.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence
of where people are, although it is—it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, you know,
we’re not—we’re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we
weren’t actively considering, you know, a—moving, moving the federal funds rate down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will
say, there is a—there is a wide disparity—a healthy disparity—of views, and you see that in
public, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they’re released every five
years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that’s actually essential for making
good policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other—
Page 9 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we, we compromise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’re able to—for the
most part—able to join in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To me, that’s a well-functioning public institution.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, over the past few years, there have been all these real-time
indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like
OpenTable data or office attendance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve talked about vacancies in the past.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m
wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that’s giving you the
clearest picture of the economy—including on rents—if you could touch on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Including?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rent costs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, so we’re not—you know, it’s not the pandemic, so we
can actually rely on more, more traditional forms.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People are working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re getting wages,
and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I
wouldn’t say we’re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you
point to rents.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Which
would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So
the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as
measured, measured in PCE inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just a question of when and,
and how big it’ll be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that will—that
will help.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of
disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some
Page 10 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
more time to run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, these—the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they
were.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, it takes time for the, the healing process to get into prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there may be
still a tailwind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll find out with, with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at the things that relate to our
mandate very carefully, and—as you would imagine.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess, just as a quick follow-up—do you feel comfortable at this
point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more
confidence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I think
we have—we have a ways to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above
target on a 12-month basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Twelve months is our, our target, certainly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m encouraged, and
we’re encouraged by the progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring
victory at all at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think we have a ways to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve said that you would know the
neutral rate by its works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I’m wondering what you could tell me—how do you believe the
neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In other words, how
much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And how much
restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s—I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the
economy—you do see, for example, housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You see the effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Your, your second
question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through—a lot of
the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor
market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other
Page 11 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
cycles and has brought that working with tighter, tighter policy, which has enabled the supply
side to recover—I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, no—we
really do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would point to the
interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s a—it’s a joint
story.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a complicated story.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the
economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—so I think it’s, it’s—of course, you know that it’s not something
you can identify with any precision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But if you—a standard approach would be to take the
nominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If
you do that—and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like
to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream
estimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And—but at the same time, you look at
the economy, and you say, “This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and you
say, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What’s happening, though, is, the supply
side has been recovering in the middle of this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that won’t go on forever.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So a lot of the
growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and
demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and
supply chains healing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you
know, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RICH MILLER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you—sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You mentioned earlier we’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you
Page 12 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
talk a little bit more about that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote,
unquote, “normal” and that the—we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming
back down to what they were pre-pandemic?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Even with today’s ECI levels, they were still above
those pre-pandemic levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing
normal—but not totally back to normal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you pointed to one or more of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think,
you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Wages—wage increases, rather,
are not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I would
look at it this way, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that process will probably take some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So wage setting is something that happens—it’s,
it’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s okay.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s okay.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that
wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving
back to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are
more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one—
and, and, you know, I think we’re, we’re moving in the right direction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market,
basically, you’re saying?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s
rebalancing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Clearly, that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers
and supply at the beginning of the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we lost several million workers at the
beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then when the
economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just—it
Page 13 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was everywhere—panic on the part of businesses—couldn’t, couldn’t find people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, what’s
happened is—we expected labor—the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it
didn’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well,
maybe we won’t get it back.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then 2023, we did, as you know—so labor force participation
came back strongly in ’23, and so did immigration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Immigration came to a halt during the
pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor
market to what is still a very strong labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s still a good labor market for wages and for
finding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know,
one great way to look at that is what’s happening with, with wage increases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you see it now
across the, the major things that we—that we track.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a
clear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with
where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
wanted to follow up on Rich’s question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It sounded like you suggested that you’re not worried
about faster growth so much—so wanted to see if you’re seeing anything that suggests that
inflation could reaccelerate from here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And it sounds like you’re saying you’re not worried that
solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would
reaccelerate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think the, the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level
meaningfully above 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s, to me, more likely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, if—if inflation were
to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that, and that would—
Page 14 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that would be a surprise at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I have to tell you, that’s why we keep our options open
here and why we’re not, you know, rushing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think both of those are risks, but I think the
more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you’ve had six good months—very good
months—but what, what’s really going to “shake out” here?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, where—what will—
when we look back, what will we see?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat
themselves?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t think so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t—you know, that’s not what we think, but that’s the
question we are asking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just one quick follow-up—Governor Waller had
mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that something
you’re watching as well?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if, if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you
more confidence where things are going?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll just have to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll—we look at those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Last year
was a—was a, a surprise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you don’t
want to use the term “soft landing,” would you say, at least, that, from your point of view now,
the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risks have
diminished very much?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And you mentioned below–2 percent inflation for—on a three-month
basis, core PCE has been running at 1½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there are those on Wall Street who think
that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation
running below your target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do you see that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 15 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, how to—your first question—how to describe where we are?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So
I guess I would just say this—executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over
the course of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market—3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor
market is strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve had just about two years now of, of unemployment under 4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That hasn’t happened in 50 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s a good labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we’ve seen inflation come
down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve talked about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an
expectation that there’s more to come.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is a—this is a good situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s be honest.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is a—this is a good economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what’s the outlook?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s looking in the rearview—the outlook—we do expect
growth to moderate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’t happened, but
we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its
course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market is rebalancing, as, as I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job creation has slowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The base
of job growth has narrowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, 12-month inflation is, is above target and getting,
you know, getting down closer to target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on
track for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So those are the risks and, and questions we have to answer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, overall, this is a
pretty good picture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It, it is a good picture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Your second question was—sorry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Could you get inflation that is below target—end up with inflation
below target, and you have to do something about that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the
2 percent base once.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And the same
thing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s
annualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re not—you know, we’re not
looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
So if we do face those circumstances, then we’ll have to deal with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think—I think as of
now, you know, the, the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish
the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you,
Mr. Chairman, for taking this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, as I’ve—as I’ve heard from some District Fed presidents, is
it, in your view, a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then
when we do see that first rate cut, is that—should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate-cut
cycle, or is it a one-off?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll point you to that language on your first question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We, we
included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor
market, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when
to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if you take that to the current
context—current context, we’re going to be data dependent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to be looking at this
meeting by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely
that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify
March as the time to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s, that’s to be seen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I wouldn’t call—you know, when
you say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say I
don’t think that’s—that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base
case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And your second question is—
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On, on the—is this the start of a—when we see a cut, is it the
start of a cutting cycle, or is it—could it just be a one-off?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 17 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, that’s going to depend on the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The whole thing is,
this is going to depend on the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects
the outlook and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re going to make our decisions based on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
it could wind up—you know, we’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting, and, and
people will write down what they think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, in the end, it’s really going to depend on how the
economy evolves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower—for
example, stronger inflation—more, more persistent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are risks that would cause us
to—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or—and sooner.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And that would be a
weakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those
are the kinds of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re just—we’re just going to be reacting to the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s the—
that’s really the only way we can do this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Could you talk a little bit more
about productivity growth?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you’ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the
level of wage growth that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve obviously seen, you
know—you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it’s cooled a little bit but still sort of
above what you wanted to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth has been very strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How much of those numbers do
you attribute to productivity?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because
of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about—or do you think that
productivity growth will, will fade over time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is a really interesting question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think—my, my own
view is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as
workers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then you saw a deep trough
Page 18 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of productivity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then, over the last—you saw high productivity last year, in ’23.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think
we’re, we’re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the question
will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on,
you know, fundamental aspects of our economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there—is there a case—will it be the case
that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What would it take?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is
that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work
from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or AI, artificial intelligence—
generative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say
that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and
out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So would that be behind why we’ve seen such strong
growth, but we’ve also seen inflation fall—that maybe there’s just a higher level of productivity?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s one way to look at it.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I want to ask a little bit more about housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I’m wondering—how closely are you
watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And it seems
like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So when we think about, you know—our, our statutory goals are
maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re targeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not targeting
housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those are very important
Page 19 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
things for people’s lives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But they’re not—you know, those are not the things we’re targeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the
housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And when we raise rates,
the housing industry can be hurt, because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
we have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And these are not—these are not things that
we have any tools to address.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our
work is inflation, which is a combination.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s, it’s really rental inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re taking owners’
equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you’re, you’re running that through the
CPI calculation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And what that’s telling
you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will
show up in inflation over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has to as long as that remains the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And just real quick—what is your response to the
letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to
make housing more affordable?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job—the
job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is
absolutely essential for people’s lives, most importantly for—well, not most importantly—most,
mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the
margins.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so someone—for someone like that, high inflation in the—in the necessities of
life—right away, you’re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know,
some scope to absorb higher costs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we have to get—it’s our job.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s what society has asked
Page 20 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
us to do, is to get inflation down, and the tools that we use to do it are interest rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s
how we think about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Courtenay.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COURTENAY BROWN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you give us some insight
into whether the Committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the
months ahead?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has
gone very well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as the process has continued, you know, we’re getting to that time where
questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So at
this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we’re planning to begin in-
depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So those, those
questions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re, we’re at the
beginning of that process, I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Quick follow-up—is it the case that the Fed would decide to
lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so they
don’t—for example, if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but
continuing to run off the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In both cases, that’s normalization, but from a strict
monetary policy standpoint, you could say we’re loosening along with tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So that, that
could happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about, but right now, we’re
thinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ll—we’ll be looking into that as a Committee
starting in March.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair
Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build
up confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’t
start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Roughly how many months do you think you might need of, of good inflation data to be—to be
confident?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m just going to
say—and it’s not that we don’t have any confidence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we have growing confidence, but not
to the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the
process of, of dialing back on restriction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we want to get that right, and we feel like the
strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We think that’s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we’ve made a lot
of progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable
way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s how we’re thinking about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of when that’ll be, you know, that, that’ll all

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not a decision that we’ve made, but I, I wouldn’t think we’d, we’d
be—we wouldn’t be taking a position that it’s got to go to zero.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, if it—if it were to
stabilize at a different level—but that’s, that’s not a decision that we’ve made.</div>

what we’ll be talking about at the March meeting.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, I want to change
gears a little bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the presidential primary campaign that’s been going on for the last nine
months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates had said that they
probably wouldn’t want to give you a third term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you want another term—you’ve had—on the Fed?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What, what’s your stance on that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t have a stance on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not something I’m focused on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>[We’re] focused on doing our jobs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have—this year is going to be a highly consequential
year for, for the Fed and for monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re, all of us, very buckled down, focused
on doing our jobs.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with

<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over
the past six months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year, at 2.4
percent, compared to that six-month measure.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given that forecast and that the median is for
three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it’s been over the last six months
for the next six months?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 23 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I—you know, we’re going to do—we’ll update our, our inflation
forecasts at the next meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You referred to the December meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s, you know,
three months old [by March], so it might be lower now, given the data we’ve gotten.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, look, as
I mentioned, we’re going to be reacting to the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If, if we get—if we get very strong inflation
data and it, it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we’ll go slower or later or both.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If we got really
good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the—that, that would tell us that, that we
could go sooner and perhaps go faster.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re just going to be—but, of course, we’ll weigh
that with all the other factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re setting policy based on the totality of, of the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But just to follow—if inflation stays where it is currently,
that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would that mean
you’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, I think if we—if we came to the view that, that inflation
were—that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in “PCE
world”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be, then,
yes, our policy would be in a different place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, you know, that’s the whole point is,
we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a
sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>DANIEL AVIS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Daniel Avis, Agence France-Presse.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I just wondered
if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It seems to suggest that
consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just
wonder—is it fair to say that they’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in
Page 24 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
recent months?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has
played a role in that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what challenges do you see, going forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys
have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a
couple of years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ve asked ourselves why
that is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on
this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So prices went up much more
than 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And people are going to the store, and
they’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they’re not happy about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And it’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price—the
prices they’re paying are still high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that is what—that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
they’re, they’re right to be unhappy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, this is why we need to keep price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s
why we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of [surveys]—you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of—you’ve
seen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess that’s a good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That can—that can support spending—can support
economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s some evidence of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you
know, a meaningful increase.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve
been at various times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s—they certainly have come up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Bryan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>BRYAN MENA.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Bryan Mena, CNN Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Committee members have said they’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large
revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the
economy being quarterly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So did any members say they’ve learned anything not reflected in the
data?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’t been
captured in the data yet?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, yes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we do meet
with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I always feel like
you—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual
companies—individual management teams—and then building out from that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, starting
with GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s very hard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I really like anecdotal data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks
have really the best network of anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In all their Districts, they’re talking to, you know, not
just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit
community.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They have arms into all of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so when they come back—that’s what goes
into the Beige Book.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during
the outlook go-around, they’ll say, “In my District . . .”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And they’ll talk about 100 conversations
they—not—they won’t talk—they, they will give you input, based on 100 conversations that
they’ve had with people of all different walks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s—I personally find it very helpful in
understanding what’s going on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the
data sometimes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Did any of them—did any of them notice slowing economy based on
what they’ve heard from, like, their District?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 26 of 27

January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, if you—if you look back at the last—not this Beige
Book, but the one before, it was more—there was a lot of “slower activity.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that, that
what you’re hearing now is, is, things are picking up a bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re hearing—not, not in every
District and not every, every person that we talk to, but you’re—overall, it feels like you’re
hearing things picking up at the margin.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what comes through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEFF COX.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, sir.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just kind of looking to put it all
together: You talked about basically the, the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent
annualized growth in the fourth quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to
you now than any inflation threat might?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That, you know—you’re in a position, in other words,
to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’re more—you’re more tilted
towards that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too
strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not so worried about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, it’s—again, we’ve had
inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in
unemployment, and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if
it’s going to continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I, I am—you know, I think—I think declining inflation—continued
declines in inflation are, are really the main thing we’re looking at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, we want the labor
market to remain strong, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We don’t have a growth mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We’ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a,
a price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth only matters to the
extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much.</div>
