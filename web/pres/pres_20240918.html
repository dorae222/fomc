Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of
August.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy
restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">This decision reflects our
growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the
labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving
sustainably down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.852)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid
pace.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data
point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Growth of consumer spending has
remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic
pace last year.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising
strongly in the first.</span> <small>(0.757)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the
strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our Summary of Economic
Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median
projection of 2 percent over the next few years.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 1 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Payroll job gains averaged
116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in
the year.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage
growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Overall, a broad
set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before
the pandemic in 2019.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year,
four-tenths higher than projected in June.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE
prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food
and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Longer-term inflation expectations
appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households,
businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median projection
in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat
lower than projected in June.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For much of the past three years,
inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely
tight.</span> <small>(0.362)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are
acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 2 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply
and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well
anchored.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much
closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation
have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We now see the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the
risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today’s meeting, the
Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to
4¾ percent to 5 percent.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of
the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we
begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are not on any preset course.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At
the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and
employment.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,
the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
Page 3 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this
year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These median projections are lower than in June,
consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the
changed balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy remains solid and inflation
persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If the labor market were to weaken
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to
respond.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in
pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</span> <small>(0.783)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-
employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our
questions.</span> <small>(0.773)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In July, you said you weren’t necessarily thinking about a 50.</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You didn’t want to be
specific, but you said you weren’t thinking about a 50.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The inflation data last week came out a
little firmer than expected.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent.</span> <small>(0.557)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what
Page 4 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it
shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market?</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I guess, should we expect more
50s in the months ahead?</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And based on what should we make that call?</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [</span> <small>(0.744)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Laughter] Let me jump in.</span> <small>(0.650)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So,
since the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve had the
two employment reports, July and August.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one
that came in during blackout.</span> <small>(0.606)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not
maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high
and will be revised down.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know that.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data
collected in] the Beige Book.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we took all of those, and we went into blackout.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we
thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the
people that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s one question.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What
was the second and third?</span> <small>(0.662)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do we make the—sorry, thank you, sir.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do we figure out
in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that
call?</span> <small>(0.614)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So a couple things.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A good place to start is the—is the SEP,
but let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by
meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If you look at
the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from
where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s
more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that process will take
place over time.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to
Page 5 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
get this done.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This, this process evolves over time.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, that’s a projection.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a
baseline projection.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do
will depend on the way the economy evolves.</span> <small>(0.740)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can go quicker if that’s appropriate.</span> <small>(0.362)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We can
go slower if that’s appropriate.</span> <small>(0.342)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can pause if that’s appropriate.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s, that’s what we are
contemplating.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the
Committee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are
thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Chris.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRIS RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
projections show that the Fed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their
estimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So does that suggest that you see rates as
restrictive for that entire period?</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you
said you’d like to avoid?</span> <small>(0.399)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little
bit higher?</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I
think people write down their estimate, individuals do.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think every single person on the
Committee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s
a wide range where that could fall.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we don’t know.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are model-based
approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any
given time.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, realistically, we know it by its works.</span> <small>(0.662)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that leaves us in a place where we’ll
be—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be
looking at the way the economy reacts to that.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the
question that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one?</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 6 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We know—if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a
time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Today, unemployment
is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we know that it is time to
recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and
on employment moving to a more sustainable level.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the balance of risks are now even.</span> <small>(0.628)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of
neutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What you have
is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How close was this in terms
of the decision?</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Was the weight
clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we had a good—a good discussion.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, if you go
back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut
and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so there was a lot of
discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think there was also

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would add, though, look at the
SEP.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All 19.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a big change
from June, right?</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Seven of the—seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the
19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts.</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you
know, there is a dissent, and there’s a range of views, but there’s actually a lot of common
ground as well.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We made a good, strong start to this,

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for
taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the
unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Obviously, historically, when the
unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’t typically
just stop—it continues increasing.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the
labor market stabilizing, sort of what’s the mechanism there?</span> <small>(0.402)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what do you see as the risks?</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our
intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can say that about the whole
economy.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The U.S. economy is in good shape.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming
down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s what we’re

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Chair Powell, does today’s
action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data,
or is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate
such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Okay, multiple questions in there.</span> <small>(0.740)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say we don’t think
we’re behind.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of
our commitment not to get behind.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s, it’s a strong move.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry, your other question was?</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between
this meeting and the last meeting?</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or is this about the level of the funds rate—the high nominal
level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you’re trying to maintain equilibrium?</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that
was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation
and very low unemployment.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve waited.</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.</span> <small>(0.829)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our
confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that is what enables
us to take this, this strong move today.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I do not think that anyone should look at this and say,
“Oh, this is the new pace.”</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of
course, what happens will happen.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP,
you see cuts moving along.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a
more neutral level.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given

developments in the economy and the base case.</span> <small>(0.802)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The economy can develop in a way that would
cause us to go faster or slower, but that’s what the base case is.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you
did the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With a larger cut today, is
there any—should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “end
state” on the balance sheet policy?</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They
haven’t come down.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As
you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility].</span> <small>(0.771)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this
at all.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that these two things can happen side by side.</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In a sense, they’re both a form of
normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting
rates.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just following up
on Jeanna’s question on rising unemployment.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Is it your view that this is just a function of a
normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something
more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have
softened too?</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not—why should we not expect
a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive?</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have
cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level—
the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.</span> <small>(0.389)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 10 of 26

So you’re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that.</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what’s driving it?</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Clearly, clearly
payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many—
By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a
very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the labor market bears
close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that.</span> <small>(0.606)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But ultimately, we think—we believe,
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing,
and that will support the labor market.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic
activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an
economy that is still growing at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that should also support the labor market over
time.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but again, we’re—it bears watching.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re watching.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to
happen, wouldn’t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin
to recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising
layoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something
that’s getting ready to happen.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there
is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when
we begin to see the layoffs.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s some lore on that.</span> <small>(0.612)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s the situation we’re in.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have,
in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that
we consider.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio.</span> <small>(0.739)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To follow up on
that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a
higher unemployment rate.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style—
rather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So if—as I
mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the
ability to react to that by, by cutting faster.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate,
though.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to
2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ll be to the labor market,
since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant
amount of monetary easing to just maintain it.</span> <small>(0.372)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see
further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we have a
dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we
been trying to achieve?</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability
without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>

for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re describing this view that you don’t think you’re behind when it
comes to the job market.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be
most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve mentioned a couple, but would you be
able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job
market now?</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most
important one probably.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re at 4.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we
were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back
over the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s one thing.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Participation
is at high levels.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for
aging, participation’s at pretty high levels.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a good thing.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Wages are still a bit above what
would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the
very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to
what that sustainable level is.</span> <small>(0.406)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we feel good about that.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Vacancies over—per unemployed is
back to what is still a very strong level.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not as high as it was.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That number reached two to
one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As measured, it’s now below—it’s around
one.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say.</span> <small>(0.378)</small></p>

back down to normal levels.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The question isn’t the
level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you

downside risks to employment have increased.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and because we have been patient and held
our fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we’re now in a very good
position to manage the risks to both of our goals.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what do you expect to learn between now and November that
will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, more data, the usual.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Don’t look for anything else.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll
see another labor report.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll see another jobs report.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we get a—we might, actually—
we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the
Friday before the meeting.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and inflation data.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll get all this data.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be watching.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications
of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and
think, what’s the right thing to do?</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of
our goals over time?</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin with Axios.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve only been
running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you view that
level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be—would you be content if we
were to kind of stick at that level?</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the
last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather
than job losses.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor
market cooling will have to come through job losses?</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows,
right?</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating
Page 14 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
100,000 jobs, you’re going to see unemployment go up.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it really depends on what’s the trend
underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.</span> <small>(0.751)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We understand there’s been quite an
influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed
the unemployment rate to rise.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is
something we also watch carefully.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think
everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long
way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment,
job loss.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things
with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that
further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s been—
it’s been a great ride down.</span> <small>(0.382)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor
market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½,
maybe under 4 percent.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near-
zero federal funds rate, and some think we’re heading in that direction again.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s the
likelihood that cheap money is now the norm?</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Intuitively, most—many,
many people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were
trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
negative rates.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so—and it
was—people were issuing debt at negative rates.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It seems that’s so far away now.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My own sense
is that we’re not going back to that.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, you
know, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was
back then.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How high is it?</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t—I just don’t think we know.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—again, we only know it by
its works.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will
likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,
and, you know, it’s always the same.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in
particular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we do that, and
we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s—that’s always what it is.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s
never about anything else.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things
that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, nonetheless, this is
what we do.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.</span> <small>(0.819)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, if we
get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this really concentrates the
mind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t put up any other
filters.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we just don’t do that.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jo Ling.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JO LING KENT.</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My first
question is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the
American people, with this unusually large rate cut?</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 16 of 26

CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.714)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place,
and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">More specifically, the economy is
growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and
the labor market is still in solid shape.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we
currently see in the U.S. economy.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll do that by returning rates from their high level,
which has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re,
we’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just have a follow-up to that.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Listening to you talk about inflation
moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive
victory over inflation and rising prices?</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, we’re not.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So inflation, you know—what we say is we want
inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think we’re going
to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re
certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I have
to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Catarina.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CATARINA SARAIVA.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just would love
to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we’ve seen in housing
inflation.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging
a bit, if I can say.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which
Page 17 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’re not rolling over—the leases that are
rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, you know, it’s been
slower than we expected.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those
lower market rents to get into this.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as
market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time
it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As long
as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say it’s—the
rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I
believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services
piece, too.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with
starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.</span> <small>(0.624)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that?</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing
market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People don’t want to sell their homes.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As rates
come down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many
cases.</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean,
the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough
housing.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so it’s going to be challenging.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places
Page 18 of 26

where people want to live.</span> <small>(0.767)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and,
you know, where are we going to get the supply?</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And this is not something that the Fed can, can
really fix.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, I
mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and
getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And then
the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">VICTORIA GUIDA.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria Guida with Politico.</span> <small>(0.690)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Just following up on some of the
labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and
I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too
much comes from the fact that you’re starting to act now and that’s going to give people more
room to run versus just the labor market is strong.</span> <small>(0.387)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then, also, if I could, following up on
Nick’s question, do you see today’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that
you didn’t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall
economy.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.389)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at forecasters or
talk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s no
sense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know,
business people who are actually out there doing business.</span> <small>(0.731)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, you know, I think our
move is timely.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as I said, you can—you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a
commitment to make sure that we don’t fall behind.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re really asking about—your second question, you’re asking about July.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I
guess if you ask if we’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We might
Page 19 of 26

well have.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We didn’t make that decision, but we might well have.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think that’s not—you know,
that doesn’t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let’s look, you know—at
this meeting we’re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report,
the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things
that I mentioned.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re looking at all of those things, and we’re asking ourselves, what’s the
right—what’s the policy stance we need to move to?</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We knew—it’s clear that we—clearly,
literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’s time to move.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>

do you go, and what do you think about the paths forward.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this decision we made today had

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">How
much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Very hard for me to say.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really
speak to mortgage rates.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves.</span> <small>(0.750)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our intention,
though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think that it’s time to
begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come
down as well.</span> <small>(0.712)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the
economy performs.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to
be doing—going to be doing.</span> <small>(0.628)</small></p>

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">What’s your message to households who are frustrated that
home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What do you say to those
households?</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had
a burst of inflation.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and,
when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy
off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s not something that people experience as
pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored.</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And a
good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about
inflation anymore.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just keep it low, keep it stable.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re restoring that.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what we’re going through now really
restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Price stability benefits everybody
over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I completely—we don’t
tell people how to think about the economy, of course.</span> <small>(0.811)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, of course, people are [still]
experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we understand that’s painful.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I was wondering
if you could go through—you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was
like an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would sort of
argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President
John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the
day.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, I mean, could you talk—
Page 21 of 26

September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a
50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out?</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was
a really small probability of a 50 point cut.</span> <small>(0.684)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that play in your consideration at all?</span> <small>(0.641)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just talk
a little bit about that.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for
the economy at that time.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we’ll do.</span> <small>(0.395)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what we did today.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SIMON RABINOVITCH.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</span> <small>(0.739)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve mentioned how closely you’re watching the labor market, but you also noted
that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward
revisions.</span> <small>(0.385)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And given the
SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be
the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,
including the payroll numbers.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not discarding those.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, we’ll certainly look at those,
but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There isn’t a bright line.</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of
course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move
that would dictate one thing or another.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data
on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our
policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I
can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Matt Egan from CNN.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I know that you discussed
earlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, in general,
can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed
decisions on interest rates?</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Because that’s something that former President Trump, who
obviously appointed you, has previously suggested.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I know the Fed is designed to be
independent, but why?</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So countries that are—democracies around the world,
countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central
banks.</span> <small>(0.760)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from
direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe
people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.</span> <small>(0.650)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s the idea, is that—
you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get
lower inflation.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not
serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s just maximum
employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s how the other central
banks are set up, too.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask
you about.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the
changes to the Basel III endgame.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what
those changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you’re looking

for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then
yesterday, other banking regulators—
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.807)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know what, hold the second question.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll give you the second question.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the answer to your question
is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with
my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that
Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, yes, that is—that’s happening
with my support.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is there a date for that—
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re putting
them out for comment.</span> <small>(0.712)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t
have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea
is that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly
where that is.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment,
and then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them,
and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Right.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then, yesterday.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">there were merger reform finalizations
from the other bank regulators.</span> <small>(0.785)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger?</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair
Barr.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jennifer, for the last question.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration
strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even
though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly
balanced.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given what you’ve said, though, today, I’m curious, are you more worried about the
job market and growth than inflation?</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are they not roughly balanced?</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had a historically tight labor
market, historically tight.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we
had inflation way above target.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation,
concentrate on inflation.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put
in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Part of
bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor
market.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what that tells
you is, it’s time to change our stance.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we did that.</span> <small>(0.392)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The sense of the change in the stance is
that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And today
was—I think we made a good strong start on that.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it was the right decision, and I think it
