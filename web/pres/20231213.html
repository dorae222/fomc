Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 13, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been
made toward our dual-mandate objectives.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come
without a significant increase in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s very good news.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But inflation is still too
high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As
we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Our actions have moved our policy rate well into
restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity
and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that
we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will make decisions about the extent of any
additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from
the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Even so, GDP is on track to expand around
Page 1 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving
supply conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>After picking somewhat over the—up somewhat over the summer, activity in
the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business
fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants
revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median
projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the
supply of workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly
for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Although
the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available
workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing
upward pressures on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises
somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose
2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and
energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 2 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need
to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our
goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a
broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from
financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation
all the way to 2 percent will take some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent
this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our restrictive
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle,
the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing
progress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re committed to achieving a stance of
Page 3 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a path to that
objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to
raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and
2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve
as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is
proceeding carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In determining the extent of any additional policy
firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will
take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary
policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-
term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage
for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Chris Rugaber.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted
to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “any” before “additional . . .</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>firming” in
the statement?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, does that mean that you’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the
Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the
extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy
firming”—that sentence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe
that we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Participants didn’t write down
additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But participants also
didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s really what we were
thinking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Fed
Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several
months could be cutting interest rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree
with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn’t cut
rates if inflation fell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, sir.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, of course, I don’t comment on, on any other officials, even those
who work at the Fed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the way—
the way we’re looking at it is, is really this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When we started out, right, we said the first question
is, how fast to move, and we moved very fast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The second question is, you know, really, how
high to raise the policy rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s really the question that we’re still on here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re, we’re
very focused on that, as I—as I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People generally think that we’re at or near that and,
and think it’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’t take that possibility off the table.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s—when you get to that question, and that’s your answer, there’s a natural—naturally, it
begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back
the amount of policy restraint that’s in place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s really the next question, and that’s what people are thinking about and, and
talking about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I would just say this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that
appears to be moderating; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so
many measures; and we’re seeing inflation making real progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These are the things we’ve
been wanting to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We still have a ways to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No one is declaring victory.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That would be premature.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we can’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re,
we’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
that’s, that’s really the question that we’re on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, of course, the other question, the question of
when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place,
that, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion—topic of discussion out in the
world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it, it comes up in this way today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everybody wrote down
an SEP forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So many people mentioned what their—what their rate forecast was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there
was no back-and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like, “This is what I wrote down;
this is what I think,” that kind of thing, and a preliminary kind of a discussion like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not
everybody did that, but many people did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then, and I would say, there’s a general
expectation that this will be—this will be a topic for us, looking ahead.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That, that’s really what
happened in today’s meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I can’t do the head count for you in real time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s generally
what happened today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a
recession and isn’t heading for one now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if the answer is “no,” I’m curious about what
you’d still be looking for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the
economy is in a recession now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next
year, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s always a
real possibility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I have always felt, since the
beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could
cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that
have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So far, that’s what we’re
seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This result is not
Page 7 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
guaranteed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is—it is far too early to declare victory.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there are certainly risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s
certainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has done that
repeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, where we are is, is we
see the things that I—that I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m curious, if you’re looking back on the past year, you talked
about “navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you talk about some of the ways in
which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way
and had to pivot to respond?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very
broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And not only did that not happen—that
includes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of
forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually
had a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on
the supply side.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked
up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages
and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we had significant supply-side gains with
strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth
year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just
because of the healing on the supply side.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that was a surprise to just about everybody.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but
in a very different setting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has
also been significantly better.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a
Page 8 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
significant increase in, in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It didn’t really happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re still at 3.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So
we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that’s coming back into
balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a—you
know, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for
taking the questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what—on what
motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’s a coincidence, for example, that the spread
between PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you’re expecting, in
the rate of inflation that you’re expecting as opposed to supporting the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nothing quite that mechanical is happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The SEP really is, is a
bottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think people are looking at what’s happening
in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is
that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know,
really significantly in three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a big piece of, of this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time, [real GDP]
growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now it] is slowing, we believe, as,
as appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again,
significant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re
seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But so I think that
people look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast
and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We tabulate them and, and publish it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so it’s
not—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 9 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, that’s—that is—that is something that we’re very
conscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we
think about things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as you well
know, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how
tight policy is at any given time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you
would get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is
declining as we—as we move forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has, has
already kind of begun.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering, just related to, to Steve’s question, how the—how the
tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into
2024, the closer you get to a presidential election.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you want to front-load this, in other
words?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
don’t think about politics.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to think,
what’s the right thing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time
we—when we think is the right time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we’ll always do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I mentioned we’re moving carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One of the things we’re moving carefully about
is that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough,
really.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s us thinking that
we have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to
Page 10 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, it’s not the base case anymore,
obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s how we’re—that’s how we’re
approaching things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks
about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start
to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having
going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time
goes forward.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, you’ve
argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the
market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The market is now easing policy
on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that’s a full point below the
current level, with cuts beginning around March.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is this something that you are broadly
comfortable with?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw
thing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and
moving back and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what
we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really
focus on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going
to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in any case,
we have to do what we think is right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned
or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course,
Page 11 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
because we will do what it takes to get to our goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, ultimately, that will mean that
financial conditions will, will come along.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in the meantime, there can be back-and-forth,
and, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And my colleagues are
focused on that, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Do
you believe we’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Listen, I welcome the progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s, it’s really good to see the
progress that we’re making.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures,
you see very low numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That isn’t to say—
I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just need to see more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
need to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s what we need to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And that—it’s one of our two
jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re very focused on, on, you
know, doing that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re pleased with the
progress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is
a lot of uncertainty about going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen the economy move in surprising
directions, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If
growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than
Page 12 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Or, put another way, is below-trend
growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth is one thing,
so is inflation, so is labor market data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’d, we’d look at the totality.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we—as we make
decisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and,
particularly, about the—as they affect the outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and
the balance of risks as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’ll be good for the
labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we
will set policy according to what we actually see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and so that’s how I would answer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess the—I guess the question I’m asking, if you don’t mind a
quick follow-up, I guess the question I’m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s only a
problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know, if you
have—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor
market very strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That could
mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That could mean we need to keep rates
higher for longer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It just is—
it’s the way, the way our policy works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Neil.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do you interpret the state
of the labor market right now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, in particular, you’ve referred even today to evidence that
Page 13 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it’s coming into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that
balance?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s—
you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given
population growth and labor force participation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The things that are not quite—but let me go on
with that list.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, claims are low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re—
sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and
they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at shortages of
workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to
it, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation,
unemployment—so many measures: the unemployment—job openings, quits, all of those
things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation
over a long period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>They’ve been gradually cooling off.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if wages are running around
4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I guess there, there are just a couple of
other—the unemployment rate is very, very low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And these are—but, but I would just say,
overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s been a good time for
workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I’d say the mood among
economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat
corroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a soft landing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yet when
Page 14 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
we—when we hear from the general public, there’s a lot of discord about economic conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It may be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down,
and that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Prices of some, some goods and
services are coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So people are
still living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And,
you know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now
positive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that might help improve the mood of people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The thing that we can do is
to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits
over such long periods of time, and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and
achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families
and, and companies around the country.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I wanted to ask, you know, on,
on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start
to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we’re seeing now, how would you
all think about that in terms of rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Would that be a sign that you’ve, you’ve done your job
demand-wise?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry—if?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If, if the economy starts to—looks like it’s starting to fall into a
recession; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 15 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not something we’re hoping to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Obviously, we’re hoping
to, to see something very different—which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the
labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment,
inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating
without a significant increase in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we’re, we’re trying very much to
achieve and not something that we’re looking to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of
the data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the
beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on
that decision.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr.
Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight
inflation, and you said earlier, again, “the full effects of our tightening (cycle) have not yet been
felt.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’re not behind the
curve there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
we do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of
overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on
the price-stability mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do
Page 16 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
when you’re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates—you’re getting now
back to the point where both mandates are important, and they’re, they’re more in balance, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, we’re, we’re
obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see the same
thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in
2023.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next
year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you see what the forecasts are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think the median growth—median participant wrote
down 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s very hard to predict.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We’ll also
be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but
ideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be
essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and
error, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really
specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used
in, I guess, 2013.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really
worked out yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence of Fox
Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is, is showing, about 75 basis points, does that
signal that there’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 17 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It wouldn’t, if that were to—first of all, let me just say, that isn’t a
plan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s not something—you
know this, but allow me to say it again: We don’t debate or discuss what the right, you know,
whose SEP is right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So and
it’s, you know, it’s important for people to know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it wouldn’t need to be a sign of—it
could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn’t need the tight policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
depends on—the economy can evolve in many different ways, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So but, but it could be
more of what I just described.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And you focused on core inflation, we’ve heard from—in
other meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How sticky is core inflation right now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve
seen real progress in, in core inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is
thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which
was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are seeing some progress
there, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing:
goods, housing services, nonhousing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re all contributing in different—at different
levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, yeah.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Catarina.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CATARINA SARAIVA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this,
you know, this morning and yesterday.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the
forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking,
you know, on the inflation outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 18 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we got—we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we
got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s
very late in the game, you know, to—but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to
update their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>After that, so staff has to—has to
cumulate all of that and create the documents that you see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So until about midmorning, a little,
maybe late morning, it’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast
based on what we saw today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And do you see—I mean, how are you, when you think
about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do
you, you know, how do you think about the economy we’re in now kind of post-pandemic?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do
you think that there’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look
at a rate cut path?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question of whether there have been fundamental structural
shifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The one that
would affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate
of interest is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to
have risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey
the same level of restriction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The thing is, we’re not really going to know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s just
that it’s going to be uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really
unprecedented environment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the
natural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy
Page 19 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
operates with a lag.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We started
slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s—
you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it
doesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Maybe people just bought so
much stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They haven’t got anyplace to put it.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Jennifer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to
2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On a six-
month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and
shelter, they are, of course, stickier.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when looking in the different components of the data,
how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates
is that policy would be, it would be too late.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the
economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,
if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it takes—it
takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I can’t give you a precise answer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you
know, I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would
take.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to identify any one precise
point, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be
right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Jean Yung.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEAN YUNG.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jean Yung with Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to go back to
the stickiness-of-inflation question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have
talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it’s also
been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m curious, do you think something
has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or is it
something different about the U.S. economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think—I think this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we felt since the beginning that it
would be a combination of two factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what
happened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And the second thing would
be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the
supply side to recover because of lower demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We thought those two things were going to be
necessary.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If there was something different about the U.S. economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the
U.S. economy being different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload,
pot-boiling-over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was a combination of very
strong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but
Page 21 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is just very
unusual.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, you know, we had the view—my colleagues and I broadly had the view—that we
could get a lot of—you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve, because you ran into
the limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren’t workers and because people
couldn’t—the supply chains were all broken.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we, we had the view that you could come
straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you
know, something like that has happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It happened so far.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question is, you know, once,
once that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort
of supply chain and shortages side has some, some ways to run—does labor force participation
have much more to run?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It might.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Immigration could help, but it may be that, at some point—at
some point, you will run out of supply-side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets
harder.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s very possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be
different, I’d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
just don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, inflation keeps coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market keeps getting back
into balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And it’s so far, so good—although we kind of assume that it will get harder from
here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But so far, it hasn’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll go to Megan for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’s focus now on
proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And can you talk us through what the latest
thinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening
at all?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 22 of 24

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now,
just to get that out of the way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What we’ve been
seeing is, you know, that we’re allowing runoff each month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s adding up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’re
down—we’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s showing up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The reverse repo facility [take-
up] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or—as a result—or
holding steady.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At a certain point, you know, there won’t be any more to come out of, or there’ll
be a level where [take-up at] the reverse repo facility levels out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, at that point, reserves will
start to come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we still have—you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until
we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that
consistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the
balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with
ample reserves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion
[dollars].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not—we don’t think we’re at those [levels judged consistent with ample]
reserves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There isn’t a lot of evidence of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re watching it carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, so
far—so far, it’s working pretty much as expected, we think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time
you’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that time to rethink, or are you
still going to follow that thinking?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re asking,
though, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such
time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the answer is,
Page 23 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it depends on the reason.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, if you’re—if you’re—if you’re cutting rates because you’re
going back to normal, that’s one thing, [and distinct from] if you’re cutting them because the
economy is really weak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you can imagine, you’d have to know what the reason is to know
whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks very much.</div>
