Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 18, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our, our goals over the past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state and remains solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To that end, today, the Federal Open
Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by
lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We also decided to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a—at a solid
pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the
second quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in
equipment and intangibles has strengthened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been
weak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.
economy over the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants
generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over
the next few years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier
in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate is
higher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nominal

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, a
broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in
2019.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median
projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and
4.3 percent over the next few years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and
2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thereafter, the median
projection falls to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on
both sides of our mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds
rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼-4½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral
setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing
further progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With today’s action, we
have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is
Page 2 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now significantly less restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further
adjustments to our policy rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering the extent and timing of additional
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not on any preset course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their
individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each
participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The median participant projects
that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and
3.4 percent at the end of 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These median projections are somewhat higher than in
September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These projections, however, are not a
Committee plan or decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If the economy remains strong and inflation
does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more
slowly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly
than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy is well positioned to deal with the
risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility
to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate—its typical configuration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 3 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, and I look forward to your
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for taking
our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’s appropriate
to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what
would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Would a January cut potentially be
possible, or does a pause next month seem more likely?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and
then—and then move to 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it
was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of
our goals, maximum employment and price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We see the risks as two-sided: moving too
slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly
and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re trying to steer between those two
risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I’ll give you some
details on why.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is
now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and
orderly way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to
2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold
unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as
surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor
market than there was, than we had in 2019.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s still quite gradually cooling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we keep an
eye on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we’ve
made a great deal of progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November
is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Twelve—but 12-month inflation
has actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we
might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for
goods.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent
and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at
which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You ask about 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year
really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that
inflation will be higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we
see as higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think
the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
We’re, we’re going to react to data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks
is likely to be appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you
make those cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this
way: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re significantly closer to
neutral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But as
for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as
continued strength in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And as long as the economy and the labor market are
solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And all of that is reflected—to
your question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next
year, compared to four in September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the
opportunity to ask you a question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the
last transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in
part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s
the split on this one?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in,
and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I’d say—I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start—let
me start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place, and we think policy’s in a
really good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that
Page 6 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation has come down by 50 percent to, to—from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Headline
inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re actually in a really good starting place here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First
thing is growth is stronger, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so
far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next
year as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants
think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that’s, that’s more
strength, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation is higher, as we talked about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation’s higher this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also higher in the
forecast next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another
reason to be cautious about, about further moves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And—but then getting to your—to your point,
there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some
people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of
economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some
people said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we
have people making a bunch of different approaches to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But some did identify policy
uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the
path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking
into a dark room full of furniture.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You just slow down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that may have affected some of
the people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 7 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and
uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The upside risk to inflation jumped quite
substantially.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the
disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The only
real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is it fair to say that that’s what’s
driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What’s happened
is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in
September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, November is, is back on track.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, once again we’ve, you know,
we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached
the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I can tell you that
might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to
expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s way below
where it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I
mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s
in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing
inflation down and keeping a solid labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking
the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking
Page 8 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through” any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations
remained anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other
thinking on tariffs generally that you can share?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative
simulations are a good place to start.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I happened to have brought them here with me today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m
sure you have them too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you
know, it’s six-years-old analysis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right
questions to ask.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing
through,” one was not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see-
through” paragraph.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to
“see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not
be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we won’t face that
question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What the Committee’s doing now is, is
discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can
affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, we’re,
we’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it
puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make,
you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy
response.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great, and just a quick follow[-up].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Do you, given the recent bout
of inflation that we’ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and
businesses being—seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a
Page 9 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
little bit riskier to look through tariffs?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, are—do you feel that you have to respond more
quickly to inflation threats, given what we’ve seen the past few years?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative
simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs
will, will even go into consumer inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How persistent will that be?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, so, we
just—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very
premature to try to make any kind of conclusion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what
countries, for how long, and what size.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know,
retaliatory tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be
into consumer prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last
episode is or is not a good model for what happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You pointed out we’ve just been through a
period of high inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve just gotten through that period.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a difference.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was also
quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that
may have affects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a
very careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how
they’re implemented.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re at the
stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions,
but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, to make sure
I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the
central tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the
Page 10 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So if inflation only declines next
year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let me—let me find these numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we have—we have inflation
coming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’d be—that’d
be significant progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You see a slower path.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that does take on board that we want to
see real progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation
down to that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you
know, better than this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That would be meaningful.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We,
we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And while we, we have the
labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very
gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s also something we need to keep our
eye on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these
projections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing” language in the statement, which has
been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it’s going to be on hold for a
while, and they said, “Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,” would they
be mistaken to, to infer that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at
all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let me explain “extent and timing.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if
the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate
to slow the pace of rate cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can
reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Clearly, that distance has
shrunk by 100 basis points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s significantly smaller.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s the “extent” question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 11 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And, again, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor
market, to make those cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>“Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy
develops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of
adjustments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that’s what we mean by that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not trying to make decisions about the
longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I
just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that
we expect significant policy changes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s nothing really unusual about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we need
to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll, we’ll have a
much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Even
though you’ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven’t seen much change in
mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You say you’re significantly restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you
running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of
a slowdown than you anticipate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are,
are really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,
but they’re also affected by many other things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And longer rates have actually gone up quite a
bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example,
mortgage rates more than short-term rates do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at that, but we look at all financial
conditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what we see happening in
the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth
Page 12 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
for a very long time, and it keeps not happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we have—we’re now well into another year
of growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It looks like it might be 2½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Third and—second and third quarters were right
about at the same level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Substantially
better than our global peer group.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I—there’s no reason to think a downturn is, is any
more likely than it—than it usually is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We have to stay on task, though, and
continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re also
going to be looking out for the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to keep the labor market pretty close to
where it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job
creation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so
that’s what our policy’s trying to achieve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up by asking about—your formulation for
beginning rate cuts included the phrase “we need to have confidence that inflation is moving
down towards our target.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Given the fact that you’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you
have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve
made—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re, you
know, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than
that, we have been—for headline inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has
come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why
that portends well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You, again, you do see with housing
services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down
now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s
Page 13 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
nonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate
better with, you know, new leases that turn over.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not, not new tenants, but new leases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Market
rents is new leases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it
was before the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way
because of used cars and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we think, overall, that should generally be in the
range it was in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are
in, in good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed
rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much
about the, you know, about tightness in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>They don’t really reflect that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, a
good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that,
that’s how that inflation works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s, it is cooler by so many measures
now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So
it’s not a source of inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know,
particular professions where labor is tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses
of any significance from the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what’s the story?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that
the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in
insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing
insurance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we and most
other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It might
Page 14 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take another year or two from here, but I, I’m confident that that’s the path we’re on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you
know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So the
unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level
that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the
50 basis point cut in September.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But now
the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what has changed
about the Committee’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Is there just less
concern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now
needs to be accounted for?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in
July: 4.2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And job creation is, is
lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s been
steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would
hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you might—you might—if,
if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that
level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of
thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So gradually declining.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We, we do think the
labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s, it’s not
cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think, you know, you pointed
out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative
Page 15 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
to the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it
doesn’t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, you know, we’re
watching it closely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the
labor market is welcome here, what’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get
to 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t need it, we
don’t think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few
months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent
months been moving sideways in the 12-month window.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we’ve got to weigh them both,
at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused
on, on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we
think are broadly, roughly in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that’s how we think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word “recalibration”
today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this
new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it
was before.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we may get
around to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I
said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis
points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re significantly closer to neutral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We still think where we are is meaningfully,
meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move
Page 16 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
cautiously and look for progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support
economic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that’s a good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I think it would—I
support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think from now we are
in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it is kind of a new thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We moved pretty quickly
to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is
consistent with, with the SEP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the
Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we’ve had in the recent inflation
numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the
avian flu, that, that kind of stuff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation
coming down, as it did in the recent report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the
numbers we don’t like, you know?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], “Look, those
high months are wrong.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What about the low months?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ve got, we have a very
low month, potentially, in November.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens
for core PCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that could be idiosyncratically low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We try to look—we try to look at not just
a couple or three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We shouldn’t have—our, our position shouldn’t change based on two
or three months of good or bad data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We have a long string now of inflation coming down
gradually over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it’s 12-month headline’s 2½; 12-month
core is 2.8.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s way better than we were.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We still have some work to do, though, is how
we’re looking at it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get—to get that work done,
we think.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin from Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Financial markets
have been very buoyant, really all year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the Committee comfortable with where financial
conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine
progress on your inflation target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s
part of what we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our—
of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what we’ve seen over the
course of—just take the last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of
years—come down a lot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That suggests that
our policy is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected
by—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Housing activity is, is very low,
and that’s partly, significantly because of our policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we think our policy is working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s
transmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, a
lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the
places where we’d expect to see it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do
you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we, we’re not allowed to own Bitcoin.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Federal
Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re, we’re not looking for a, a law change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s the
kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ANDREW ACKERMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’re confident
that we’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years
ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s pretty clear we’ve avoided a recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think growth
this year has, has been solid, it really has.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which
we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real
growth] this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is a really good number.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, the U.S. economy has just been
remarkable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the
story, is that how well the U.S. is doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you look around the world, there’s just a lot of
slow growth and continued struggles with inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I feel—I feel very good about where the
economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the—you, you
guys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>However, employment rates have
fallen rather quickly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point—half a
percent, rather—recently.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The question, I guess, is, do you think there’s maybe more downside
momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think so, no.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age
participation is still very high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is
low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you are looking
for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come
Page 19 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further
softening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I didn’t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in
the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you
know, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the
action, with, with an additional cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is
very low—again, participation is high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable
level—wage growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you
know, we want to keep it that way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Amara.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>AMARA OMEOKWE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just
want to put a finer point on the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Can you keep the labor market this way, in the
strong position that you have described, without further cuts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In other words, do you still view
the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I,
I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in
balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, job creations are, are
meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be
sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you, if you take into account
the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to
2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the
downsides clearly appear to have diminished.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals,
Page 20 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually
cooling—gradually and in an orderly way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, that’s, that’s how I would
characterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Elizabeth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks so much, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Elizabeth Schulze from ABC
News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>As you’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>High prices are
still a burden for so many households right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Why do you think it is that inflation is proving
to be more stubborn than you’d expected?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it
just has been a little bit more stubborn.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think if you go back two or three years, many people
were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you
know, high unemployment by now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path
down has actually been much better than many predicted.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We, we’ve managed to, to have the
unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come
down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a
12-month basis.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why hasn’t it come down [more]?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around
the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents
have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two
years ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s part of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I
think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we, we
understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s
Page 21 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s
tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This was everywhere in all the
advanced economies at the same time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but
people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The best
we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and
keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their
wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year
upon year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what it
will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the
biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly,
I’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place; our
policy’s in a really good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I expect another good year next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward
Lawrence from Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you say that we’re closer to the neutral rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What percent do
you see, and the Committee believes—where is that neutral rate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll say a couple things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First of all, when we, when we write—
the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate,
which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in
balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is not where we are right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when
we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you can’t do a
Page 22 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
straight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the
appropriate policy should be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and
we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s
having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are
lasting but not permanent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually
affect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re
looking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say,
we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points
closer to it right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot
closer to it, and I think we’re in a good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re
going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little
more clarity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I, I think
the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where
that, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models
of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There, there are empirical models,
there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different
answers as you’d like.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there is no real certainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing
to know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh,
Page 23 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
I think this model or this estimate is right.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You, you just have to be open to, you know, the
empirical data that are coming in and also how it’s affecting the outlook.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s not made any
easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s
appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to,
to neutral, and we’ll do so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these
cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make
progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just wanted to make sure I
understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Are you saying that progress
on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then also,
since that’s what’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Why, why do
you all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is
headline inflation, because that’s what people experience.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People don’t experience core
inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s the overall
goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can
fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really
good predictors of future inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of
overall inflation than overall inflation is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at core inflation because it’s a better
measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of
Page 24 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
what inflation pressures exist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s—it’s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know,
our goal is headline, not core.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So your question was, your second question was what?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially
ticking up?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mm-hmm.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and
food prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with
forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year,
then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it—that, that’s why
the two can go in different directions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year,
but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything
about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’re thinking about
energy prices?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know,
but—really carefully, rather.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven’t really—
nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States
economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking
about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary
statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the price of
oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we
Page 25 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly,
at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it remains, you know, a risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kelly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KELLY O’GRADY.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kelly O’Grady from CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I want to
go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
wasn’t the case for some time, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s partly why Americans haven’t felt much relief in
their wallets from prices yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in
closing that gap could go away?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months
of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we, what we had was—we had
four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then
November is much lower.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising
upside risk to inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I, I think inflation is much lower.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What the public is feeling, and they’re
right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your,
your real compensation is growing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, in other words, your compensation’s growing
meaningfully faster than inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just
want to hold onto it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That, that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what’s
going on right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation
really signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s now been pushed out to
Page 26 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
2027.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You said you’re focused on enabling further progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not necessarily
progress in the right direction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you confident that target isn’t going to move further out?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you
know, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Very high
uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently
predict where the economy is going to be in three years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So what we’re doing is we’re looking at
what’s happening now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are
happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods
and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their,
their prior level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces
come together.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s every reason to think that they will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The timing of it is highly uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit
frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, we’re still on track.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d
said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people
would be, would say, “I’ll take that.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job’s
not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Go to Nancy for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer from
Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it
appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you think the Fed is just going to
have to settle for that and accept that you’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 27 of 28

December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, we’re not going to settle for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think we’re, we’re, you
know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we’ll get inflation back
sustainably to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is—and I am confident we will achieve that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has taken longer,
but it’s, you have to be—you know, we are making progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have made a great deal of
progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we owe
the public.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, we’re committed to achieving it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’re at 4.3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That’s, that’s
meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make
progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—Thank you very much.</div>
