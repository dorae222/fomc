Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
January 29, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is strong—is strong overall and has made significant
progress toward our goals over the past two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Labor market conditions have cooled from
their formerly overheated state and remain solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has moved much closer to our
2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more
to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>For 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer
spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter
but was strong for the year overall.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the
housing sector seems to have stabilized.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the labor market, conditions remain solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per
month over the past three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has
stabilized since the middle of last year and, at 4.1 percent in December, remains low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal
wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Overall, a
wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The
labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated
relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Estimates based on the consumer price index and other
Page 1 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and
that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We see the risks to achieving our
employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on
both sides of our mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full
percentage point from its peak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light
of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With our policy stance
significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need
to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly
weaken economic activity and employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In considering the extent and timing of additional
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not on any preset course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes
our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy remains—economy
remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can
Page 2 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
maintain policy restraint for longer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or
inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy is
well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our
dual mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we previously announced, our five-year review, review of our monetary policy
framework is taking place this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by
reviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the
experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our review will again include
outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events
around the country and a research conference in May.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Throughout this process, we will be open
to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in
determining our findings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would note that
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be a focus
of the review.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-run inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, all
right, at an event in Davos—or from, to Davos, anyway—the President said he’ll demand that
interest rates drop immediately.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I have a three-part question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Has the President done
this to you?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Has he made that demand?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Secondly, what is your response to that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, third,
what effect, if anything—if any, does a President making these kind of remarks have on policy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Three questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m seeing, seeing it really as one question, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, I, I’m not going to have—I’m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever
on, on what the President’s said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not appropriate for me to do so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The public should be
confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have—focusing on using our tools
to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s how we
best serve the public.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you just comment on whether he’s physically communicated
his demand to you?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve had no contact.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, you and
several of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was
“meaningfully restrictive.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given economic and financial market developments since then, how
has your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully
restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think that my assessment really has changed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, a
couple of things have happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve gotten more strong data, but we’ve also seen rates move
up at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think if we look
back over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If you look at the effect of
high rates on interest-sensitive spending—for example, in housing—and if you look at the
achievement of our goal variables, we’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation
and, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Though we literally look at the—at
the—at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, policy is
meaningfully less restrictive than it was before we began to cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s 100 basis points less
restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on
inflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we—before we consider
making adjustments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Does the economy here warrant meaningfully
restrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if
you were to lower them by another ¼ point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, I, I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I
mentioned, to balance the achievement of our two—of our two goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We, we want to—policy
to be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation
goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>At the same time, we don’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve
that goal, and that’s kind of what we’ve been getting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The labor market has really been broadly
stable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Conditions seem to
be broadly in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see
we don’t—we don’t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, nonetheless, the
Page 5 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
last couple of readings have suggested, you know, more positive readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think we’re—I
think policy’s well, well positioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby, from the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith, with the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, how should we
interpret the removal of the line from the statement that inflation has made progress towards the
2 percent goal?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that no longer the case?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, so let me look—if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a
little bit of language cleanup there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We took out a reference to “since earlier in the year” as it
related to the labor market, and we just chose to, to shorten that sentence.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, I, I mean, if
you look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was—there was another
inflation reading, I guess, just before the December meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, we’ve got two, two good
readings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Again, we’re not going to
overinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than
this: You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving
our 2 percent inflation goal sustainably.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And just to follow up: We’ve seen inflation expectations across a
number of measures rise sharply—which has, in part, been linked to tariff concerns.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But there’s
also been this encouraging data that you mentioned in terms of CPI and rent indices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So how
would you characterize concerns about upside risks to inflation across the Committee, especially
those tied to policies related to the Trump Administration?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well I, I’d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the
short end—but not at the longer run, which [is] where it really matters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And those could be
related to—could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think where the
Page 6 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Committee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, and we,
we don’t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with
regulatory policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re only just beginning to see—actually, are not really beginning to see
much, and I think we need to—we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even
begin to make a, a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
we’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is no different than any
other set of policy changes at the beginning of a—of an Administration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll patiently watch
and understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of
understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You and
your colleagues normally condition future policy moves with the phrase, “if the economy
develops as we anticipate.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it fair to say that since there’s a lot unknown about what this
Administration’s fiscal policies are actually going to be that you don’t have a medium- to long-
term economic forecast that you can have confidence in?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or, if that’s not true, can you lay out
what you think is going to happen in the economy, how you see it developing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, at all times—at all times, forecasts are conditional, at a
minimum, on just a set of expectations, and, and they’re highly uncertain in both directions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We,
we know that economic forecasting is, is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So in
the current situation, there’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of, of, you know,
significant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned: tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal
policy, and, and regulatory policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that
should be passing; we should go through that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then we’ll be back to the regular amount of
Page 7 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, what, what forecasters are doing—not just us, but everybody’s doing—is
they’ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they’re really kind of
in the nature of a placeholder, and—meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you
wouldn’t stand behind it because you just don’t know, and so you’re just—you’re just on hold,
waiting to see what comes down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s, it’s a very large economy, and policies affect
it at the margin, but we’ll, you know, we’re going to wait and see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The idea that you feel the—that policy is
restrictive suggests that the Fed, in general, wants to continue to lower interest rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when
you look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can
cut or data that will tell you [that] you should hold?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re—we’re looking—it’s more the other—the way—
the way it works is, we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know,
that, that’s what we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Policy’s well
positioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy’s in, in quite a good place, actually, as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And what, what we do
expect is to see further progress on inflation, and, you know, as I mentioned, as we see that—or
if we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster—we could then be in a position
of, of making further adjustments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, right now, we, we don’t see that, and we see things as in
a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a
hurry to, to make any adjustments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
2021, at a central bank conference, you said, quote, “Throughout my career in both public and
private sectors, I’ve seen that the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that
Page 8 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These organizations
consistently attract the best talent by investing in and retaining a world-class workforce.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Question, first question is, do you still believe that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if so, how do you intend to put that
belief into practice while remaining consistent with the recent executive order prohibiting
diversity and inclusion efforts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say, “yes,” in answer to your first question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, to the
second question, I want to say this: We are, like others, we’re reviewing the orders and the
associated details as they are made available.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And as has been our practice over many
Administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate
and consistent with applicable law.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I want to add that I’m not going to have anything more
specific for you today on this whole set of issues.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, if I could just follow up quickly on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering
how you’re getting that to be consistent with the Dodd-Frank law’s stipulations about
maintaining an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I did—I did mention “consistent with applicable law,” right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Which is governing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Elizabeth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ELIZABETH SCHULZE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks so much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just to
follow up on Steve’s question, what reassurance can you give the American public that the Fed
will continue to operate independent of politics under this Administration?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I’ve—as I’ve said countless times over the years, this
is—this is who we are; this is what we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We study the data, we, we analyze how it will affect
the outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,
Page 9 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
our best thinking, try to achieve our goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we do; that’s always what we do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Don’t
look for us to do anything else.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—you know, lots of research shows that’s the—that’s
the best way for a central bank to operate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’ll give us the best possible chance to achieve
these goals for the benefit of the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s always what we’re going to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
people should have confidence in that, as I—as I said a few minutes ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve said that the Fed is in wait-and-see mode, based on
the policies that come out of this Administration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Has the Fed started to model what policies like
mass deportations, changes in immigration policy, specifically, would look like for the
workforce and for inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So one of the things our, our staff does is they, they look at a range
of possible outcomes, and, and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you
know, it’s, it’s one of the best things that they do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And in each Tealbook—you can look at the
five-year-old Tealbooks and see their alternative simulations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what they do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They, it’ll
be a baseline, and then they’ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones
and, and not-so-good ones.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And what those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to
sort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So,
yes, we, we—staff does that, and we, we’re all well aware that there are—that the range of
possibilities is always broad, and—not just now, but always.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you have to—it’s hard to be
open to just how, how broad the possibilities are for an economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, no one saw the
pandemic coming, and it was—you know, it changed everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So things happen, and—but
yes, we do—we do do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what
might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’t act until

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, last month
you talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more
progress in inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would
you say that that’s even more so the case now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’d say it’s the same.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, we, we want to see, you know,
further progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, the story’s there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s—we’re just going to
have to see the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the end of the day, it, it comes down to 12-month inflation, because that
takes out the seasonality issues that may exist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’re, we’re just going to need
to see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think that—we think we see the pathway for that to happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One, one
example—a key example—is that you now do see owner’s equivalent rent and, you know,
housing services—the way it’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty
steadily now, and that’s the—that’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
addition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services
[prices], which don’t tend to send much signal [about future inflation].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you can look through
all that and, and think, “Okay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But being
seem to set up for it is one thing; having it is another.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we, we’re going to want to see further,
further progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Remember, we’re not, you know, we’re, we’re under—2 percent,
but our goal is 2 percent, and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and in terms of the labor market, I mean, how—is that
broadly—you know, you said a broad set of indicators show that it’s in pretty solid place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was
there broad agreement on that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s been a few underlying indicators that are showing
Page 11 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
perhaps some weakness: a low hiring rate, you know, workers reporting that it’s increasingly
difficult to find a job.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that of concern to the Committee?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, we look at, of course, a very broad range.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, so, it starts with unemployment—sorry, with, yeah, with the unemployment rate,
employment participation, wages, job quits—are people quitting?—that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The ratio
of vacancies to unemployed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger, though,
on—it’s a low—it’s a low-hiring environment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if you have a job, it’s all—it’s all good, but if
you—if you have to find a job, the job-finding rate—the hiring rates have come down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And
that’s, that’s more typical of a—let’s say—let’s say that the unemployment—that the—that the
labor market is at a sustainable level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not overheated anymore.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t think we need it to
cool off anymore.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do watch it extremely carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s one of our two goal variables.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But,
yeah, I, I’d say we watch those things quite carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But nonetheless, overall, look at the
aggregate data in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It does seem to—the labor market does seem, seem to be
pretty stable and broadly in balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>When you’ve got a, an unemployment rate that is—that has
been pretty stable now for, for a, a full half a year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>On employment, now, you said there’s a broad range of possibilities, but last
September you said, quote, “We understand that there’s been quite an influx across the borders,
and that has actually been one of things that’s allowed unemployment rate to rise.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Now that the
flow over the border has slowed and we’re seeing deportations, how do you expect the
unemployment rate to react?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 12 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, so what’s happening is that the, the flows across the
border have decreased very significantly, and there’s every reason to expect that to continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And so—but job creation has come down a bit, too, so, you know, if those two things come
down together, that, that sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In other
words, a breakeven rate—as, as population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in
new jobs to make—to, to make jobs for, for workers declines as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that seems to be
something about what’s happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You, you do see a very—a very flat unemployment rate at a
time when you’ve seen significant declines [in job growth].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I want to ask you about Fed employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I know that tax
money is not used here, but Elon Musk alleges that the Fed is, quote, “absurdly overstaffed.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen the Executive Branch push to reduce the federal workforce.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just want to get your
reaction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we run a very careful budget process where we’re
fully aware that what, that, you know, we owe the—we owe that to the public, and we believe we
do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I’ve got no further comment than that, thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>President Trump has said he
will lower inflation by reducing gas and energy costs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you see such costs as a particular
driver of inflation, and would lowering them have a dramatic effect?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris, I’m not going to—I’m not going to react or discuss anything
that, that any elected politician might say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll give you a mulligan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, oh, thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, nearly two weeks ago the Fed said it
was withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System even as, you know, even
Page 13 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
as we have significant wildfires in Los Angeles doing billions of dollars in damage.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of
course, the NGFS, as you know, is a group to talk about how the financial system could address
climate change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many commentators did see the timing as political.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why did you leave that
organization?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you explain that decision?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sure, I’d be glad to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we considered this, you know, really at
length, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, really, the reason is that the, the
work that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Think about nature-related risks and
biodiversity and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, the, the work of the NGFS is, is, in, in significant
part intended to—and this is a quote—“mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition
toward a sustainable economy.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we joined to get the benefit of understanding what other
central banks were doing and, and seeing research and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think this is just way
beyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow
role, as I’ve—as I’ve said many times, and I think that, that the activities of the NGFS are not a
good fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, and I just think it
was time to acknowledge that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the, the process—this process dates back—thinking
about it dates back a couple of years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I made the decision to bring this to the Board, you know,
some months ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It just—it just—the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when—
this is when we, we got in and voted on it, so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m aware of how it can look, but it was
really not driven by politics; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the
NGFS and our mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have no, no criticism of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it just isn’t—it’s not right for the Fed.</div>

ANDREW ACKERMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m
wondering if you could talk more about what further progress would look like for consumers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, 2 percent—inflation down to—inflation down to 2 percent
sustainably is what, what we’re trying to achieve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, we’re, we’re somewhat above that,
as you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that
we’re making further progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And consumers will,
will pick that up, of course, in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ANDREW ACKERMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you
think you are from neutral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, you can’t know with any precision, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I like to say,
that you know that—you know the neutral rate by its works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent
we’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee’s estimates of the longer-run
neutral.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s really the question we ask.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you can consult models, empirical models,
theoretical models.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You really have to just look out the window and see how your—how your
policy rate is affecting the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I think we see that it’s having meaningful effects in
bringing inflation under control.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
that’s what we think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I would say we’re meaningfully above it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I am—I, I have no illusion
that, that anyone knows precisely how much that is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, but it, you know—not knowing that,
and having cut 100 basis points, means that it’s appropriate that we—that we not be in a hurry to
make further adjustments.</div>

VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, as a general matter, when it
comes to executive orders and OMB memos, do those always apply to the Fed, sometimes,
never, or do you just often voluntarily comply?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is—what is the legality there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s been—it’s been our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align
our policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—I’m just going
to leave it at that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, I’m not going to—I’m not going to go any deeper than that
or, or get into any deeper into this set of issues today.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CLAIRE JONES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire Jones from the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Two questions, if I may, on
tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, first of all, we’ve seen global trade wars before, notably in 2019 last time around.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But then we were then in a very different place on both inflation and growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we see tariffs of
the same sort of magnitude that we got then—which I know is a big if—what do you think might
be different this time around?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, secondly, Tiff Macklem said there was no doubt that the
threat of tariffs was a big driver of the cut by the Bank of Canada today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What sort of
information would the Fed need to see on tariffs before it was willing to take such a preemptive
move?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, make a—?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To—what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you need to see a strategy, actual implementation, actual movement of inflation
expectations, before you’re actually willing to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of
it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we just—so first of all, thing, things are a little different now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve just come through a high-inflation period, and you can argue that both ways.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You can—
Page 16 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but, but we also
hear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and
so I don’t know how that shakes out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, you’re coming through a situation where
we’re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that’s just different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, you know, the trade—the kind of footprint of trade is, has changed a, a lot, as
trade is now spread around the, you know—it’s not as concentrated in China as it was.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There
was a lot more manufacturing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It moved to Mexico and other places.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so there were
differences, and I just think the, the range of possibilities is, is very, very wide.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just don’t
know, and I, I don’t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we didn’t know, by the way, in, I guess, 2018.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, we didn’t really know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it, you
know, the—again, the range of possibilities, very, very wide.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know what’s going to be
tariff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know for how long or how much, what countries.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know about
retaliation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That’s, that really does remain to be seen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, there are lots of places where that—where
that—where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a
consumer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just so many variables.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re just going to have to wait and see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know,
the best we can do is what we’ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at
historical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then
we’ll just have to see—have to see how it—how it goes.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Two unrelated
questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The first is whether or not there was any discussion about QT and the timeline for
ending QT at this meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then the second question is just—I wonder if the AI-prompted
Page 17 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
selloff in the stock market this week signaled anything to you about the state of financial
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, on QT, on—let’s, let’s talk about runoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the most recent data
do suggest that reserves are still abundant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when
runoff began.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And the federal funds rate has been very steady within the target range.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We track
a, a bunch of metrics, and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do intend to
reduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that’s consistent with implementing monetary
policy efficiently and effectively in our ample-reserves regime.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re closely monitoring a, a
range of indicators to assess conditions, and that should provide signals whether reserves are
approaching a level that could be judged as, quote, “somewhat above ample.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I don’t have
anything to say to you about particular dates; it’s just that’s the process, and what we see is, is
that, that rates do appear to be abundant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to
support the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach
for reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On, on AI, it’s a big event in, in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock
market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, what, what really matters for us is macro developments, and that means
substantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I wouldn’t
put that label on, on these events, although of course we’re all watching it with interest.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist, thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
mentioned in your remarks that activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the
same time, since your first rate cut in September, long-term mortgage rates have gone up by a
full percentage point, back above 7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering, kind of looking forward, do you
Page 18 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think—are you confident that activity will remain stable, given how elevated mortgage rates are?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How does it fit into your broader thinking about the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, as you know, as we’ve reduced our, our policy rate 100 basis
points, longer rates have gone up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not because of expectations—not principally because of
expectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, and, you
know, it’s long rates that matter for, for housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I don’t think—I think these higher rates
are going to—they’re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent, if they’re
persistent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll have to see how long they persist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we, we are—we control an
overnight rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Generally, it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including
interest rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in this particular case, it’s all happened at a time when, for reasons unrelated
to our policy, longer rates have moved up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You said you want to see further progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Given that households
appear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should
wait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, I wouldn’t say that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we’ve never said we need to be all the
way at target to reduce rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>At, at any time, what we’re doing is we’re looking at the economy
and asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price
stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think if—we would want to see further progress, but we think our—we think
our—as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Meaningfully restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Not
highly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I would think we need to see further
Page 19 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although
we’d love to see that, of course, and we will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And a separate question for you, on tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Curious
whether the threat of tariffs and not knowing whether they could stick or not creates uncertainty
for business here in the United States and could cause them to pull back, ultimately weighing on
growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does the threat of tariffs cause you to ponder your growth forecast?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we—I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the
conduct of tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s not our job, and it’s not our job to comment on the moves that
people make.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I wouldn’t want to criticize anything that’s happening or really comment on
it one way or another—praise it, for that matter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just not our job.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I do think that—you know, we found in, in 2018, [when] there was a lot of work done on
trade policy uncertainty, trade policy uncertainty, if it’s large and persistent, can start to matter
for businesses making investment decisions and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s not something I’m
observing today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s very early days for this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that did—I think that did matter in 2018–19.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and it’s one, you know, one of many things we’ll be watching.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Matt Egan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MATT EGAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Matt Egan from CNN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Following up on
Courtenay’s question from earlier about the stock market, how concerned are you, if at all, about
potential asset bubble brewing in financial markets?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How do relatively high market valuations
factor into considerations about potentially lowering interest rates further?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that something
that’s in the back of your mind?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we look—we look at, from a financial stability perspective, at
asset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the
Page 20 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
banking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s just one of the four things,
asset prices are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, yeah, I, I’d say they’re elevated by, by many metrics right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A good
part of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we, we look at that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know,
we also—we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are
to those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective, and we think
that there’s a lot of resilience out there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Banks have high capital, and households are actually,
overall—not all households, but in, in the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape
financially these days.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how we think about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, you know, we, we also—we look at
overall financial conditions, and you’ve got—you can’t just take—you can’t just take equity
prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve got to look at rates, too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in
conditions, with higher rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, overall, financial conditions are probably still somewhat
accommodative, but it’s a mixed bag.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Richard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RICHARD ESCOBEDO.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m Richard Escobedo with CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One question for you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>This month’s statement notes that unemployment has stabilized at a low
rate and that the labor market is solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You walked through some of what’s driving this, but I
wonder what risks you see that might challenge your assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, the things we watch, we discussed earlier.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One, one is, is that
there’s a low hiring rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And so that if, if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were
to start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the
hiring rate is quite low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that’s one thing we look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s also—it’s worth pointing out that for lower-income households, they are—
they’re under significant pressure.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And in the aggregate, the numbers are good, but we know
Page 21 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that people at the lower end of the income spectrum are, are struggling with, with costs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
really, it’s, it’s high inflation for the basics of life.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>It’s not so much the inflation now; it’s the
price level, because inflation has raised prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation is now closer—much closer to target,
but people are really feeling that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, overall, this is a good labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Here
you’re at 4.1 percent unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s just a really good level, and you’ve been
solidly there now for six, seven months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold
the unemployment rate there, given, given that, you know, there’ll be much slower population
growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One more question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Some of the uncertainty around
immigration policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is—in your assessment, is that making it harder for businesses and the Fed
to plan going forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we hear anecdotal reports, but I, I don’t see—there’s
nothing in the data yet on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you do—you hear—you hear that kind of thing about
construction, for example.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant
labor are, are saying that it’s, it’s suddenly gotten harder to, to get people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I, again—I
know—you don’t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICHOLAS JASINSKI.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I’m wondering, are there any periods from your
career, or as it relates to markets, the economy, what’s going on here in Washington and beyond,
or from lessons from history, that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in
uncertain times like today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 22 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I guess I’d say this: Uncertainty is, is with us all the time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it is
human nature, apparently, to underestimate the—how fat the tails are, in a way, that, you know,
the, the possibility—we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it’s not a
normal distribution.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your
expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s never not that way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t—you know, if you—if you think about it—
think about the first few months of the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That was uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are we going to be able
to reopen the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If so, when?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How much of it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How long will it take?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, that
was uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What we have now is a good labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have the economy growing at,
you know, 2 to 2½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation’s come down to, to now the, you know—the headline
inflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that’s what the public experiences.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We look at—we look
at core because it’s a better indicator of future inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, yes, the price level went up a lot for
inflation, and people are feeling that, and, and they’re not wrong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I—so the kind of
uncertainty we have is just a, a usual level of uncertainty about the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But then
policies—which are, you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise, really—those are—those are
policies which people are, have been elected to implement.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re implementing them with a
view to, to making a better economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I, I don’t think—I wouldn’t call this out as, as a—
as one of those times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t compare it to the Global Financial Crisis or anything like that,
given that we have actually a very good economy right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EVAN RYSER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Evan Ryser with Market News International.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, is a March
cut still on the table?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And then, additionally, are you looking to see better-than-expected data on
inflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 23 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So, as, as I mentioned, the economy’s strong, the labor market’s
solid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation
continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That tells me and the other members of the
Committee—the broad sense of the Committee, actually, is that we don’t need to be in a hurry to
adjust our policy stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Your second question was?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Whether or not you need to see better-than-expected inflation data or
just inflation data that roughly aligns with your current forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s one of those things we’ll know it when we see it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But
more, more the—the expectation is that we will make continued progress, and, you know, that’s
what we want.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we’ll know it when we see it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When we—it, it’s going to have to be
something that isn’t just idiosyncratic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re going to want to see, you know, continued
progress with housing services inflation; you’re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way
that builds confidence that we are really making progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what it’s going to be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, I
mean, is, is that better than our expectations?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we expect to see that, it’s just a question of
when.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Scott.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SCOTT HORSLEY.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Scott Horsley from NPR.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In your five-year
review, you said the, the 2 percent inflation target won’t be on the table.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you talk a little
about why?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that because you think that’s the right target, or is it because you don’t want to
move the goalpost midgame, or what’s, what’s behind that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think to—I think that goal has served us well over a long period of
time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also the sort of global standard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at
changing that, you wouldn’t do it at a time when you’re not meeting it anyway.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would not look
Page 24 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
at changing it anyway, but I certainly wouldn’t look at, at it at a time when you’re not—when
you’re not meeting it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, there’s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if I’m being at all
unclear.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re not—we’re not going to change the inflation goal any time soon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and five years ago, if I can paraphrase what you all decided, it
was you’re going to not raise interest rates preemptively to, to head off inflation until you see
sort of the whites of the eyes of inflation, because the solid labor market was so beneficial.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Have
the last few years changed your thinking about that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So what we really said was that we wouldn’t—we wouldn’t look at
a—at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So the
thought was that we’d seen really low levels of inflation—sorry, of unemployment—with no
sign of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So why would you preemptively want to—want to put people out of work in
the absence of, of any kind of—any evidence that suggested that, that this was not a sustainable
level?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was a way of, of acknowledging how much humility we have about, about the starred
variables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, that was a—that, that was an
insight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll, we’ll discuss that again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’ll be one of the many things that we discuss.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I
don’t think that insight is wrong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We didn’t—you know, we, we—what we said was that, you
know, in—at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we, we would likely allow
inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That was—
turned out not to be relevant to what actually happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There was nothing moderate about the
overshoot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was—it was an exogenous event.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was the pandemic, and it happened, and, you
know, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that
that’s what we should do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to—we, we
looked at the inflation as, as transitory, and—right up to the point where the data turned against
Page 25 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our, our view, and we raised
rates a lot, and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the
framework was, was more irrelevant than anything else.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The, the, that part of it—that part of it
was irrelevant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The rest of the framework worked just fine as, as we used it, as it supported what
we did to bring inflation down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Go to Mark for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MARK HAMRICK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hello, Chairman Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As you
know, in the annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, among the risks
outlined is cryptocurrency.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could you talk about those risks now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And regarding individuals
and households, perhaps distinct from the concern about the financial system, do you worry that
speculation in this unregulated asset class could hurt their financial well-being, or do you think it
has a place in a household’s portfolio?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, so our, our role with Bitcoin, really, is to look at—with
crypto, really, is to look at the banks, and, and, you know, we, we think it’s—you know, banks
are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks
and its safe, safe and soundness.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many of our—a good number of our banks that we regulate and
supervise do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto
activities, and that’s because they’re so new, and, you know, we don’t want to make the mistake
you’re—if you—if you’re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside
the federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it’s a safe
and sound activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we’re, we’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t
want to, to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, to terminate customers who are
Page 26 of 27

January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
perfectly legal just because of, of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and
supervision, so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And with respect to households and their inclusion in that asset
class?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, you know, that’s, that’s kind of a—it’s not really our, our
bailiwick.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they
have, and that’s why we have, you know, the securities law, laws that we have.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s why, you
know, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want
households to have the chance to understand the risk that they’re taking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I, I do
think it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think
that, that’s something Congress was working on quite a lot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve actually spent a lot of time,
you know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on various things, and I, I
think that would be a very constructive thing for, for Congress to do.</div>
