Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
February 1, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon, and welcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">My colleagues and I understand the
hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back
down to our 2 percent goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the
stance of monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid
tightening so far are yet to be felt.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Even so, we have more work to do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Without price
stability, the economy does not work for anyone.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In particular, without price stability, we will
not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We continue to
anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary
policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, we are
continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price
stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will have more to
say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 1 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this
quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace, in part reflecting tighter
financial conditions over the past year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken,
largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Higher interest rates and slower output growth also
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the
unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 1 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month
over the last three months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past
year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be
out of balance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers, and the
labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the 12 months
ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The inflation data received over the past three
months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, while recent
developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that
inflation is on a sustained downward path.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as
well as measures from financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s not grounds for complacency.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Although
inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The longer the current bout of high
inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become
entrenched.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 2 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4¾ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we are continuing the
process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4½ percentage points over the past
year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds
rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently
restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive
sectors of the economy, particularly housing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It will take time, however, for the full effects of
monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of the cumulative tightening of
monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step-down
from last year’s rapid pace of increases.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the
Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals as we determine the extent of
future increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue
to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and
their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better
alignment with supply.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to
our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Reducing
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum
Page 3 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
employment and stable prices over the longer run.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The historical record cautions strongly
against prematurely loosening policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will stay the course, until the job is done.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses
across the country.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the Fed will do
everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you,
and I look forward to your questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you for
doing this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields
falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in
January.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that make your job of combating inflation harder?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And could you see lifting rates
higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial
conditions?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect
the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say
that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance,
which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, many things
affect financial conditions—not just our policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we will take into account overall financial
conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.</span></p>

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel
from the Washington Post.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Over the last quarter, we’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages,
and a fall in consumer spending, all while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a
historic low.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would
need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you’re looking for?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have
seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would also say that that
disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">What you see is,
really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been
fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you see that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
the other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while
but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be
lower.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The issue is that we have a large sector
called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But I
would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Has your—I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go
changed since December?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting,
and we’ll see at that time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now
Page 5 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
getting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but, you know, we’ll
update those forecasts in March.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin with Axios.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You and some of your
colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would
let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We saw the opposite in the
December JOLTS this morning.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Job openings are actually rising.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That also coincided with
slowdown in wage inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be
studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right about the data, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What we did see—we’ve
seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of
their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The job
openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, I did see that it moved
up—back up this morning.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I do think that it’s probably an important indicator.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The ratio, I
guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you
look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, quits are still at an elevated level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job
market is still very strong.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby, and then Howard.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given the
economic data since the December meeting, is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most
Page 6 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
recent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or does ongoing now mean more
than two rate rises now?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the December meeting, we all wrote down our
best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in
December.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the March meeting,
we’re going to update those assessments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We did not update them today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We did, however,
continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently
restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think we’ve covered a
lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say we still think
there’s work to do there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, you
know, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March
meeting and then the May meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If we come to the view that we
need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would
certainly do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you
know, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of
risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or
going beyond that level?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess I would say it this way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I continue to think that it’s very
difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually
were close but didn’t get the job done.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is a
Page 7 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
very difficult risk to manage, whereas I—of course, we have no incentive and no desire to
overtighten.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But we, you know, if we feel like we’ve gone too far, we can certainly—and
inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I
do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know,
the job is not fully done.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents
56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we don’t see it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not happening yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation in the core services ex.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">housing is still running at 4 percent on a
6- and 12-month basis.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s not—nothing happening there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the other two sectors
representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is
credible, that’s coming together, although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing
services, but it’s in the pipeline, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I
think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that
we’ve really got this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And how
do we get that done?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they
should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, so far, we don’t see that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work
left to do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The statement made a number of changes that
seem to be saying things are getting better.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re saying inflation has eased That’s new.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve taken out references to the war in Ukraine that’s causing price increases.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve taken
out references to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were
Page 8 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
being driven higher, yet that’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We still
have ongoing increases to come.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m wondering, why is that the case?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And does it have
more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a
very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I would say it this way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can now say, I think, for the
first time that the disinflationary process has started.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can see that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we see it, really, in
goods prices so far.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Goods prices is a big sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—this is what we thought would happen
since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards
services.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is a good thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is a good thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s, you know, around a quarter of
the PCE price index—core PCE price index.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the second sector is housing services, and that’s
driven by very different things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and
other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but
will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be
soft.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we do assume that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we actually see
disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little
less than half.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is good.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this
is good.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core
goods ex.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">housing—sorry, the core services ex.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">housing sector that I talked about.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t see
it yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the
same.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different
subsections.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research
would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be
Page 9 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
important.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some of the other ones it’s—the labor market is not going to be important.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many
other factors will drive it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In any case, we don’t see disinflation in that sector yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think
we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the
best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re just telling you that
we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we will fairly soon, but we
don’t see it yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest
with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more
persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re just going to
have to—we have to complete the job.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, that’s what we’re here for.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Chair Powell, you observed
several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above-target
inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high
level despite a historically low unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Given that, and given how much you did
over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why not stop here and
see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and
we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately
restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And why do we think that’s probably necessary?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We think, because inflation is still
running very hot.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re
thinking about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way
we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
Page 10 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
again, we don’t see it affecting the services sector ex.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">housing yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, I mean, I think our
assessment is that we’re not very far from that level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know that, though.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t
know that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by—
you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think policy is
restrictive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re
going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of
the disinflationary process.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this
meeting this week?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three
weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the
path ahead and the state of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all
the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the
path forward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Victoria.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">VICTORIA GUIDA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given
that we’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U.S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do
whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its
own analysis of any legal constraints?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So your question is, would we—say your question again.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 11 of 23

VICTORIA GUIDA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making
payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in
effect, is what—
VICTORIA GUIDA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I feel like I have to say this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s only one way
forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States
government can pay all of its obligations when due.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And any deviations from that path would be
highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the
consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m just
going to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the
event that that would happen?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m just going to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This is a matter that’s to be
resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I gather there
are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not involved in those discussions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re the fiscal agent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna and then Steve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases
and then restarting them?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Lorie Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to
Page 12 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
suggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I wonder if that view is broadly
shared on the Committee.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases
in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive
monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s the judgment that we
made.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know,
we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry, I should have been clearer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, would it be possible to
take a meeting off, for example, and then resume?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, could you, rather than just doing
at every meeting that move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking
about or exploring in any kind of detail.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In principle, though, you know, we used to—the thing
we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was
considered a fast pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think a lot of options are available.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I mean, you saw what the
Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding
right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE
inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent,
and you’ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have
Page 13 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
penciled in for this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And you’ve also achieved it without the 1 percentage point increase in
the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m wondering if you’ve
considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong,
and it’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge
in unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair
Lael Brainard, who said, “To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part
for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
other words, it may not be wages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get
this sector of inflation under control.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So a couple of things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you
take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low
right now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from
goods inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be
transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of
something around zero, something like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go
back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s really where the
sustainable level is.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s more like at 4 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that would suggest there’s work left to do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We would take that into
account.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a
very diverse sector, six or seven sectors.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that—
Page 14 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
subsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the
labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, for example, you know,
financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s why
I said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, clearly, labor is
important for restaurants but so are food prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, transportation services is going
to be driven by fuel prices, for example.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive
inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you
know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the
labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your
question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can
soften.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down
without the softening in the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think most forecasters would say that unemployment
will probably rise a bit from here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to
getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a
significant increase in unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is
quite different.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very
strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior—
you know, in prior business cycles.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the
reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think
will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But I think there is—
there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll have
to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can we get there with 5 percent?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 15 of 23

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Certainly possible.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Absolutely it’s possible.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it’s a
question—no one really knows.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s because this is not like the other business cycles in
so many ways.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It may well be that as—yeah, as—that it will take more slowing than we
expect—than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I don’t—that’s not my base case.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">My base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant
downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that’s a possible outcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think
many, many forecasters would say it’s not the most likely outcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would say there’s a
chance of it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’d like to pick
up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of
your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there’s still a lot of talk
about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the recession indicators are all
suggesting that we are going to see recession this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I’m wondering if you’ve changed
your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is
going forward and whether you’re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which
calls for more restraint on your part.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own
assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a
subdued pace as it did last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also
final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, you know,
most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly
subdued level this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are other factors, though, that need to be considered.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You will
Page 16 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The
labor market remains very, very strong, and that’s job creation, that’s wages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As inflation does
come down, sentiment will improve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You also—state and local governments are really flush
these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending
checks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a lot of spending
coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that’s going to support
economic activity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive
growth this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Okay, Rich.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RICH MILLER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rich Miller from Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First off, how are you
doing?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said
you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you give us some
idea of what you’re thinking of?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You mentioned three months—that we’ve seen three months in
a row.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Governor Waller suggested he might want to see six months.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so is it just the
inflation data, or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have
that “substantially more evidence” metric?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped
or anything like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, of
course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment
reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll
be asking ourselves, what are they telling us?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage

report, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it’s
very complete.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some—was
constructive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re
still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t
want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s
going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy
over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and
achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not—market
participants have a very different job.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a fine job.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a great job.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In fact, I did that job for
years but in one form or another.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we have to deliver that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we are
strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that
will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Michelle.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking
the questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you’ve talked about we had solid job growth.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business, by the way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer
spending.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It seems so far it’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to—from a
9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is the hard part yet to come to go from
6.5 to 2?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t think we know, honestly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, the—so we, of course,
expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all
through ’22.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say these
are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a
Page 18 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what
we did.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just—it’s unique.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think certainty is just not appropriate here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation—it’s
just harder to forecast inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may come down faster.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may take longer to come down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think
we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think
that the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just—it’s the
early stages of disinflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in
disinflation, but that’s great.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that
it’s going to take some time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Do you—how long do you see then, the federal funds rate
remaining at this elevated level?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you
will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a
forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down
steadily but not quickly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those
expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Of
course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different
thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be
seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SIMON RABINOVITCH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">May I ask a further question about the language around “ongoing increases?”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That,
of course, implies at least two further rate rises.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the
Page 19 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
implication is that you’ll raise rates one more time and then pause.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you concerned about that
divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is
largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think
that’s the bigger part of that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts—
different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued
subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we
have inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower
than that this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Markets are past that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll just have to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different
forecast, really.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if
our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If we do see inflation coming down much more
quickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Scott.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SCOTT HORSLEY.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Scott Horsley from NPR.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One of the changes in
the statement this month is that the Committee is no longer listing public health as among the
data points you’ll consider in assessing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What should we make of that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does the
Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the general sense of it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look, we understand—I personally
understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in
our economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think
we just—we knew we would take it out at some point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s never a perfect time, but we
Page 20 of 23

February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
thought that—you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are
handling it better now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It doesn’t really need to be in a—you know, in the Fed’s monthly, you
know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health
issue.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said
recently.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">She said she doesn’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I’m wondering if you agree
with that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, I do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You don’t see that yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the whole point is, you
know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That means that, effectively, in
people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And once that happens—
that’s what we can’t allow to happen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer
we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know,
the more risk of something like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It always
has been more of a risk than anything else.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I’ve seen some data, too, that
show people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">People
really don’t like inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to
economic activity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with
3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical
standards.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why can that be?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It has to be inflation, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I think once inflation is seen to be
coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.</span></p>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So that’s what you’re looking at most closely, is
consumer expectations?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know,
are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of
the process of creating inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a sort of bedrock belief.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In one way or another, it has to
be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think it’s important.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so,
longer-term inflation expectations had moved up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We moved quite vigorously last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Expectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer
end.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think, you know, the
markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to
2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That&#39;s immeasurably helpful to the
process of getting inflation down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The fact that people now do generally believe that it will
come down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s a very positive thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GREG ROBB.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the
minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as
important, when the Committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of
financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
haven’t seen—heard you talk much about that today or in the statement.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I was wondering,
has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you’re concerned about?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would put it this way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s something that we monitor carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Financial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They

mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s important
that the markets do reflect the tightening that we’re putting in place.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As we’ve discussed a
couple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast
inflation will come down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re just going to have to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I’m not going to try to
persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and
some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we’ll see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Brendan, for the last question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">BRENDAN PEDERSEN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative
tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster
to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop-dead
deadline this summer?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible
ramifications.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any
important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as
it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the
progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I believe that
that will happen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I believe it will happen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we, of course, will monitor money market
conditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For example, the Treasury General
Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we understand there’ll be lots of
flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand all that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re
watching it carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll just be monitoring it.</span></p>
