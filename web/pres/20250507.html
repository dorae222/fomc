Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
May 7, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-
run objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to
have risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to
respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. [</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Cough] Pardon me.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were likely driven by businesses bringing in
imports ahead of potential tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This unusual swing complicated GDP measurement last
quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the first quarter, the
same as last year’s pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated while
investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated
uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It remains to
be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 1 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Payroll job gains averaged
155,000 per month over the past three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains
low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Wage growth has continued to moderate,
while still outpacing inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the
labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor
market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat
elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the
12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices
rose 2.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, as reflected in
both market- and survey-based measures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Survey respondents, including consumers, businesses,
and professional forecasters, point to tariffs as the driving factor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Beyond the next year or so,
however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent
inflation goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in
four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The tariff increases
announced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All of these policies are still
evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As economic
conditions evolve, we’ll continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based
on the incoming data, the outlook, and the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Page 2 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to
generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The effects on inflation could be short lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It is
also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Avoiding that
outcome will depend on the size of the tariffs’ effect—tariff effects, on how long it takes for
them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation
expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent
a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As we act to
meet that obligation, we’ll balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are
in tension.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For the time being, we’re well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any
adjustments to our policy stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review
of our monetary policy framework.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We focused on inflation dynamics and the implications for
our monetary policy strategy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference next
week.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Throughout this process, we’re open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take
on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We intend to wrap up the
review by late summer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 3 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in
service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chair, for taking my
question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A lot has happened since the last meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There have been tariffs put on, tariffs taken
off, and meanwhile, there was a bill advancing in Congress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I just wonder if I could press
you on the last part of your statement.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you any closer now to deciding which side of the
mandate is going to need urgent care first?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, so, as we noted in our—in our statement—postmeeting
statement, we’ve judged that the risks to higher employment and higher inflation have both risen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And this, by the way, of course, is compared to March.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what we can say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think
we can say, you know, which way this will shake out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty
about, for example, where tariff policies are going to, to settle out and also, when they do settle
out, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s
too early to know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, I mean, ultimately, we think our policy rate is in—is in a good place
to stay as we await further clarity on tariffs and, ultimately, their implications for the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hearing you describe what you’re looking for in terms of being able
to make a decision, it sounded like that’s a long-term process before you sound like you’re going
to be comfortable, or the Committee would be comfortable, to act on what the data’s telling you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t think we know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I think—look where we are
today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We have an economy that, if you “look through,” you know, the sort of distortions in Q1
GDP, you’ve still got an economy that looks like it’s growing at a solid pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market
appears to be solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation is running just a bit above 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s an economy that’s
been resilient and is in good shape, and our policy is sort of modestly or moderately restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was last fall.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we think that leaves us in a good
place to wait and see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t think we need to be in a hurry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think we can be patient.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to be watching the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The data may move quickly or slowly, but we do think
we’re in a good position, where we are, to, to let things evolve and become clearer in terms of
what should be the monetary policy response.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos for the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, there’s
naturally a lot of [inaudible] around 2021 in supply shocks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But there are some who argue that
the current situation has notable differences.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Energy costs are down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Housing imbalances look
nothing like they did four years ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Labor demand appears to be gradually cooling, with wage
growth running below 4 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What do you see right now that could nourish higher inflation
beyond a rise in goods prices this year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think the underlying inflation picture is, is good.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s what you see,
which is inflation now running a bit above 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ve had basically decent readings
in housing services and nonhousing services, which is a big part of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that part, I think is, is
moving along well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But there’s just so much that we don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think—and we’re in a good position to
wait and see, is the thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t have to be in a hurry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The economy is—has been resilient
and is doing fairly well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our policy is well positioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The costs of waiting to see further are
fairly low, we think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s what we’re doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’ll, we’ll see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
Administration is entering into negotiations with many countries over tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll know more
with each week and month that goes by where—about where tariffs are going to land—you
know, land, and we’ll know what the effects will be when we start to see those things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we
think we’ll be learning.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I can’t tell you how long it will take.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, for now, it does seem like
it’s, it’s, it’s a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see and watch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So when you say that you don’t need to be in a hurry, does that mean
that—could the outlook change in such a way that a change in your stance could be warranted as
soon as your next meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, as I said, we’re—we are comfortable with our policy
stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think the right—we’re in the right place to wait and see how things evolve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
don’t feel like we need to be in a hurry.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We feel like it’s appropriate to be patient.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you
know, when things develop—of course, we have a record of—we can move quickly when that’s
appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we think right now, the appropriate thing to do is to wait and see how things
evolve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s so much uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you talk to businesses or market participants or
forecasters, everyone is just—is just waiting to see how developments play out, and then we’ll be
able to make a better assessment of what the appropriate path for monetary policy is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re
not in that place, and, you know, as that develops—and I can’t really give you a time frame
on that.</div>

JONNELLE MARTE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, many economists have been
pricing in higher odds of a recession, and several are noting that it is more difficult for the Fed to
cut rates preemptively, given the higher risks for higher inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, given the outlook, do you
still see a path for a soft landing, and what does that look like?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, let me say—I mean, so let’s, let’s, let’s look back and see
where we are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, go through 2024 up to the [present] day.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ve had—we’ve had, you know,
unemployment in the low 4s for more than a year, we’ve had inflation coming down in the—now
in the mid-to-low 2s, and we’ve had an economy growing at 2½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that is—that is the
economy as we see it now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we
will see the—certainly, the risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
if that’s what we do see, if—and if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we
don’t know, then, then we will see—we won’t see further progress toward our goals, but we
might see a delay in that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think in the—you know, in our thinking, we would get—we would
never—we never do anything but keep achieving those goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what we would—at least for
the next, let’s say, year, we would—we would not be making progress toward those goals, again,
if that is—if that’s the way the tariffs shake out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The thing is, we don’t know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s so
much uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of the tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
terms of preemption, you know, I think you can look back at the 2019 cuts as preemptive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
wouldn’t say that what we did last fall was at all preemptive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If anything, it was a little late.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
2019, we did cut three times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the situation was, you had a weakening economy, and you had
inflation at 1.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s a situation where you can move preemptively.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Now we have
inflation running above target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It has been above target for four years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not so far above
target now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And we have an expectation conditional on what happens that we’ll see upward
pressure on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you look at where forecasters are, they’re all forecasting an increase in
Page 7 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it makes it—and then we’ve also got, you know, forecasts of weakening in the
economy, and some have recession forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t make a—we don’t make—publish a
forecast about, about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t publish a forecast that assesses how likely a recession is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, in any case, it’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don’t
know what the right response to, to the data will be until we see more data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>How much weakness does the
Committee need to see, though, in the labor market and the economy more broadly to lower
interest rates again?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Is it about a certain increase in the unemployment rate over a period of
time, or perhaps a certain number of negative monthly job reports?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, how are you making
that assessment?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, so first of all, we don’t see that yet, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have
4.2 percent unemployment, good participation, wages behaving very well, participation, I
mentioned, at a good level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, with the labor market, we would look at the totality of
the—of the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’d look at the level of the unemployment rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’d look at the speed with
which it’s changing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We would look at the whole huge array of labor market data to, to get a
sense of whether conditions are really deteriorating or not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, at the same time, we’d be
looking at the other side of the mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We could be in a position of having to balance those
two things, which is, of course, a very—a difficult balancing judgment that we’d have to make.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On that point about balancing, I mean, you’ve mentioned that the
Committee would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the time it would take to
kind of get back to that point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what does that mean in practice?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, how much of that
assessment will be rooted in a forecast, versus data dependence?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 8 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would be a combination of the two.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, let’s just say this is
a—this would be a complicated and challenging judgment that we would have to make if—and
this is—we’re not in this situation, but the situation is if the two goals are in tension.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So let’s say
that unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way and so is inflation—not the situation
we’re in—hypothetically.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they’re
expected to be from the goals, what’s the expected time to get back to their goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’d look at
all those things and make a difficult judgment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s in our framework.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s always been in
our thinking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s—we haven’t had—we haven’t faced that question in a very long
time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, again, difficult, difficult judgment to make, and not one that we face today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
we may never face it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, we have to be keeping it in our thinking now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we had
the CPI report that came out that showed, month over month, the first increase in inflation in
about three years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The jobs report—you said “solid”—that we saw.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time, we have
those new tariffs that we’re living under.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, given this, should the Federal Reserve be cutting
rates at all this year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s going to depend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think you have to just take a step
back and realize this is—this is why we are where we are, is, you know, we are going to need to
see how this evolves.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this
year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are cases in which it wouldn’t, and we just don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Until we know more about
how this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment, for—and
for, for inflation, I couldn’t confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, following on that, just, you know—so then how does
President Trump calling on you personally as well as the Federal Reserve to make rate cuts affect
your decision today and affect your job difficulty?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>[0:18:00]
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Doesn’t affect our—doing our job at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we—you know, we’re
always going to do the same thing—which is, we’re going to use our tools to foster maximum
employment and price stability for the benefit of the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re always going to
consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s it, that’s all we’re
going to consider.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering—I mean, given the complexity about the first-quarter GDP and what lies ahead,
I’m just wondering what your intuition tells you about the underlying direction of the economy
right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many of your colleagues have said they feel growth is slowing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If so, do you have
any sense of by how much, to what degree the slowdown may be?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What does your gut tell you
about how things are evolving out there?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is
extremely elevated [laughter] and that the downside risks have increased.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The risk is—as we
pointed out in our statement, the risks—the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation
have risen, but they haven’t materialized yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They really haven’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re not, really not in the
data yet, so that—and that tells me more than by intuition because I think—I think it’s obvious,
actually, that the right thing for us to do is to—we’re in a good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our policy’s in a very
good place, and the right thing to do is, is await further clarity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I—you know, there’s—
usually, things clarify, and that—the appropriate direction becomes clear.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what usually
Page 10 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Right now, it’s very hard to say what that would be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the meantime, the
economy is doing fine.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our policy isn’t—you know, it’s not highly restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s somewhat
restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was in, you know, last summer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we
think it’s—we think it’s in a good place, and we think the appropriate thing is for us to wait and
see and get more clarity about, about the direction of the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, let me press you on this idea of the economy being fine
right now, because, reading the Beige Book very closely the last time around, there was a lot of,
you know, negative stuff, negative sentiment that was in there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I know that everybody’s
looking at soft data right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned it yourself—that the sentiment’s sour.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the
Beige Book was talking about, you know, the beginnings of layoffs in some industries, prices
rising in, in some places, and an awful lot of investment decisions being, being pushed to the
sideline.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Doesn’t that point to a slowdown?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It may well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It just hasn’t shown up yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, we all
look at all these sentiments and read many, many individual comments just to get a better feel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it—you know, businesses and households very broadly are concerned and, you know,
postponing economic decisions of various kinds.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, yes, if that continues and nothing,
nothing happens to sort of alleviate those concerns, then you would expect that to begin to show
up in economic data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It wouldn’t maybe show up overnight, but it would show up over weeks
and months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that may be what happens, but it hasn’t happened yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And also, there are
things that can happen that will—that will change that narrative.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, they haven’t happened,
but it’s possible to imagine things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in the meantime, yes, we’re watching it extremely
carefully, like everyone is, but don’t see really much evidence of it in the actual economic data
yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And by the way, consumers keep spending, credit card spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—you know, it’s
Page 11 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
still—it’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment
on the part of people and businesses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
Fed’s been criticized recently by a former Governor for what he calls “mission creep”—you take
on more problems, use more tools, and then end up building tools to deal with the fallout of those
tools, which then makes it a given that you will act more aggressively in the future.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that a fair
critique, and is that something you would be looking at in your framework review?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, say that critique again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That the Fed has been involved in mission creep—gets involved in
using too many new tools to deal with problems and to go too far.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that something that—the
critique was based around the fact that you did QE and QE and QE and—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Oh, okay.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE. —</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>and went beyond the narrow confines of your mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—well, I mean, there are a couple—that’s not really beyond the
confines of our mandate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—look, I would say this: We—you know, we did things—essentially,
we were on an emergency footing for a couple of years in the pandemic, and it’s very fair and
very welcome for people to look back over what we did and say, “Hey, you could have done this
better and different.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And one thing we hear a lot is, we could have explained the QE a little
better.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We did think we were explaining it in real time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I completely accept the, the thought that
we could have explained it better.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a lot of thinking that we went on too long with QE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
can tell you that the reason we did was, we were—we were concerned that we didn’t want a
tightening of—a sharp tightening in financial conditions at a time when we thought the economy
Page 12 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
was still vulnerable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so we did hold on for a long time to QE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we, of course, tapered
and everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then we immediately went into QT, and, you know, we’ve—we’re down a
couple of trillion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I get the—that, you know, we, we certainly, with the benefit of hindsight,
could have tapered earlier or faster.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s absolutely right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But this is all very welcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
know, it’s, it’s—you know, we knew, doing this in real time, that we weren’t going to get it
perfect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And those kind of—those kind of, you know, after-action kind of looks are essential.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re doing the same thing in—you know, in our review, so—on some issues.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There—the other part of that critique is that you’ve taken on topics
that are outside of the mandate, such as climate change and trying to ensure that certain groups
are benefited by your economic policies in terms of employment, et cetera.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, okay, on climate, you’ve heard me say over and over again that
we will not be climate policymakers and that our role on climate is a very, very narrow one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
I think—I think that’s what we’ve done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve done really very little on climate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can say
that was—that little bit that we’ve done was too much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I wouldn’t want to give any
impression that, that, you know, we take—that we’ve taken climate in and it’s something that
we’re spending a lot of time and energy on.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have very, very narrow things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
did one thing, one guidance for the banks, and then we did one—a one-time stress analysis,
climate stress analysis, and that’s it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we dropped out of the Network for
Greening the Financial System.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we didn’t do much on climate, but—and I do think, and I’ve
said this publicly several times, I think it’s, it’s a real danger for us to try to take on a mandate
like that, which is very narrow application to our work.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, the risk is, if you—if
you go for things that are really not on your mandate, you know, then why are you independent?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I think that’s a very fair question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I do think we’ve done a whole lot less on
climate than some people seem to think we did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Anyway, that’s what I think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 13 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Should you have taken on the question of bringing unemployment
rates down for specific categories?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We didn’t do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, we said—what we said was that we
never targeted any unemployment rate for individual racial or demographic groups.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What we
said was that maximum employment was a broad and inclusive goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I think what we meant
by that was, we’re going to consider the totality of the country as we look at our maximum-
employment goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, we were never going to target on any individual group with that,
but I think some people, you know, wanted to hear it that way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s not at all what we
meant.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—so that’s just not a correct reading of our—but I can see how, you know, maybe
people found that confusing, and, you know, we have to take that into consideration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jo Ling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JO LING KENT.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m Jo Ling
Kent with CBS News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve said, “Wait and see” and “The economy is doing fine” today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the impact of tariffs are already showing up at the ports.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Businesses big and small are telling
us that they feel it, and most importantly, consumers say they feel it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the challenges are here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And there’s no waiting and seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For Main Street, what is the breaking point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What would
have to happen to prompt a rate cut specifically?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, you know, so we really don’t see in the data yet big economic
effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We see—we see sentiment, their concerns that higher prices may be coming, or things
like that, but—so people, they’re worried now about inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re worried about, you
know, a shock from the tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But they really haven’t—that shock hasn’t hit yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Okay, so, you
know, we’re going to be looking at not just the sentiment data, but also the real economic data as
we assess what it is we should do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And remember, we’re—there will be two effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One of
them would be weakening economy—weakening economic activity, which translates into higher
Page 14 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployment, and the other would be potentially higher inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, to say it again, the
timing, the scope, the scale, and the persistence of those effects are very, very uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s
not at all clear what the appropriate response for monetary policy is at this time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re—
you know—and by the way, our policy’s in a good place, so we think we can wait and move
when it is clear what the right thing to do is; really not at all clear what it is we should do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So
people are feeling stress and concern, but unemployment hasn’t gone up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job creation is fine.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Wages are in good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, people are not—layoffs are—people are not getting laid
off at high levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, initial claims for unemployment are not increasing, you know, in
any kind of impressive way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the economy itself is still, you know, in solid shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just a quick follow-up: President Trump now says he does not plan to
remove you as Chair.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When you heard that, what did you think?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t have anything more for you on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve pretty much
covered that issue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I
just wanted to follow up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Earlier, it sounded like you said it was unclear how the Fed—you
know, what kind of interest rate decisions you will make later this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So does that—you
know, in March, there was guidance that two cuts might happen, you know, two cuts were
penciled in for this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that now—that guidance from the last press conference, has that
been overtaken by events at this point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we don’t do a Summary of Economic Projections at
every meeting, as you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do it every other meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so this was the meeting when
we didn’t do it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I—you know, we don’t also kind of poll people, so I really—I really
wouldn’t want to try to make a specific projection for where we are relative to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will—in
Page 15 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
six weeks, we have the June meeting, and you’ll have another SEP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not going to hazard a
guess here today what—as to what it would be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, what I would say is that we think our
policy rate is in a good place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think it leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to
potential developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s where we are, and that—depending on the way things play out,
that could include rate hikes—sorry, rate cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it could include us holding where we
are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just are going to need to see, you know, how things play out before we make those
decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Great.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to follow up on that, I mean, when you
address the issue of how the Fed would handle both rising unemployment and rising inflation,
how are you thinking about the fact that addressing one could exacerbate the other?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So a rate cut
to reduce unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How does that—how do you
handle those challenges?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, you just captured the—this is the issue with the two goals
being in tension.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a very challenging question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now, there can be a case in which one goal is
very far—one variable’s very far from its goal, much farther than the other.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if so, you
concentrate on that one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, frankly, that was the case—well, it wasn’t a case where they were
really in tension.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But if you go back to 2022, it was very clear that we needed to focus on
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market was also super tight, so it wasn’t really a tradeoff.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, if—I
think you know what our—what our framework document says.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It says we’ll look at how far
each goal—each variable is from its goal and also we’ll factor in the time it would take to get
there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, that’s going to be a—potentially, a very difficult judgment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the data
could break in a way that it’s not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I just don’t think we know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The data could
easily favor one or the other.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And right now, there’s no way to—no need to make a choice and
no real basis for doing so.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask, Congress is
currently debating spending cuts alongside expending—extending the tax cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I know
you’ve talked many times about how the path of the debt is unsustainable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But given that we’re
also talking right now about the economy slowing, potentially even recession, I was just
wondering, is there a danger that spending cuts now could slow growth a lot more?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we don’t give Congress fiscal advice.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I—they’re going
to do—we take what they do as a given, and we put it in our models and in our assessment of the
economy, so I wouldn’t want to, you know, speculate on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, I think we do know that
the debt is on an unsustainable level—on an unsustainable path—not on an unsustainable level,
but an unsustainable path.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s on Congress to figure out how to get us back on a sustainable
path, and, you know, it’s not up to us to give them advice.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, do you think that they should take macroeconomic
conditions into account as they look at this?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think they don’t need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal
policy any more than we need their advice on monetary policy. [</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>ANDREW ACKERMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Andrew Ackerman with the
Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In your Jackson Hole comments last year, you said you would not welcome
further cooling in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate then was 4.2 percent, which
is what it is now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Forecasters—many forecasters now predict a higher jobless rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>How has
your tolerance for weakening labor market conditions changed compared to a year ago?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it was quite a different situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What was happening last year is
that over the space of six, eight, seven months, the unemployment rate went up by almost a full
Page 17 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know,
everywhere, people were talking about downside risks to the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the same time,
payroll job numbers were getting softer and softer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So there was a really obvious concern about
downside risk to the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so at Jackson Hole and then in September, you know, we
wanted to address that forthrightly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We wanted to show that we were there for the—I mean, we
had been there for inflation for a couple of years, and we wanted to show also that we’re there
for the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it was important that we send that signal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Fortunately, since then, the
labor market has really—and the unemployment rate have really been moving sideways at a level
that is, you know, well in the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that
concern has gotten a lot less.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, you know, you’re at 4.2 percent unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we
were in a very different situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And now we have a situation where, you know, the risks to
higher inflation and higher unemployment have both gone up, as we noted in our statement, and
we’ve got to monitor both of those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We actually have a potential situation where there may be a
tradeoff or tension between the two potentially.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t have it yet, and we may not have it,
but that’s what we [may] have, and that’s why I think it’s a very different, different situation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I mean, I guess I want to follow up by asking how much of
a rise in the jobless rate you would—you could tolerate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I can’t give you a—you know, a—I’m not going to try to give you a
specific number.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I’ll just say, we’ve got—we have to now be looking at both variables and
which of them is, is, you know, demanding—if one of them is demanding our focus more than
the other, that would tell us what to do with policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If they’re more or less this, you know,
equally distant and equally—or not distant, then we don’t have to make that assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
know, the assessment is, you wait.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m not going to try to be really specific about what we
need to see in terms of the number.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if—look, if we did see, you know, significant
Page 18 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
deterioration in the labor market, of course that’s one of our two variables, and we would look to
be able to support that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’d hope that it wasn’t also coming at a time when inflation was
getting very bad.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, we’re speculating here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know any
of these things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s very hypothetical.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re just going to have to wait and see how the—how it
plays out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CLAIRE JONES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Claire Jones, Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of getting some clarity, we’ve
got some talks at the weekend in Geneva between the U.S. and China.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A lot of economists are
ask—are attaching an awful lot of importance to how—what we hear from those talks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How
much importance are you attaching to them in terms of judging what will happen to the U.S.
economy going forward?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just in a similar vein, you know, some economists are saying it’s
days, not weeks, that we have until we start to put the U.S. economy at risk of seeing a sort of
pandemic here, with shortages and higher prices, if we don’t kind of soothe relations between the
U.S. and China.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it would be good to have your view on that, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, these are not talks that we’re in any way involved in,
so I really can’t comment directly on them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but what I will say is this: You know, we
had—coming out of the March meeting, we, we—the public generally had an assessment of
where tariffs were going.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then April 2 happened, and it was really substantially larger than
anticipated in the forecasts that I’ve seen and in our forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—and now we—and now we
have a different—we’re in a new phase where—it seems to be we’re entering a new phase where
the Administration is entering into beginning talks with a number of our important trading
partners.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—that has the potential to change the picture materially or not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I
think it’s going to be very important how that shakes out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I—you know, we simply have to
Page 19 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
wait and see how it works out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It certainly could change the picture, and we’re mindful of not
trying to make conclusive judgments about what will happen at a time when the—you know,
when the facts are changing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And just on the fall in shipping volumes from China over these
tensions, I mean, do you share that concern that we could start seeing goods shortages and higher
prices in the coming weeks if this isn’t resolved very quickly?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I don’t want to get my—we’re not—we shouldn’t be
involved, even verbally, in questions about the timing of these things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yes, we’re—of course,
we follow all that data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see the shipping data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see all that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, ultimately, this is for the
Administration to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is—you know, this is their mandate, not ours.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I know they’re—
as you can see, they’re, again, having—beginning to have talks with many nations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that has
the potential to change the picture materially, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for doing this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The
volume of imported goods increased significantly in the first quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Do you think the decision
could cause a delay in the impact of tariff on inflation, and does this mean that it will take a
longer time to reduce uncertainty?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The decision we made today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Which decision?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the future decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the volume of imports—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KOSUKE TAKAMI. —</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>imported goods has increased significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the impact of the
imported inflation may delay.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, what is the impact to your future decision?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, so, I mean, I think we—I think we think that the—you know,
there was a big spike in imports—right?—very big, historically large, really, and—to beat tariffs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 20 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And now that should actually reverse so that it’s—you know, it’s the difference between—it’s
exports minus imports, so—and imports were huge, and so then it conveyed a very negative
contribution to U.S. GDP—annualized GDP in the first quarter, as we all know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that could, in
the second quarter, be reversed so that we have, you know, an unusually large contribution to—
unusually positive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That’s very likely as imports drop sharply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You could also have—you know,
very likely you’ll have restatements of the—of the first quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’ll turn out that consumer
spending was higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It will turn out that inventories were higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so you’ll see—you’ll see
those data revised up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It may actually go into the third quarter, too.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I think it’s going—
this whole process is going to, a little bit, make it harder to make a clean assessment of U.S.
demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mentioned private domestic final purchases, which doesn’t have inventories,
government, or—inventories, government.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Anyway, it’s a cleaner read on private demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But
that, that, too, probably was flattered a little bit by—you know, by strong demand for imports to
be tariffed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that might overstate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a really good reading, 3 percent PDFP in the first
quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That might actually overstate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s not really going to—I don’t think it’s going to
affect our decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will just say, though, that it’s a little confusing and it’s probably less
confusing to us than it would be to the general public as we try to explain this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, it’s
complicated, and, you know, GDP is sending a signal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>PDFP is sending a signal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a little bit
confusing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think we understand what’s going, and it’s not really going to change things
for us.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COURTENAY BROWN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Courtenay Brown from Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I guess, you
know, we talked about some of the indications of potential layoffs, price hikes, an economic
slowdown all being evident in the soft data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m curious why the Fed needs to wait for that to
translate into hard data to, you know, make any type of monetary policy decision, especially if
Page 21 of 25

May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the hard data is not as timely or might be warped by tariff-related effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you worried that
the soft data might be some sort of false warning?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s—look, the—look at the state of the economies.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The
labor market is solid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation is low.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can afford to be patient as things unfold.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s no
real cost to our waiting at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Also, the sense of it—the sense of it is, we’re not sure what
the right thing will be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You know, there should be some increase in inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>There should be
some increase in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those call for different responses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so until we know—
potentially call for different responses—and so, you know, until we know more, we have the
ability to wait and see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it seems to be a pretty clear decision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everyone on the Committee
supported waiting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that’s why we’re waiting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just a very quick follow-up: There was this sort of vibe
session, if you will, where the sentiments expressed in soft data did not translate into the hard
economic data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you—how are you thinking about that when interpreting some of the signs
in the softer survey data?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I think, going back a number of years, the link between
sentiment data and consumer spending has been weak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not been a strong link at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the
other hand, we haven’t had a move of this, you know, speed and size.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it wouldn’t be the case
that we’re looking at this and just completely dismissing it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s another reason to wait and
see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re right that we had a couple of years during the pandemic where people were
saying—just very downbeat surveys and going out and spending money.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that can happen,
and that may happen to some degree here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This is an outsized change in
sentiment, though, and so none of us are looking at this and saying that we’re sure one way or
the other.</div>

MATT EGAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Matt Egan with CNN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you mentioned earlier
that you’re monitoring the shipping data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we have seen in the shipping data that imports
from China into the Port of Los Angeles have plunged.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that has raised concerns about
potential shortages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>What tools, if any, does the Fed have to ensure that prices and inflation
expectations don’t get out of hand if tariffs do cause significant supply chain disruptions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I mean, we don’t have, you know, the kind of tools that are good at
dealing with supply chain problems.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t have that at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s a—that’s a job for the
Administration and for the private sector more than anything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, what we can do with
our interest rate tool is, we can support—be more or less supportive of demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s—
that’d be a very inefficient way to try to fix supply chain problems.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, you know, we don’t
see—we don’t see the inflation yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, of course, reading the same stories and watching the
same data as everybody else.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, right now, we see inflation, you know, kind of
moving sideways at a fairly low level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MATT EGAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up on that, President Trump has indicated that he will
likely name a replacement for you when your term as Chair expires next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But your position
on the Board runs through January 2028, I believe.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you consider remaining on the Fed
Board even if you’re no longer Chair?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I don’t have anything for you on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My whole focus is on—
and my colleagues’ focus is all on, you know, trying to navigate this tricky passage we’re in right
now, trying to make the right decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we want to make the best decisions for the
people that we serve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s what we think about day and night.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And this is a challenging
situation, and that’s, that’s 100 percent of our focus right now.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger
with Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Public records of your schedule so far this year show no meetings with
President Trump.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Past Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have all met with Fed Chairs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
you met with Trump during his first term.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why haven’t you asked for a meeting yet with the
President?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve never asked for a meeting with any President, and I never will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not—I wouldn’t do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting.</div>

been the other way.</div>

opportunity—

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>to get more information?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I never—it’s never an initiative that I take.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s always an
initiative—I—you know, I don’t think it’s up to a Fed Chair to seek a meeting with the
President, although maybe some have done so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve never done so, and I can’t imagine myself
doing that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—I think it’s always—comes the other way: A President wants to meet with you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that hasn’t happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if I could just ask one question on monetary policy,
when it is time to cut rates, how will you determine how far down rates will have to come to try
to keep a balance on the inflation mandate as employment weakens?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I think once you have a direction—a clear direction, you
can make a—we can make a judgment about how fast to move and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s—
really, the harder question is the timing, I think, and when will that become clear?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
fortunately, as I mentioned, we have our policy in a good place, the economy’s in a good place,
Page 24 of 25
