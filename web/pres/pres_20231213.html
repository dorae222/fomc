Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
December 13, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.681)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been
made toward our dual-mandate objectives.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come
without a significant increase in unemployment.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s very good news.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But inflation is still too
high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As
we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Our actions have moved our policy rate well into
restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity
and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce
our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that
we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will make decisions about the extent of any
additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.733)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will have more to say about
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.852)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from
the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Even so, GDP is on track to expand around

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving
supply conditions.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">After picking somewhat over the—up somewhat over the summer, activity in
the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business
fixed investment.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants
revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median
projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate
remains low at 3.7 percent.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the
supply of workers.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly
for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Although
the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available
workers.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing
upward pressures on inflation.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises
somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose
2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and
energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 2 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need
to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our
goal.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a
broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from
financial markets.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation
all the way to 2 percent will take some time.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent
this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our restrictive
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle,
the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing
progress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re committed to achieving a stance of
Page 3 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a path to that
objective.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to
raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.</span> <small>(0.493)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and
2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve
as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is
proceeding carefully.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and
inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In determining the extent of any additional policy
firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will
take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary
policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-
term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage
for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 4 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Chris Rugaber.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wanted
to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “any” before “additional . . .</span> <small>(0.612)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">firming” in
the statement?</span> <small>(0.681)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, does that mean that you’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the
Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the
extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy
firming”—that sentence.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe
that we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Participants didn’t write down
additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down.</span> <small>(0.410)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But participants also
didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s really what we were
thinking.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Fed
Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several
months could be cutting interest rates.</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree
with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn’t cut
rates if inflation fell.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, sir.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, of course, I don’t comment on, on any other officials, even those
who work at the Fed.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the way—
the way we’re looking at it is, is really this.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When we started out, right, we said the first question
is, how fast to move, and we moved very fast.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The second question is, you know, really, how
high to raise the policy rate?</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s really the question that we’re still on here.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re, we’re
very focused on that, as I—as I mentioned.</span> <small>(0.368)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People generally think that we’re at or near that and,
and think it’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’t take that possibility off the table.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s—when you get to that question, and that’s your answer, there’s a natural—naturally, it
begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back
the amount of policy restraint that’s in place.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s really the next question, and that’s what people are thinking about and, and
talking about.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I would just say this.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that
appears to be moderating; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so
many measures; and we’re seeing inflation making real progress.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These are the things we’ve
been wanting to see.</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can’t know.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We still have a ways to go.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No one is declaring victory.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That would be premature.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we can’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing].</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re,
we’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s, that’s really the question that we’re on.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, of course, the other question, the question of
when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place,
that, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion—topic of discussion out in the
world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 6 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it, it comes up in this way today.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everybody wrote down
an SEP forecast.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So many people mentioned what their—what their rate forecast was.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there
was no back-and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like, “This is what I wrote down;
this is what I think,” that kind of thing, and a preliminary kind of a discussion like that.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Not
everybody did that, but many people did.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then, and I would say, there’s a general
expectation that this will be—this will be a topic for us, looking ahead.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that’s really what
happened in today’s meeting.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I can’t do the head count for you in real time.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s generally
what happened today.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Rachel.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a
recession and isn’t heading for one now?</span> <small>(0.678)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if the answer is “no,” I’m curious about what
you’d still be looking for.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the
economy is in a recession now.</span> <small>(0.696)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say that.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next
year, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s always a
real possibility.</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here.</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I have always felt, since the
beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could
cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that
have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles.</span> <small>(0.406)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So far, that’s what we’re
seeing.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing.</span> <small>(0.656)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This result is not

guaranteed.</span> <small>(0.691)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is—it is far too early to declare victory.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there are certainly risks.</span> <small>(0.557)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s
certainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has done that
repeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, where we are is, is we
see the things that I—that I mentioned.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m curious, if you’re looking back on the past year, you talked
about “navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.”</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Can you talk about some of the ways in
which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way
and had to pivot to respond?</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very
broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And not only did that not happen—that
includes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of
forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually
had a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on
the supply side.</span> <small>(0.338)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked
up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages
and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So we had significant supply-side gains with
strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth
year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just
because of the healing on the supply side.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that was a surprise to just about everybody.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but
in a very different setting.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has
also been significantly better.</span> <small>(0.393)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a
Page 8 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
significant increase in, in unemployment.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It didn’t really happen.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re still at 3.7 percent.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So
we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that’s coming back into
balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a—you
know, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for
taking the questions.</span> <small>(0.824)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what—on what
motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’s a coincidence, for example, that the spread
between PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you’re expecting, in
the rate of inflation that you’re expecting as opposed to supporting the economy?</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nothing quite that mechanical is happening.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The SEP really is, is a
bottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right?</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think people are looking at what’s happening
in the economy.</span> <small>(0.757)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is
that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know,
really significantly in three months.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a big piece of, of this.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the same time, [real GDP]
growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter. [</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now it] is slowing, we believe, as,
as appropriate.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again,
significant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re
seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But so I think that
people look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast
and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We tabulate them and, and publish it.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so it’s
not—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it?</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>

HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, that’s—that is—that is something that we’re very
conscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we
think about things.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter.</span> <small>(0.787)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as you well
know, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how
tight policy is at any given time.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you
would get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is
declining as we—as we move forward.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has, has
already kind of begun.</span> <small>(0.634)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m wondering, just related to, to Steve’s question, how the—how the
tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into
2024, the closer you get to a presidential election.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you want to front-load this, in other
words?</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
don’t think about politics.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy.</span> <small>(0.791)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have to think,
what’s the right thing?</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time
we—when we think is the right time.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we’ll always do.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I mentioned we’re moving carefully.</span> <small>(0.352)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One of the things we’re moving carefully about
is that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough,
really.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s us thinking that
we have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to
Page 10 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, it’s not the base case anymore,
obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s how we’re—that’s how we’re
approaching things.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks
about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start
to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having
going forward.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time
goes forward.</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.786)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, you’ve
argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the
market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The market is now easing policy
on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that’s a full point below the
current level, with cuts beginning around March.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is this something that you are broadly
comfortable with?</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw
thing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and
moving back and that kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what
we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really
focus on.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going
to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know.</span> <small>(0.744)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in any case,
we have to do what we think is right.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned
or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course,
Page 11 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
because we will do what it takes to get to our goals.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, ultimately, that will mean that
financial conditions will, will come along.</span> <small>(0.738)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in the meantime, there can be back-and-forth,
and, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And my colleagues are
focused on that, too.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Do
you believe we’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Listen, I welcome the progress.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s, it’s really good to see the
progress that we’re making.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures,
you see very low numbers.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation].</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That isn’t to say—
I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s great.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just need to see more.</span> <small>(0.378)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
need to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s what we need to see.</span> <small>(0.346)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And that—it’s one of our two
jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re very focused on, on, you
know, doing that.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re pleased with the
progress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is
a lot of uncertainty about going forward.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen the economy move in surprising
directions, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If
growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than
Page 12 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates?</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Or, put another way, is below-trend
growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Growth is one thing,
so is inflation, so is labor market data.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’d, we’d look at the totality.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As we—as we make
decisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and,
particularly, about the—as they affect the outlook.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and
the balance of risks as well.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.</span> <small>(0.383)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’ll be good for the
labor market.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to
2 percent.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we
will set policy according to what we actually see.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and so that’s how I would answer.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I guess the—I guess the question I’m asking, if you don’t mind a
quick follow-up, I guess the question I’m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s only a
problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, you know, if you
have—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor
market very strong.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That could
mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That could mean we need to keep rates
higher for longer.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again.</span> <small>(0.391)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It just is—
it’s the way, the way our policy works.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Neil.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin with Axios.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do you interpret the state
of the labor market right now?</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in particular, you’ve referred even today to evidence that
Page 13 of 24

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it’s coming into better balance.</span> <small>(0.730)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that
balance?</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things.</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s—
you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given
population growth and labor force participation.</span> <small>(0.382)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The things that are not quite—but let me go on
with that list.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, claims are low.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re—
sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and
they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at shortages of
workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to
it, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation,

things.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation
over a long period of time.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">They’ve been gradually cooling off.</span> <small>(0.386)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if wages are running around
4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I guess there, there are just a couple of
other—the unemployment rate is very, very low.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And these are—but, but I would just say,
overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>

we—when we hear from the general public, there’s a lot of discord about economic conditions.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may be.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down,
and that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Prices of some, some goods and

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So people are
still living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>

you know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now
positive.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that might help improve the mood of people.</span> <small>(0.666)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys.</span> <small>(0.650)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The thing that we can do is
to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’re not behind the

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
we do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do

when you’re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates—you’re getting now
back to the point where both mandates are important, and they’re, they’re more in balance, too.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You know, we’re, we’re
obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see?</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see the same
thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in
2023.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you see what the forecasts are.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think the median growth—median participant wrote
down 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s very hard to predict.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We’ll also
be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but
ideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be
essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and
error, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really
specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used
in, I guess, 2013.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down.</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s not something—you

whose SEP is right.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So and
it’s, you know, it’s important for people to know that.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it wouldn’t need to be a sign of—it
could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn’t need the tight policy.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
depends on—the economy can evolve in many different ways, right?</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So but, but it could be
more of what I just described.</span> <small>(0.406)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And you focused on core inflation, we’ve heard from—in
other meetings.</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How sticky is core inflation right now?</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve
seen real progress in, in core inflation.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is
thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which
was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are seeing some progress
there, though.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing:
goods, housing services, nonhousing services.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re all contributing in different—at different
levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, yeah.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Catarina.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the

December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Right.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we got—we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we
got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation].</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s
very late in the game, you know, to—but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to
update their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">After that, so staff has to—has to
cumulate all of that and create the documents that you see.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So until about midmorning, a little,
maybe late morning, it’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast
based on what we saw today.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And do you see—I mean, how are you, when you think
about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do
you, you know, how do you think about the economy we’re in now kind of post-pandemic?</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do
you think that there’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look
at a rate cut path?</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question of whether there have been fundamental structural
shifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The one that
would affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate
of interest is.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to
have risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey
the same level of restriction.</span> <small>(0.557)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The thing is, we’re not really going to know that.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s just
that it’s going to be uncertain.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really
unprecedented environment.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the
natural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy
Page 19 of 24

operates with a lag.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year.</span> <small>(0.393)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We started
slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s—
you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it
doesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Maybe people just bought so

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to
2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On a six-
month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and
shelter, they are, of course, stickier.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So when looking in the different components of the data,
how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates
is that policy would be, it would be too late.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the
economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,
if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, it takes—it
takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I can’t give you a precise answer.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have
talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it’s also
been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m curious, do you think something
has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still?</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or is it
something different about the U.S. economy?</span> <small>(0.745)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think—I think this.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we felt since the beginning that it
would be a combination of two factors.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what
happened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And the second thing would
be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the
supply side to recover because of lower demand.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We thought those two things were going to be
necessary.</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If there was something different about the U.S. economy.</span> <small>(0.767)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the
U.S. economy being different.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload,
pot-boiling-over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was a combination of very
strong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but

also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is just very
unusual.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, you know, we had the view—my colleagues and I broadly had the view—that we
could get a lot of—you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve, because you ran into
the limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren’t workers and because people
couldn’t—the supply chains were all broken.</span> <small>(0.353)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So we, we had the view that you could come
straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you
know, something like that has happened.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It happened so far.</span> <small>(0.361)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question is, you know, once,
once that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort
of supply chain and shortages side has some, some ways to run—does labor force participation
have much more to run?</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It might.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Immigration could help, but it may be that, at some point—at
some point, you will run out of supply-side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets
harder.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s very possible.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be
different, I’d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
just don’t know.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, inflation keeps coming down.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market keeps getting back
into balance.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And it’s so far, so good—although we kind of assume that it will get harder from
here.</span> <small>(0.349)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But so far, it hasn’t.</span> <small>(0.488)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll go to Megan for the last question.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MEGAN CASSELLA.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’s focus now on
proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts.</span> <small>(0.624)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And can you talk us through what the latest
thinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening
at all?</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now,
just to get that out of the way.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected.</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What we’ve been
seeing is, you know, that we’re allowing runoff each month.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s adding up.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’re
down—we’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars].</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s showing up.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The reverse repo facility [take-
up] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or—as a result—or
holding steady.</span> <small>(0.736)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At a certain point, you know, there won’t be any more to come out of, or there’ll
be a level where [take-up at] the reverse repo facility levels out.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, at that point, reserves will
start to come down.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we still have—you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until
we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that
consistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the
balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with
ample reserves.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion
[dollars].</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not—we don’t think we’re at those [levels judged consistent with ample]
reserves.</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There isn’t a lot of evidence of that.</span> <small>(0.712)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re watching it carefully.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, so
far—so far, it’s working pretty much as expected, we think.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time
you’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts?</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that time to rethink, or are you
still going to follow that thinking?</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re asking,
though, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such
time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight?</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the answer is,
Page 23 of 24

it depends on the reason.</span> <small>(0.686)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, if you’re—if you’re—if you’re cutting rates because you’re
going back to normal, that’s one thing, [and distinct from] if you’re cutting them because the
economy is really weak.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you can imagine, you’d have to know what the reason is to know
whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks very much.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
