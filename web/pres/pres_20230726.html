Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 26, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Price stability is the responsibility of the
Federal Reserve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In particular,
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions
that benefit all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and
we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve covered a lot of
ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Looking ahead, we will
continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Although activity
in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear
to be weighing on business fixed investment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor market remains very tight.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past three months, job gains averaged
244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The
unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are some continuing signs that supply and
Page 1 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor force participation rate has
moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">While the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of
available workers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the 12 months
ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In June, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, the process
of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite elevated inflation,
longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our
mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are also continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With today’s action, we’ve raised our
Page 2 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have been seeing the effects of our
policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy,
particularly housing and investment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It will take time, however, for the full effects of our
ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, the economy is
facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely
to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
and economic and financial developments.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 3 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, thank you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You have, I think a couple of times in
your opening remarks, talked about this language “in determining the extent of additional policy
firming that may be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on
the way?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And should we also believe that all future meetings—say, September and November—
are live, or are you in an every-other-meeting mode?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not
something we’ve looked at.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into
each meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we haven’t made any
decisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you
read the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations:
Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the
June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the June CPI
report, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We hope that
inflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we
don’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, what are we going to be looking at?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader
picture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re looking for supply
and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the
labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ll be looking at inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole
collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if we
make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how we’re thinking about
Page 4 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the next meeting and, you know, how we’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially,
but, you know, we’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we
get two more job reports, two more CPI reports.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I think we have an ECI report coming later this
week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say it
is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant
it, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re
going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying
we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Monetary policy,
we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there: You
said the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that
mean there’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that
two more hikes are necessary?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m just going to go back to what I said.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we—you know, that’s
the question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I
recited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it really—we
did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s just one reading, as
everybody knows.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Many
forecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we
see the data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll be focusing on that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEANNA SMIALEK.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ve
seen the Barbie movie numbers.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this
summer.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does seem like
growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I wonder, from your
perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know,
performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’s inflationary, or is it good news
because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just how are you thinking about that sort
of trajectory?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the
economy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any
meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a
good thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s good to see that, of course.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence
coming up and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That will support activity going forward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you’re, you’re
right, though.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that
would require an appropriate response for monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll be watching that carefully
and seeing how it evolves over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELE SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin from Axios.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, as you referenced
earlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look
good.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So if you’re data dependent, why not pause again?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why not stay on hold?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why not take
another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 6 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if you go back to what we’re trying to do here, we’re trying to
achieve a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At
the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that would take—of what that would
take, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say, we looked at
the interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent,
but broadly consistent with expectations.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as a result, we went ahead and, and took another
step.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And that’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but, but gradually
slowing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but, you
know, we’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from, from a single reading.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how we look at it, and, and so
we did take that step today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, markets
widely believe the median FOMC participant’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter
of this year will be too high, given autos and shelter, and that by September, that may warrant a
downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Would that type of inflation
progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below-trend growth and
decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you’ve done enough?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of
this and how much of that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ll be looking at everything.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we’ll, of
course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the
opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be looking at the growth
data.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall
Page 7 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on, on
making progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If I could follow up: Last month you said there were benefits to
moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that
slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
September, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots
of activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision
then.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that
we decide to maintain at that level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves
is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if we
get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee—
then we will move ahead.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining
policy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just
don’t have it yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So consumer
confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of, of the declines in headline
inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long
time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of
3 percent?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side
of the dual mandate?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 8 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I’d say it this way: First, it is—it is a good thing that
headline inflation has come down so much, because that’s really what the public experiences.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a—it
will strengthen the broad sense that, that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will
in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you are really—sorry, your question
was?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I mean, you’ve talked for many press conferences
now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So how much of that are we
still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I would put it this way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s
really a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too
little?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there
really are risks on both sides.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not,
but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do
increasingly face that risk.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down
that far, you know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better
signal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by
volatile energy and food prices.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because
that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And
core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s reason to think it can come down now,
but it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re
Page 9 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we need to
be prepared to raise further if that—if we think that’s appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, and then if inflation were to—just a quick
follow[up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in
unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People are talking
about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but how much?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one—
CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment
rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So that’s a real
blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s not
that we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have
to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and
slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so that is still the, the likely outcome here.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we hope that that’s
as little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not
get it done.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-
term social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on
that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is
volatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the—
that’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Michael McKee.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 10 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MICHAEL MCKEE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we
have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to
the downside.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now
under these conditions?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Do you think you might need to do more, because I’m curious about
what you see as inflation dynamics now?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is the economy still moving in a direction where it
creates more inflation?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have
some large labor settlements.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or is the economy disinflating, and you’re just, you’re able to go
back to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is,
we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to
demand and supply.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to
help ease inflationary pressures.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand
balance, particularly in the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And all of that should lead to declining inflationary
pressures.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re
seeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are
telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have
its full desired effects.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that
inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further
tighten if that is appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long
way to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, do you think under current conditions you are restrictive
enough unless something changes?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 11 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I think—we think, you know, today’s rate hike was
appropriate, and I think we’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at
the next meeting about, is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if it does
tell us that—collectively, if that’s our view—then we will do more.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If September is,
in fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace
that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the
June meeting?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every
other meeting.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could be two out of three meetings, right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could be—it just means if you’re
slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and
closer to, we think, our destination.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every
other meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment
where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes
all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so
that’s what we did.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I, I think it’s possible.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mentioned it before.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s possible that we
would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s
really going to depend on what the data tell us.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s the best we can do.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we shouldn’t assume that every other meeting is the lowest
tightening frequency, let’s say?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could be, you know, longer intervals in between as well?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 12 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’re—look, I think we’re going to—we’re going to make a
decision about the next meeting, and then we’re going to make a decision about the one after
that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think it’ll sort itself out.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, among your
colleagues, there have been people who’ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken
place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it’s
happened very fast this time, and it’s kind of up to date.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Where are you on that continuum?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in
financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation,
right?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our
decisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier
than it—than it used to.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that
it has.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know
that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and
variable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of
the lags.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">First, the first thing to say is, we’re
determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No one should doubt that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would look at it this way, though.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The real federal funds rate is now
in meaningfully positive territory.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the
mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is
Page 13 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well above most estimates of the longer-term neutral rate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would say, monetary policy is
restrictive, more so after today’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on
economic activity and inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not
appropriate to do so.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how I think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are resolutely
committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has proved,
repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at
some point, that may change.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve
come, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the—on the credit side, I’m wondering if you saw
anything in the—in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’re getting a quantum of
credit contraction beyond what you’d expect.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The bank lending data really is—the growth rate’s
edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession
indicator.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I
would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve got
lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it,
it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s really hard to tease
out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the
overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS
will say.</span></p>

RACHEL SIEGEL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what
share of that credit you would give to factors that don’t stem directly from rate hikes or that
might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the
past year?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, interesting question.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So let me start by saying that the
inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and,
and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic
and the response from fiscal and monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ve always expected that the
disinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-
related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which
would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we think
that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down
sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a]
reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s, that’s a
good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both
factors, both that I mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing
an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into
services and away from goods.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And take autos as an example.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The combination of an increase in sales and inventories,
while, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s
Page 15 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also a role for demand, as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
they’re both working there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Housing services inflation now starts to move down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Clearly, higher
rates have, have slowed the housing market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, I would say, monetary policy is
working about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward,
in particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market
will come in as a very, very important factor.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we think both of those—both of those sources
of disinflation are playing an important role.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources,
that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there a more even split
there, too?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward
because we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very
specific pandemic things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and
shortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be
important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">First, let me compliment your tie,
the choice of tie.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a good color.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So thanks for taking our questions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the Beige Book, it
said, “Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably” for
manufacturing sectors.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Is that an indication that there’s a, a wage inflation pressure?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And how
do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that
supply chains and, and shortages are easing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so, what was the first part of it?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 16 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, wage inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Like, how do you—how do you target
wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think what
we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what
we’re seeing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So wages have actually been gradually moving down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re still at levels what
would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, we’re making progress there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And by so many indicators, labor market demand is
cooling.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can
look at the quits rate normalizing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can look at job openings coming down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can look at
just job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it
was at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s actually not a bad thing, in
a sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is
really the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work,
getting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s
gradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want
to get.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But still we see a push to raise minimum wage.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re seeing
a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is, they come out with
agreements like big pay increases, like UPS, and we have the autoworkers coming up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you
concerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contracts, pushing wage inflation
then?</span></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I wanted to ask about the SEP,
which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under
3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And so I’m wondering, is the level of inflation what’s sort of important there as you
think about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which
inflation is falling also important?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think you’d take both into account.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think you’d take everything
into account when you start cutting rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide
range of things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just
is a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s
time to start cutting rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what
happens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after
that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there, what’s motivating people.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So if it’s sort of—sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you
wouldn’t necessarily cut rates?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not giving you any
numerical guidance around that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when
we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It would be—you
know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think the median was several for next
year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,
Page 18 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and it’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is, in fact, coming down to our 2 percent
goal.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE MATTHEWS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the
Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing, and they’ve reduced their forecast for a
recession.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession
being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident
that you can achieve a soft landing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and
my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without
the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in
some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
been my view.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s still my view.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent
with, with what I see today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have
a lot left to go to see that happen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the
forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a
recession.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is
independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Having an independent
staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our
process.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make—
informs our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions.</span></p>

STEVE MATTHEWS.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and
you still have a strong labor market?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, does that add to the optimism?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would—I would
say, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve,
we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s, that’s a really good thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s
very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And consistent with having a soft
landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still
likely as we—as we go forward with this process.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t—
we haven’t really seen that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher
unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the
way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen
participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the
temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it
continues.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEFF COX.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You and other Fed
officials in the past have suggested that you don’t need to keep hiking until inflation hits
2 percent, that—as long as you see continued progress.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I’m wondering, how close do you
need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How many months of data do you need to
Page 20 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
see that will—that will give you sufficient confidence, and how, how far does this fight need to
go before you’re willing to kind of declare victory on it?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to
2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s
clearly not the appropriate way to think about it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we,
we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a
grain of salt.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal
funds rate is at a restrictive level now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a
restrictive level anymore.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and
then below a neutral level at a certain point.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we would, you know, we would—we, of
course, would be very careful about that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming
down in a sustainable level.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical
assessment of when and where that would be.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d
start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before
you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation
until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.</span></p>

acquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt, or are you

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
comfortable saying that we’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this
point?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And how does this play into your outlook for policy?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I
will say, things have settled down for sure out there.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Deposit flows have stabilized.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Capital and
liquidity remain strong.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up
significantly year over year.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, we’re still watching,
you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the
banking sector.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were,
were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more
affected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort
of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They may be
tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are
tightening.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think—I think
we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think—I think, basically,
we’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s,
that’s going to restrain economic activity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is restraining economic activity.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s how I
would look at it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And how is that informing your outlook for setting
policy?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 22 of 28

CHAIR POWELL.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we—that goes—that’s—an expected result of tightening
interest rate policy is that—is that bank credit conditions—bank lending conditions would
tighten as well.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened
in May?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just don’t think we know that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’re looking at the current data in GDP, and
we’re seeing strong spending.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re seeing a strong economy, and it’s made us confident that
we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I—it
seems like the economy is weathering this well, but, of course, we’re watching it carefully and,
and expect to continue to do that.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MEGAN CASSELLA.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary
impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer
sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we’ve been seeing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that
increases in] real wages are positive.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, that’s a great thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, we want that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
want people to have [gains in] real wages.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s
consistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages
have been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We expect to see more of
that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We don’t really think
that, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I
would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Labor market conditions
broadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we
think we need some further softening in labor market conditions.</span></p>

MEGAN CASSELLA.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you
mentioned at the start how you’re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might
be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families
if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment
back down.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s the message there of, of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise
them?</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get
inflation under control.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit
those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get
inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think that is the most
important thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away
are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or,
you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re
just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right
away.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People, people
on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we need—we need to
get this done.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we
don’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s, that’s how I would explain what
we’re doing.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SIMON RABINOVITCH.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon Rabinovitch with the

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
Page 24 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the event, the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate
move that you announced today.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The decision was, of course, unanimous, and the statement was
basically unchanged from last month.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting
actually a live one?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision
was, was actually going to be?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I mean, you could—“Was there doubt?”</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look, I would say
there’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks, you’ll
see that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should
do at the next meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many times when we go
into a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, we have the
meeting, and some—some—some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others, and I’ll
just leave it at that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Evan.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Evan Ryser, Market News International.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks—the dollar, the
stock market, et cetera.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come
down to target?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course,
very focused on rates and our own policy.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy
tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication
is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could
mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what tends to happen,
Page 25 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though, is, financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we’re doing, and, and,
ultimately, over time, we get where we need to go.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If I could also ask about the SEP from June that showed rate cuts—do
you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So that, that could happen.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question is, you know, is that
consistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world
where things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more
normal levels.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to
continue it, depending on where you are in the cycle.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So they are two independent things.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you can imagine circumstances
in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different
ways.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that wouldn’t be the case.</span></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
have a question about the discount window.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m wondering if, since the bank failures of the
spring, if you’ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that
they’re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether
policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to, to show that
they are prepared to use it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s a very important thing.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And yes to both sides of that.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window,
and we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We did find, as you know,
during the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It can be a little

clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So why not be in a situation where, where
you’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Mark Hamrick.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MARK HAMRICK.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve talked in the
past about getting the housing market back into better balance—excuse me—and also that the
market might have bottomed.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right
now, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might
otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and,
of course, also all of that happening with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage still around 7 percent
on the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’re talking about tightening industry lending
standards?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are we getting closer to balance or farther away?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What’s your sense?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the
reasons that you talked about.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have
low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going
to because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing
homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">On the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and,
and there are people coming in.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming
in, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think this will take some time to work through.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Hopefully, more supply comes on line,
and, you know, we, we work through it.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath
of the—of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</span></p>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy Marshall-Genzer with
Marketplace.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage
through the Black Sea, and alternative routes at this point could be closed off.</span></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Just wondering,
how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, and how closely are you
watching that?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are watching it, of course, very closely.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you’re right.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The
withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security,
particularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Grain prices did go up on
this news, but they remain well below their peaks of last spring.</span></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And the moves that we’ve seen
so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of
course, we will be watching that situation carefully.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you don’t think it would have a big effect on Fed
policy at this point?</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You wouldn’t say so looking at what we—what we
know now.</span></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks very much.</span></p>
