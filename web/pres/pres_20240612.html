Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 12, 2024
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the
past two years.</span> <small>(0.774)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains
and a low unemployment rate.</span> <small>(0.369)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to
2.7 percent but is still too high.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent
goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.589)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in
order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more to say
about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.851)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to
1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory
investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on
underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half
of 2023.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains
solid.</span> <small>(0.380)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last
year.</span> <small>(0.755)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance
of the U.S. economy over the past year.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee
participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median
projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 1 of 27

In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong
but a bit below that seen in the first quarter.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low
at 4 percent.</span> <small>(0.661)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25
to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth has eased over
the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Overall, a broad set of indicators
suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve
of the pandemic—relatively tight but not overheated.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">FOMC participants expect labor market
strength to continue.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the
end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal
of 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The consumer price
index—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE, PCE price index—
rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.</span> <small>(0.346)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The
inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly
readings have eased somewhat.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters,
as well as measures from financial markets.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median projection in the SEP for total PCE
inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials

like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.662)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As
labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance.</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The economic
outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the
federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably
toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The most
recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there
has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We will need to see more good
data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.548)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of
the progress that we’ve seen on inflation.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or
too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In considering any
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this
year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But these projections are
Page 3 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
not a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As the economy evolves, assessments of the
appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment
and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we’re prepared to
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If the labor
market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated,
we’re prepared to respond.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that
we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll continue to make our decisions
meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the
balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and
stable prices.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price stability is essential to
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our success in delivering
on these goals matters to all Americans.</span> <small>(0.783)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that our actions affect communities,
families, and businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public
mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and
price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Just wondering
if you could walk me through the Committee’s average inflation forecast—core PCE is now
forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year-end.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s already 2.75, and after today’s number, there
were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month.</span> <small>(0.624)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that tell
Page 4 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and, in fact, that it’s going to
get worse?</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And if you have this wrong, doesn’t it mean that you sort of—you, you could have
wrong the outlook for rates there?</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in
the second half of last year—June through December, really.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re now lapping those.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
as you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes
in.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The new reading gets added to the 12-month window.</span> <small>(0.732)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s just a, a slight element of
conservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly
PCE and core PCE numbers.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And if
you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the
12-month, you know, reading.</span> <small>(0.346)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right?</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just
the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.</span> <small>(0.716)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If we were to get more readings like today’s
reading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s just a forecasting device.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think, I
think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But if it comes in—just to follow up—if it comes in the way you
forecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah—no.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we
don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more
confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that
this rules that in or out.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month
by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
If we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or, or
remain the same.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that’s, that’s a really good place to
be.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.786)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, if I look at
the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut—two cuts
this year—fairly evenly split between the two.</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so I wonder if you could explain a little
more the nuances or the differences there.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Would two or three more inflation readings like the
one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk
to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their
Summary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and
everything.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a
range of plausible outcomes.</span> <small>(0.778)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”—
you know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re so close for me.”</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These are
very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And as, I think,
you’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or
two.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I
think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No one—no one brings
to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular
rate path.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their
own reaction function.</span> <small>(0.735)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I
Page 6 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
don’t hold it with high confidence.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think if you’re looking for—and, and don’t really
think that they’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “this is what I think is the right
thing.”</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try
to—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think in terms of what
we need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I’m not going to be specific about
how many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s
going to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with
the balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth.</span> <small>(0.361)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You
look at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident?</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Have we reached an appropriate level of
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see
really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which
is—which is another thing that could, could happen.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, again, we don’t see that.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I—we
do see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that
would warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And if I could quickly follow up—did, did you or any of your
colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation
numbers today?</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen.</span> <small>(0.376)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It just is, you
know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So when
that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—
Page 7 of 27

what we do is, we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update.</span> <small>(0.652)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We tell
them how to do that.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and some people do; some people don’t.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Most, most people don’t.</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that.</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, you
know—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can,
you know, reflect it in one day.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow.</span> <small>(0.395)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll
know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the initial CPI reading
and its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jonnelle.</span> <small>(0.562)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JONNELLE MARTE.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you
noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So do you think that there
still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent,
or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that
many of those imbalances have eased?</span> <small>(0.357)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind
of overheated two years ago.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance
between supply and demand.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, what have we seen?</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen labor force supply come up
quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.</span> <small>(0.387)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s ongoing, mostly
now through the immigration channel.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor
force.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving
down.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve seen job openings moving down.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen wage increases moving from very,
Page 8 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
very high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We have seen
unemployment creep up now sixth-tenths over the course of, of a year or so very, very gradually.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent
unemployment—historically low.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and,
you know, that’s an important statistic.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation.</span> <small>(0.373)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument
that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong.</span> <small>(0.352)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what we
see.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor
market very carefully—and that’s what we see.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see gradual cooling—gradual moving
toward better balance.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that,
but we really don’t see that.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As a quick follow-up—the surveys that make up the jobs report
are, are showing different tales.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s been some divergence, especially, we saw, in the last
report that we got on Friday.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So how do you interpret that, and, and how does it change your
view on the labor market?</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You just
have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s why it always makes
sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one
report.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the
household survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, I mean, we’re left
with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, the
overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Job openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of
Page 9 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
unemployed people.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The jobs–workers gap is still a significantly positive number—greater than
it was before the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, overall, we’re looking at what is still a very strong labor market
but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NEIL IRWIN.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Neil Irwin, with Axios.</span> <small>(0.717)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Back on the rates path:
The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March—that’s a period in
which the economic data flow hasn’t been that dramatic a shift.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How, how—can you provide
some color on what changed in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to, to
see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So the
inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, as I mentioned
earlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this?</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We had really, really good
inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the
confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might
take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know?</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we—there
are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, so you
really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would
have been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, you get another—you
get data—different data today.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll have to see where the data light the way.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
we’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,
and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ll just
Page 10 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have to see what, what—what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the
outlook and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEANNA SMIALEK.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for taking our
questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the Summary of Economic Projections, the long-run interest rate forecast moved
up a bit.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as
restrictive as we’ve previously expected.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, how should we interpret what that means
about how the Committee views its current policy setting?</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move
up.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a
long-run concept.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed.</span> <small>(0.662)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And what it is
is the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and
price stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s—
it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today we’ve got a very specific economy
with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.852)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s—I, I don’t think that
the, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But,
honestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is
in the near term.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because
I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their,
their pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures.</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now,
we, we can’t really know that.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,
but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving
Page 11 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
forces.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, there’s a really good question about whether, whether those really have
changed or whether, instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a, a series of persistent but,
ultimately, temporary shocks.</span> <small>(0.839)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s been the debate, and we can’t know.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in the meantime,
we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have.</span> <small>(0.773)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I
also—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of
“How restrictive is policy?”</span> <small>(0.641)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question of whether it’s
sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think for the reasons I’ve
talked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear
that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider, with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Just
to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of
tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to
market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you
weren’t quite there yet?</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I think this is about,
you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on
inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Is the labor market still strong?”</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
what we’re thinking about.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language
you’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability,
and another goal, which is maximum employment.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How are we doing there?</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think we’ve
got a good, strong labor market still.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think we’ve been making progress toward the price-
Page 12 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability goal.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then for a while, there was a pause.</span> <small>(0.571)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we look at today’s thing, and we
think, “Well, that’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that.”</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, in the
meantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?”</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think we think, “Yes, it’s
about right.”</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting
the things that we would want to get, broadly speaking.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s why we’ve been at this
policy rate now for almost a year.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, so just to follow up on that—I think one, one curious
thing here is, you’ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the
major things for all of this year.</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve got growth that stays above long-run potential
throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long-run estimate—
right?—of 4.2.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So this isn’t a story of slack improving inflation.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So where’s the improvement in
inflation coming from that it’s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from—
let’s start with that.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just
the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and
demand.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by
restrictive monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.765)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So those two things have been working together.</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve also had a
very positive supply shock on the labor side.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply
shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’ve had, you
know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of
inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest
of this year brinks—brings.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.</span> <small>(0.395)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I mean,
ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand?</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and we don’t know that,
Page 13 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, look at today’s report.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, if we see more like that—you know, we
don’t—we can’t know what the future holds.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in the meantime, we’ve made pretty good
progress on inflation with our current stance.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHAEL MCKEE.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The base
case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but
your growth forecast doesn’t see any slowdown in the rest of the year, nor does the
unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And your inflation
forecasts basically average out to no change.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So if, at the end of the year, there is no change
from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What, what would be the point
for a rate cut?</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we think,
ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real
weakening in the economy.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise
rates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.</span> <small>(0.358)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Not to eliminate the
possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the
Committee does.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s what
we’ve been getting.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at
a—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, ultimately, we think rates will have
to come down to continue to support that.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, so far, they haven’t had to.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know,
that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t really see that.</span> <small>(0.381)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We kind
of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the

labor market while we’re continuing to make progress on inflation.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re getting—we’re
getting good results here.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, to follow up: Is there any kind of concern for the housing
industry or financial stability—banks—in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.</span> <small>(0.717)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean,
ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we
can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There will still be a
national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.817)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There will still be one, but the
distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in
terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.</span> <small>(0.732)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks.</span> <small>(0.744)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had the turmoil earlier
last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up
their capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the banking system, you
know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.</span> <small>(0.737)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I was
wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see
inflationary pressure in the economy.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance,
and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You’re seeing, you know, anecdotal
stories of, the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald’s
announcing a $5 meal deal.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but
Page 15 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy—and wonder if you
could tell us more about that.</span> <small>(0.406)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have
come down.</span> <small>(0.543)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know—and I
think you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on
goods, which is kind of hard to understand.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some
signal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services.</span> <small>(0.756)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re seeing—you’re
continuing to see high readings there to some extent.</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation
from earlier pressures.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, I mean, overall, you’re right.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflationary pressures have come
down.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Wages are still running,
you know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and
trend productivity.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we haven’t
thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But at the same time,
getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which
is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">There’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected
this year.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do
to the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end
of the year or even two?</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think if, you know—if you look back in 5 or 10 years and, and try
to pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of one 25 basis point rate cut, you’d, you’d have
quite a job on your hands.</span> <small>(0.650)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s not how we look at it—you know, really, the whole rate
path matters.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen
policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions.</span> <small>(0.746)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the
market will price in what it prices in.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t—I have no way of saying—we’re, we’re not at that
stage, so I don’t know what we’ll be thinking about at that time.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s a consequential
decision for the economy.</span> <small>(0.743)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we, we have the ability to, you know, approach this
question carefully.</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And we will approach it carefully while we’re very much keeping an eye on,
you know, downside economic risks, should they—should they emerge.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you’ve been talking about this clear sense that it’s just going to
take longer to have the confidence that’s needed for rate cuts.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is there something about what
happened in the first couple of months of the year that you’re seeing differently now with more
time or hindsight?</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting
that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the
parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So—but we had a
quarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we
shouldn’t have taken signal from.”</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it is what it is.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to
take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the
signal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that

inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.”</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s what we said.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that was

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I still think that’s the right thing to do.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Now we have today’s inflation

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to have to see what the

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re looking for something that

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And readings like
today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction.</span> <small>(0.656)</small></p>

economic data but don’t feel good about this economy?</span> <small>(0.684)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, you know—I, I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer
why people are, are not as happy about the economy as they might be.</span> <small>(0.735)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t tell people
how they should think or feel about the economy.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s not our job.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—you know, people
experience what they experience.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is,
we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve got a very strong labor market with
unemployment at 4 percent.</span> <small>(0.351)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of
time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had a period of high
inflation.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can
to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re confident that we’ll get there.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful
for, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high

inflation.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is people who—lower-income people—people who are at the margins of the
economy who, who have the worst experience—who experience the most pain from inflation.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that
we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">As just a quick follow-up here—you’ve indicated one interest rate cut
sometime this year.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I know you don’t have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are
watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For everybody who’s
out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But what we
said is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back
down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So having that kind
of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,
to all Americans, for a long period of time.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had that period for a very long time.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We very
much want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a
concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We were there for a long time, and
our goal is to get back to that place.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in
the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m just drawing on the change in the
statement on there being “modest further progress” on inflation.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, halfway, you know,
through the year and after today’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee
members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And just in terms of the
Page 19 of 27

June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?</span> <small>(0.753)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth,
clearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see
still-strong growth—solid growth this year.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s been very encouraging.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">If you go back a
year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a
recession—many forecasters had that.</span> <small>(0.379)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s not what happened.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Instead, we—the U.S. is,
anyway, and it’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the
world.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s been encouraging.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say that the, the—today’s inflation report is
encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You asked about—your second question was really about shelter inflation.</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think if
you go back a couple of years—we, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you
know, people who own their houses.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we have OER, which is owners’ equivalent rent.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the—of the—when the
economy reopened, they really went up sharply.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those play into rollover rents much more
slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.</span> <small>(0.764)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and so what we—so we, we’ve
found now that there are big lags.</span> <small>(0.397)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in,
in market rents.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain—are going at—up at relatively low levels—and
they still are—you know, this, this is just going to happen.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It just is going to happen more slowly

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we, we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to, to owned

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s something that the—you know, that the, the price experts have regularly looked at.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is not something that we’re the only country that does, and it’s not something we’re looking at
changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it—it’s true.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s one of the
very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services
that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they’re actually living in it.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And some countries—you should just ignore that.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But that’s not our—that’s not how we do
inflation here.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we do it the way we do it, and we’ve been very transparent about it.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And,
you know, it’s true that we’re—we’re seeing delays in, in realizing what—what’s happening
economically.</span> <small>(0.435)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we understand that—you know, we understand that very well.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>

the question, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.793)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The last jobs report
showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s up 8.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And since January of 2021, we’ve seen prices rise 19 percent.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So people are using their credit
cards to pay for their lifestyle.</span> <small>(0.697)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy
could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income
during big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is
people spending more on their credit cards.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That—that has been happening.</span> <small>(0.378)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Credit card
balances have been going up.</span> <small>(0.624)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Credit card defaults have been going up.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re not at high
levels.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.</span> <small>(0.720)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They couldn’t spend money.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home.</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But households

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’ve now worked off a lot
of that.</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, we’re watching that carefully.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, what do we see?</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what
we see.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household
sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of
shape it was in a year or two ago.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So how close then are we to that point where the consumer
can’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can’t hire like they’re hiring?</span> <small>(0.478)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So consumer spending is still growing.</span> <small>(0.350)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s not growing at the pace it
was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, by the way,
other parts of the economy are picking up.</span> <small>(0.752)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has
picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—
you know, tech plants.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know—
something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for
the U.S. economy.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, no, you’re, you’re right, though.</span> <small>(0.463)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we do see the same thing other
people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower-income
people.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is, is to foster a very strong jobs economy,
which we think we have done—ultimately to get inflation under control, because those people
experience inflation, you know, very directly—very painfully.</span> <small>(0.415)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and, you know, once, once
we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which, which will also improve things.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>

unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I was just
wondering—can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it more of, like, a

quicker pace of people losing jobs?</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to
start to go above 4.2 or something like that?</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How are you thinking about what you’re looking
for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is
more than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we’ll be looking at everything.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the
ability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So waiting for that to happen is,
is not what we’re doing.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance
of risks.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all
of it—the whole situation.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy
could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.</span> <small>(0.532)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I, you know, I would just—
you know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And if we saw troubling—weakening
more than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
we’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So something like negative payroll numbers would be—

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.</span> <small>(0.372)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in—Japan and some
emerging markets are suffering from the strong dollar.</span> <small>(0.802)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I want to know if it is having a
positive impact on U.S. economy in total?</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the
Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing
things about the level of the dollar.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So for us, it’s just another financial variable.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you’re
right—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last
year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong.</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t think of it as benefiting or hurting
the U.S. We don’t—again, we don’t manage the level of the dollar.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s not our—

to foster is maximum employment and price stability.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we feel like we’ve made good
progress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year.</span> <small>(0.690)</small></p>

Yahoo Finance.</span> <small>(0.781)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re
forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE.</span> <small>(0.499)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re at 2.8 percent, of course,
on core PCE.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to
2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You also indicated the
job market has mostly normalized.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So why not cut rates this summer just once—you’re well
above neutral—to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest
for confidence for inflation?</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks
here, let me just say.</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of
economic activity, of employment, of the expansion.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We understand that if we move too, too
quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over,
and it could be very disruptive.</span> <small>(0.363)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and
just basically trying to manage them.</span> <small>(0.656)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t
think it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is
moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s—that’s kind of been our test.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market
conditions.</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s our—that’s our
dual mandate there.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we, we have a strong economy.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve got growth—all
forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk.</span> <small>(0.466)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the meantime, as that time approaches, we
will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Within scope would
certainly be communications generally.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that
particular thing.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get

prematurely into a conversation until it’s really time to have it.</span> <small>(0.661)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so, you know, I’m going to
leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.</span> <small>(0.614)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Go to Nancy, for the last question.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nancy Marshall-Genzer, with
Marketplace.</span> <small>(0.738)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Just one more question on housing—can you still cut rates with shelter prices high,
or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable, like housing
prices moderating, that would really decide or decide against what we’re doing.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’ve got an
overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a
sustainable basis.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s our overall test.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the
labor market.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So those are—those are two different tests.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say, you know, we’re not—
we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “That’s the one.”</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t
target housing prices, for example.</span> <small>(0.682)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t target wages.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We, we target aggregate prices
and overall employment, so—
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow
down the pace of rate cuts?</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think you’d look at the over—we’d be looking at the aggregate
numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What’s going on here with inflation in the—at the
aggregate level?”</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And, you know—and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing
inflation would, would matter.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter,
too, but I wouldn’t single out housing as having a, a special role there.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you very much.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
