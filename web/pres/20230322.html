Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
March 22, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly
address recent developments in the banking sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at
a small number of banks have emerged.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>History has shown that isolated banking problems, if
left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the
banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of
households and businesses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve,
working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S.
economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These actions demonstrate
that all depositors’ savings and the banking system are safe.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With the support of the Treasury,
the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that
hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This
program, along with our long-standing discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual
funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is
available.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will
continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our
tools as needed to keep it safe and sound.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons
from this episode and to work to prevent episodes—events like this from happening again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy: Inflation remains too high, and
the labor market continues to be very tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>My colleagues and I understand the hardship that
high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to
our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Without price
Page 1 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stability, the economy does not work for anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In particular, without price stability, we will
not achieve a sustained period of long—of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend
pace of 0.9 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some
of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed
investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As shown in our
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4
percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run
normal growth rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the
downside.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Yet the labor market remains extremely tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Job gains have picked up in recent months,
with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor force participation
rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>However,
with job vacancies still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available
workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come
into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median
unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and
4.6 percent at the end of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 2 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the 12 months
ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Core PCE—excluding those, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In February, the
12-month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was
5.5 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of
these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median
projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year,
and 2.1 percent in 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way
to go and is likely to be bumpy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as
well as measures from financial markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¾ to 5 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we are continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger
than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We believe,
Page 3 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter
credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary
policy should respond.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate
increases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional
policy firming may be appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess
the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor
market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds
rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the
economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the
federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.3 percent at the end of 2024, and
3.1 percent at the end of 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These are little changed from our December projections,
reflecting offsetting factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our meeting—
decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the vincoming data and their implications
for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer
run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 4 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses
across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the Fed will do
everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How confident is
the Committee that the recent stress that we’ve seen, and you’ve alluded to, is contained at this
point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound
and it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We took powerful actions with [the]
Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the
banking system is safe.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal
review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, just a quick follow-up: I mean, given all the stress and the
uncertainty that you’ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a—was a pause
considered for this meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the
meeting, and you see the decision that we made, which I’ll say a couple things about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First, it
was supported by a very strong consensus, and I’ll be happy to explain why.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And, really, it is
that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and,
really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the
Page 5 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
year more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December—at the time of the
December meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We are committed to restoring price stability, and all of the evidence says
that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent
over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result
in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on
demand, on the labor market, and on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Such a tightening in financial conditions would
work in the same direction as rate tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In principle, as a matter of fact, you can think of it
as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that; of course, it’s not possible to
make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So our decision was to move ahead
with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to
some, some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So going
forward, as I mentioned, in assessing the need for, for further hikes, we’ll be focused as always
on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular, on our assessment of the actual
and expected effects of credit tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate
increases and firming?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without
you increasing rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Really, I would
focus on, on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Ongoing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we
clearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the
uncertainty about what will happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very
Page 6 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
modest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy,
in which case inflation will continue to be strong—in which case, you know, the path will look—
might look different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant
tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary
policy may have less work to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We simply don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you have concerns that the recent—that the hike you did today
could further exacerbate the problem in the banks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused
on macroeconomic outcomes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening
and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think when we think about
the situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular
our lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, in your
testimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Obviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I realize there’s a lot of
uncertainty, but can you—can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your
colleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit
availability because of the stress in the banking sector, or are you waiting to see it in the data
before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we have just come from an FOMC meeting and, you
know, the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I’ll tell you what I
heard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would
Page 7 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
be some, some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as, as
our policies do, and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did
turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So some people did
reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think there may also just have been—
remember, this is 12 days ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent
and it’s people—you know, it’s very difficult, there’s so much uncertainty.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So December was a
good place to start, and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for
December.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of
the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that pointed
to higher rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then this, this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions
tightening really, really offset that, effectively.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To follow up: Have you considered at all whether your primary tool,
the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you
believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Have you, for
example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the System Open
Market Account, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don’t accelerate
deposit erosion, for example, from banks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no,
we think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate
hikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wanted to ask—you, along
with the FDIC and the Treasury—the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to
Page 8 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was just wondering if you could
speak to why that decision was made.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern
that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of
these banks?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the
risk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That was the
issue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, and then can you also—just to follow up, can you speak to
the role that you will be playing in the Fed’s internal investigation on its supervision and
regulation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And he’s
responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—I realized, you know, right
away that, that there was going to be a need for review.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, the question we’re all asking
ourselves over that first weekend was, how did this happen?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so what we did was, early
Monday morning, we sat down and said, “Let’s do this.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And he, he was obviously going to lead
it in his capacity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I don’t—my role was to announce it, and I get briefed on it, but I’m not
involved in, in the work of it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider from Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I
want to go back to your February press conference.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You mentioned the word “disinflation,” I
believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully
under way, or something like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 9 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the
question 12 times, so it’s—maybe it’s a feature, not a bug.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, so, but yeah, absolutely the
same—the story is intact, so it’s really three parts, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Goods inflation has been coming down
now for six months; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it’s certainly
proceeding.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Housing services is, is really a matter of time passing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We continue to see the new
leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s 44 percent of the—of the core
PCE index, where you’ve got a story that’s ongoing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Where we didn’t have in February, and we
still don’t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And that is, you
know, that’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some
softening in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t see that yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s, that’s of course
56 percent of the index.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the story is pretty much the same.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I will say that the inflation data
that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don’t see
more coming from the credit crunch, because it seems to me that’s something that you’d actually
welcome to a degree and expect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And are you not seeing more coming from that because you
don’t know, or because you just don’t want to have another round of wishful thinking?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a
great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity,
hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Very large body of literature.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question is, how significant will this
credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s the issue.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t really
see it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s
very kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we think it’s, it’s potentially
Page 10 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
quite real and that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we think about further
rate hikes for us, we’ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wonder if you could talk a little bit—I know that you’ve
got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think
happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about
regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I wonder, you know,
how can the American people have confidence that there aren’t other weaknesses out there in the
banking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me say what, what I think happened, and then I’ll come to the
questions around supervision.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed
badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and
interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and
intervened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know that the public saw all this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know that SVB experienced an
unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So this is a—this is a very large group of
connected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster
than historical record would suggest.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of
supervision and regulation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How did
this happen is the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What went wrong?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Try to find that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will find that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then
make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again,
and then implement those policies.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my
views on what the answers might be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I simply can’t do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Vice Chair Barr is
Page 11 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
leading this, and I think he’s testifying next week.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but that will be up to him.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s
really where it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is
clear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and
regulation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I, I
plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And the final point—you know, can we feel confident that these
weaknesses don’t exist elsewhere, given that they got missed at this bank?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through
the banking system.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its
percentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And again,
supervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were—
they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that’s really the nature
of the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve
been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them
there for quite some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Following today’s decision, the markets have now priced in one more
increase in May, and then every meeting the rest of this year they’re pricing in rate cuts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are
they getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you’re
looking at it, given that you’re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to
ongoing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows
that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and
Page 12 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market, with inflation moving down gradually.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In that most likely case, if
that happens, participants don’t see rate cuts this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They just don’t.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would just say: As
always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens
rather than what we write down in the SEP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s not our baseline expectation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the
rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is
based on being—it will be sufficiently restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or is it leavened by the idea of you don’t
know what&#39;s going to happen?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In other words, what should people think about in terms of how
the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s going to depend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of
our monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is
there going to be some tightening in credit conditions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then we’re thinking about that as
effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to
2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes: It can come from, you know,
from tighter credit conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re looking at, and we, we—it’s highly uncertain how long
the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be, so we’re just
going to have to watch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In the meantime, you know—obviously, at the end of the day, we will
do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No one should doubt that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Rachel Siegel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank
you for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I know we’ve talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was
unique to a certain sector of the economy, but there’s also growing concern that there are
Page 13 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll
over later this year and next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those
loans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of—what we saw with SVB to banks that
disproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in
commercial real estate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I really don’t think it’s comparable to this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The, the banking system is,
is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it’s well capitalized, and I really don’t see that as at all
analogous to this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And one other question: Would you be open to an independent
investigation, separate from the Fed’s probe?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I welcome—it’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent
investigations and outside investigations and all that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we welcome—when a bank fails, there
are investigations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, we welcome that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence from Fox
Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has been rather sticky, so do you need help from the fiscal side to get
inflation down faster?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t assume that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t give advice to the fiscal authorities,
and we assume that—we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model
along with a million other things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We have responsibility for price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Federal
Reserve has responsibility for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And nothing’s going to change that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So—and we will get
inflation down to 2 percent in time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 14 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if I can follow on that, but they’re working—the
spending that’s happened is working against what you are doing, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s prolonging
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You have to look at, at the impulse from spending because spending
was, of course, tremendously high during the pandemic, and then, as the pandemic programs
rolled off, spending actually came down, so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s
driving inflation right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving
inflation, but that’s not really the story now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Neil Irwin.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Two questions about aspects of
the government’s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First, why is this new
bank funding facility done under emergency 13(3) authority, as opposed to expansion of the
discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that’s been around a long time?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, second, can you discuss the Fed’s role in the—in the FDIC guarantee of uninsured
depositors and why there’s $143 billion on your balance sheets last week, supporting that deposit
guarantee?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So 13(3) seemed like the right—we have a little more
flexibility under section 13(3).</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
needed to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 13(3).</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Really
no magic to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s only available in unusual and exigent circumstances, and it has to be—
meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So with the FDIC, we’re just,
we’re lending to the, in effect, we’re—we’re lending to the bridge bank.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s where the
Page 15 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
funds came from, and it’s—it’s a loan that’s 100 percent guaranteed by the FDIC, so there’s no
risk in it for us.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, Chris Rugaber.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRIS RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The SEB—SEP
suggests one more rate hike, as does the change in the language in the statement and which
suggests that you’re perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Do you feel, though, that if
inflation remains high, you’ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed, or have you
somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank
you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, absolutely not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, we, if we need to raise hike—raise rates
higher, we will.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think for now though we, we—as I’ve mentioned, we see the likelihood of, of
credit tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We know that can have, you know, an effect on the macroeconomy, on
demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that
is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
we’ll be watching all those things, and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight
enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll find ourselves at that place.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KYLE CAMPBELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell—thanks for taking the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kyle Campbell
with American Banker.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First of all, I’m
curious at what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount
window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing
the balance sheet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m also curious what your thoughts are on the—not just the availability
Page 16 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you
might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear
about how I’m thinking about these recent developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the recent liquidity provision that
has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different
from what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term
securities.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance
of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which
supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The balance sheet expansion is
really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent
tensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We do believe that it’s
working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and
thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in
financial conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of the distribution of reserves, we, we don’t see ourselves as, as running into
reserve shortages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to, to run off
predictably, predicatbly and passively is working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And of course we’re, we’re always prepared
to, to change that if that changes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Catarina.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CATARINA SARAIVA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
minutes of the January–February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the
possibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on
bank portfolios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion—kind of what was talked
Page 17 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
about in light of that, and then why didn’t the Fed, you know, do anything about that at that point
to ultimately prevent, you know, what happened this month?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s
been quite an interesting seven weeks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have
been presentations about, about interest rate risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not
a surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long-
duration securities that have lost value as, as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate
increases.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s not a surprise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I think, as you know, as is now in the public record,
the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and
was escalating but, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that’s really the
purpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to
understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we
need to change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that, the speed of the
run, it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it does kind of suggest that there’s a
need for possible, you know, regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and
regulation need to keep up with what’s, what’s happening in the world.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these
escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will have to come back to you on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very
much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors’ savings in the banking system
are safe.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Shouldn’t Congress
Page 18 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have a say in that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1 billion in assets
failed, are you promising to bail out all of its depositors?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I’m not saying anything more than I’m saying.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but what
I’m saying is you’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of
serious harm to the economy or to—or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those
tools.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think depositors should assume that their—that their deposits are safe.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Greg Robb.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GREG ROBB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was
wondering if you could give us a little bit more color.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You gave just a little bit of color.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend—you said the question you guys asked
was “How did this happen?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>when you saw Silicon Valley Bank.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I was wondering if you
could go to the Credit Suisse merger.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, wasn’t that the big gorilla in the room?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Aren’t—
didn’t you breathe a sigh of relief when that merger happened?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, we—that was really the Swiss government that
we of course were, were following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with
their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It seems
to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been—
the markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that
it might not go well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going
well so far.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In the Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC sees the unemployment rate
Page 19 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
increasing to 4.5 percent this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from
snowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand
slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The costs of bringing it
down—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent, but the costs of failing are much
higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank
doesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain
anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to
invest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re looking to avoid that and,
you know, to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century, and
get there as quickly as we can.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I guess the question is, historically, it’s hard to—
historically, it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I, I—the question is, do you worry
about some sort of snowball effect, and how do you factor that into your projections and your
thoughts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear,
and so they’re very hard to model.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, the models all work in a kind of linear way—if
you have more of this, you get more of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to
be nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We don’t
know—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on
getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most
benefit the people we serve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong
Page 20 of 23

March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
labor markets through these long expansions that we’ve had.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Four of the five longest, or three of
the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high-inflation period.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or,
you know, an expansion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and
we had several of those, and they’re very good for people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You see late in an expansion—you
see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the
wage spectrum.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jean Young with Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just wanted to ask,
with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibility of a soft landing for the
U.S. economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know it’s, it’s too early to say, really, whether these events have
had much of an effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I
guess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
know, the question will be how long this period is sustained.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The longer it’s sustained, then the
greater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so
we’ll just have to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think
that pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just wondering: How many financial institutions have been issued matters
requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point?</div>

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How many?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But those are serious—those are serious
regulatory, in particular immediate attention, and that’s—and I guess there were six of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and getting to the seriousness of it, how are you
going to ensure that banks comply with these citations, take them seriously—how will you
enforce them?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review
will be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what
you think about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What can we do to make sure that—but, again, that’s not for me to answer
today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Do you have specific thoughts on that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well I, I—see, if I did, I wouldn’t share them because I, I really, you
know, this review is going on, and, you know, I want nothing other than us to find out what
happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s all I want.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed, or partially informed, thoughts,
it, you know, just isn’t appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a real serious review going on with, with people
from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this, you know, to this work,
not connected to this bank, and under, again, Vice Chair Barr’s leadership, and I’m confident
that it will produce a satisfactory result.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Okay, we’ll go to Jennifer for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Curious—how do you view financial conditions right now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If credit becomes
expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’re watching for, would that situation
warrant a rate cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What situation would warrant a rate cut?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And have the bank failures

prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we haven’t really talked about changing the balance sheet
implementation—that’s not something we’ve discussed yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I mentioned, we’re always
willing to change that if we conclude that it’s appropriate, but we’re really not seeing any signs
there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a—
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Curious how you view financial conditions now and, if
credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by
more than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest]
rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we think
that, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there are other measures which, if they’re focused on, you know—bank lending
conditions and things like that—they show some more tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question for us, though,
is, how significant will that be and how, you know—what will be the extent of it and what will
be the duration of it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then—and then, you know, once you have—once you know that,
there’s a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands—how that works
its way into the economy [and] over what period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, you know, we’ll be looking to
see the first part of that—like how serious is this, and does it look like it’s going to be sustained,
and if it is, you know, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would
factor that into our policy decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mentioned with rate cuts, rate cuts are not in our base
case, and, you know, so that’s all I have to say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you very much.</div>
