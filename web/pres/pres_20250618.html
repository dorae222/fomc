Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
June 18, 2025
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The
unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.</span> <small>(0.402)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-
run objective.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our
policy interest rate unchanged.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us
well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</span> <small>(0.767)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ll have more
to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.851)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the
first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports
ahead of potential tariffs.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Private
domestic final purchases, or PDFP, as we call them—which excludes net exports, inventory
investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Within PDFP, growth
of consumer spending moderated, while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded
from weakness in the fourth quarter.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a
decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook,
largely reflecting trade policy concerns.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It remains to be seen how these developments might
affect future spending and investment.</span> <small>(0.825)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median
participant projects GDP to rise 1.4 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year—somewhat
slower than projected in March.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 1 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In the labor market, conditions have remained solid.</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Payroll job gains averaged
135,000 per month over the past three months.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains
low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Wage growth has continued to moderate
while still outpacing inflation.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the
labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.</span> <small>(0.412)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor
market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median projection for the
unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and next, a bit higher than
projected in March.</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat
elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Estimates based on the consumer price index
and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May
and that—excluding the volatile food and energy categories—core PCE prices rose
2.6 percent.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as
reflected in both market- and survey-based measures.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Respondents to surveys of consumers,
businesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Beyond the next
year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our
2 percent inflation goal.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation this year is—is
3 percent, somewhat higher than projected in March.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median inflation projection falls to
2.4 percent in 2026 and 2.1 percent in 2027.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At today’s meeting, the Committee
decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to
continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to determine the appropriate
Page 2 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of
risks.</span> <small>(0.804)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies continue to evolve, and
their effects on the economy remain uncertain.</span> <small>(0.775)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The effects of tariffs will depend, among other
things, on their ultimate level.</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic
effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined.</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Even so, increases in tariffs this year
are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time shift in the price
level.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Avoiding
that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass
through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well
anchored.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent
a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As we act to
meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,
keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor
market conditions that benefit all Americans.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are
in tension.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and
the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to
close.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of
the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.</span> <small>(0.769)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 3 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most
likely scenario going forward.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median projection projects—participant—median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this
year, the same as projected in March.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The median projection declines to 3.6 percent at the end of
next year and to 3.4 percent at the end of 2027, a little higher than the March projection.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">These
individual forecasts are always subject to uncertainty, and, as I have noted, uncertainty is
unusually elevated.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or decision.</span> <small>(0.620)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">At this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review
of our monetary policy framework.</span> <small>(0.744)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We focused on issues related to assessing the risks and
uncertainties that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implications for policy
strategy and communications.</span> <small>(0.849)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide
range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference that
we held last month.</span> <small>(0.806)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board
lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.</span> <small>(0.718)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We intend to wrap up any
modifications to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy by late
summer.</span> <small>(0.808)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">After that, we will consider enhancements to our suite of communications tools,
including the SEP.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and
stable prices.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation
sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.</span> <small>(0.783)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We understand that our
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in

service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the New York Times.</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">To what extent
has the more limited impact from tariffs at this stage on inflation changed your view on what the
ultimate economic fallout will be from these policies and the timing of when they will
materialize in the data?</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ve had three months of, of favorable inflation readings since
the high readings of January and February, and that’s, of course, highly welcome news.</span> <small>(0.754)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Part of
that just is that services, core services—both housing services and nonhousing services have
really been grinding down toward levels that are—that are consistent with 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s the good news.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course, we
expect—as you—as you point out, we, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the
summer.</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the
end consumer.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A good example of that would be, goods being sold at retailers today may have been
imported several months ago—before tariffs were imposed—so we’re beginning to see some
effects.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we do expect to see more of them over coming months.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We do—we do also see
price increases in some of the relevant categories like personal computers and audio-visual
equipment—things like that that are attributable to tariff increases.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, we look at
surveys of businesses, and there, there are many of those.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you, you do see a range of
things, but, but many, many companies do expect to—to, to put all or—some or all of the effect
Page 5 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of tariffs through to the next, next person in the—in the chain and, ultimately, to the consumer.</span> <small>(0.674)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today—you know, the amount of these—the, the amount of the tariff effects, the size of the
tariff effects, their duration, and the time it will take are all highly uncertain.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, that is why
we think the appropriate thing to do is to hold where we are as we learn more, and we think our
policy stance is, is in a good place—where we’re well positioned to react to incoming
developments.</span> <small>(0.687)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So in terms of how we should interpret the rate cuts penciled into the
SEP, is this reflecting that there’s this expectation that underlying inflation will just stay well
enough contained that allows the Committee to eventually move ahead with those cuts?</span> <small>(0.364)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Or is it
about, you know, responding to a deterioration in economic activity, let’s say?</span> <small>(0.649)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, how
should we make sense of the forecast?</span> <small>(0.735)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if you look at the forecast, you will see that people do generally
expect inflation to move up and then to come back down.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we can’t just assume that.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Of
course, we don’t know that, and, you know, our, our job is to make sure—one of our jobs—to
make sure that a one-time increase in inflation doesn’t turn into an inflation problem.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And that,
again—that will depend on the size of the effects, how long it takes for them to come in, and,
and, ultimately, on, on keeping inflation expectations anchored.</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, and thanks, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with
Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at the, the rate path starting in December to today and adjust it over the full
time horizon you’ve got there, you’ve taken about ¼ point per year out of your projected path.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you end at a higher rate in end-2027 than you were—would have in the prior forecast.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is
that a result of, of a sense that tariffs will lead to more persistent inflation?</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it a result of
Page 6 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
reassessments of where your short-term neutral rate is?</span> <small>(0.759)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it—why, why are you on a slower
path now?</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would focus most on the—on the nearer term.</span> <small>(0.638)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you think—as
you get out to the—to the later years, it’s hard to—it’s hard for anybody to know where the
economy is going.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You didn’t see people moving their longer-term, you know, estimate of the
neutral rate, for example, at this meeting.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and those things are probably slow moving.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I
think—I think if you look at what’s happening here since March—this is since March, right?—</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">you see a little slower growth, just a tiny tick up, one-tenth tick up, in, in unemployment, and
you see inflation moving up three-tenths.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And by the way, it was—it was a similar move from
the December SEP to the March.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s what you see.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You see the, the effects of tariffs.</span> <small>(0.747)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
think we learned in April, after the March meeting, that substantially higher tariffs were likely,
and then since then, the estimates of where the tariffs will be have actually moved back down,
although still at an elevated level.</span> <small>(0.339)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re adapting in real time, and what you see is, you
know, an, an accumulation of individual assessments.</span> <small>(0.712)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Okay, but you say in the statement that risks have diminished
on that front, but the July 9, you know, drop-dead date for all the, the Liberation Day tariffs is
still out there and unresolved.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve got now an exchange of missiles between two Middle
East adversaries, with a possible U.S. involvement—how can you justify saying that risks have
diminished?</span> <small>(0.827)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what we said was that uncertainty has, has—uncertainty about the
economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many, many surveys say that.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They do.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—and, and, that’s—that’s actually a line from the Tealbook, which you can see in five years.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Remember to check that. [</span> <small>(0.768)</small></p>

CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.716)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No—but if you think of that, tariff uncertainty—uncertainty really
peaked in April and since then has come down.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s—that’s really what that’s just
acknowledging.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">It’s diminished but still elevated—that it’s uncertainty.</span> <small>(0.373)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think that’s an
accurate statement.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There is
an argument out there in favor of cutting rates more immediately.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has continued to cool
and is back at roughly 2 percent, despite the tariffs.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I guess I also wanted to ask about, you
know, cracks in the job market, with gross hiring slowing—concentrated in just a few industries.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve seen some housing data, including this morning, that have been pretty weak.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Do you see
any concerns that, you know, the economy is weakening and that is a reason to cut rates going
forward?</span> <small>(0.385)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we do—we do, of course, monitor all those things.</span> <small>(0.692)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, I think if
you look at the overall picture, you know, what you’re seeing is 4.2 percent unemployment and
an economy that’s growing at a—at a rate hard to know, given the, the unusual flows in the first
quarter.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it appears to be 1½, 2 percent—maybe a little better than that.</span> <small>(0.516)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sentiment has come
up off of its very low levels.</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s still—it’s still depressed.</span> <small>(0.407)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, you can—you can
point to things—the housing market is a longer-run problem and also a short-run problem.</span> <small>(0.749)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
don’t think it’s indicative of—you know, basically, the situation is, we have a longer-run
shortage of housing, and we also have high rates right now.</span> <small>(0.763)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think the best thing we can do for
the housing market is to restore price stability in a sustainable way and, and create a strong labor
market, and that’s the best thing we can do for the housing market.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You asked about the job

market—again, look at labor force participation.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look at wages.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Look at job creation.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re
all at healthy levels now.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I, I would say you can see perhaps a very, very slow continued
cooling, but nothing that’s troubling at this time.</span> <small>(0.357)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we watch it—we watch it very,
very carefully.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, overall, again, the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well
positioned to respond in a timely way to economic developments, and—for now—and we’ll be
watching the data carefully.</span> <small>(0.760)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Well, just quickly on—given that, you know, there are
concerns inflation will rise—but there is the alternate scenario that tariffs would create demand
destruction and slow growth sufficiently and that would perhaps keep a bit of a lid on inflation.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Do you see odds of that scenario, what kind of odds do you see of that scenario coming true, and
how many months of cool inflation would you need to see before concluding that maybe that
lower-inflation scenario is taking place?</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is very much the conversation we had today and yesterday.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There, there are many, many different scenarios—many combinations of scenarios where
inflation does or doesn’t prove out to be at the levels we think and where the labor market does
or doesn’t soften.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think what, what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of
very high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No one holds
these, these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they’re all
going to be data dependent.</span> <small>(0.672)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that—you can make a case for, for any of the rate paths, I
think, that you see in, in the SEP.</span> <small>(0.679)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we do this once a quarter.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—it’s a hard
thing to do at this—particularly at this time.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">But it does reflect—you know, if you see somebody
writing down, you know, a, a rate path that involves cuts, that’s them saying, “Yes, I think we
will get to a place, more likely than not, where cuts will be appropriate.”</span> <small>(0.366)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it could be—it
Page 9 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
could be a joint probability of a number of possible outcomes.</span> <small>(0.726)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Again, remember how much
uncertainty we face, though.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chair, I wonder if you could describe for us some
of those scenarios.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do you get to a place—I’m noticing that the uncertainty levels in your
forecast are very high.</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">How do you get to a place where you have the confidence in the outlook
for—say, inflation and/or growth or the unemployment rate—how many months does it take, and
what do you want to see in the data to get to that level of confidence to actually reduce rates off
the restrictive level?</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s—it’s—again, it’s very, very hard to say when that will
happen.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that the time will come; it come—could come quickly.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could not come
quickly.</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">As long as the economy is solid, though—as long as we’re seeing the kind of labor
market that we have and reasonably decent growth and inflation moving down, we feel like the
right thing to do is to be where we are, with where our policy stance is, and just learn more.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
in particular, we feel like we’re going to learn a great deal more over the summer on tariffs.</span> <small>(0.736)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
do—we hadn’t expected them to show up much by now, and they haven’t, and we will see
whether—the extent to which they do over, over coming months.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think that’s going to
inform our thinking, for one thing.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, we’ll see how the labor market progresses.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So,
at some point, it will become clear.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I can’t tell you exactly when that will be.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know,
meanwhile, we’ll be watching, watching the labor market very carefully for signs of weakness
and strength and tariffs for signs of, of what’s going to happen there.</span> <small>(0.397)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, there are
many developments ahead, you know, even in the near term—developments are expected on
tariffs.</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we, we don’t yet know with any confidence where they will settle out.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
Page 10 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
have an estimate, and it’s a pretty—I think all estimates are now pretty close together.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s—
it’s, yeah, highly uncertain.</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When you say “estimate”—estimate of the impact of tariffs on the
core PCE—is that what it is?</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And can you share that?</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, what you start with is, is—what’s the effective tariff rate
overall?</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And people are managing to that.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, the, the pass-through of tariffs to
consumer price inflation is a whole process that’s very uncertain.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, as you know, there
are many parties in that chain: There’s the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer,
and the consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to, to pay for the
tariff.</span> <small>(0.617)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But together, they will all pay for it together—or maybe one party will pay it all.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that
process is very hard to predict, and we haven’t been through a situation like this, and I think we
have to be humble about our ability to forecast it.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s why we need to see some actual data
to have—to make better decisions.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we’d like to get some, some more data, and, and, again,
in the meantime, we can do that because the economy remains in solid condition.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell, I guess I’m
wondering if you could explain a little more the divergence we see in the dot plot, particularly
around the 2025 rate projections.</span> <small>(0.655)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I realize this is—you know, you have one group of officials
that are putting down no cuts, another that are putting down more than one—and recognizing
that could be difficult to summarize, but is it a matter of people having a different outlook or a
different reaction function?</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">A different commitment to defending against another inflation
mistake?</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How, how did that play out over the last two days?</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 11 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.717)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right, we—and, as is often the case, we have a pretty
healthy diversity of views on the Committee.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We did have strong support for today’s decision
and broad agreement that our policy stance does leave us in a good place.</span> <small>(0.635)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would point to
two factors, and you mentioned them.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The first is just that parties have a diversity of forecasts,
and, and they do align with, with where—with where their dots are.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So if you have a higher
inflation forecast, you’re going to be less likely to be writing down, you know, more, more cuts.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But as—remember, as we see more data, we’re going to learn more about where inflation is
headed.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that means when it is time to look at, at normal—at sort of, at, you know—
resuming our normalization process, the differences you may—you see should be smaller
because we’ll have seen actual data.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Right now, it’s just a forecast in a very foggy time.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s the first part—is forecast.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Secondly, people can look at the same data, and they can evaluate the risks differently, as
you know.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And that includes, you know, the, the risk of higher inflation, the risk it’ll be more
persistent, the risk that the labor market will weaken—people are going to have different
assessments of that risk.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you put that in there, too.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So those are the two ways that, that—the
two things, I think, that drive these things.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Remember, though, with—as I mentioned earlier—
with uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with a lot of conviction.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
that’s really where it is.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a function of those things, and I think as the data come in, you
should see those differences diminish.</span> <small>(0.723)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If I could follow up—you’ve said the policy is in a good place, and
that it’s modestly restrictive.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given all the uncertainty—you just talked about tariff levels,
uncertainty around the pass-through—is it price increases versus margin compression?—some of
Page 12 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the softness that Chris talked about in, in labor and housing.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why wouldn’t it be better to have
rates at a more neutral setting as the economy heads into this period of very high uncertainty?</span> <small>(0.702)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So if you just look backward at the data, that, that’s what you would
say, but that’s not—we have to be forward looking.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And the thing that every forecaster—every
outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to
arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think a backward-looking
look would, would lead you to a neutral stance.</span> <small>(0.606)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we, we can’t—we have to—we have to look
at that.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what’s going
to happen.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It, it’s, you know, the—there’s a range of possibilities on how, how large the, the
inflation effects and the other effects are going to be.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’ll make smarter and better decisions
if we just wait a couple of months or however long it takes to get a sense of, of really what, what
is going to be the pass-through of inflation and what’re—what’s going to be the effects on
spending and on hiring and all those things.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I’m
wondering, given now that the Supreme Court has maybe carved out the Fed from some of the
legal implications of that, whether this is just noise that the markets and everybody should ignore

Wall Street—on consumers—about the outlook for the economy.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Okay, from my standpoint, it’s—it’s not complicated.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Ah, ah, immigration—so you’re asking immigration?</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, you know—I, I wouldn’t want to speculate.</span> <small>(0.549)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What—one way
to get at that from an economic standpoint—we, of course, don’t comment on immigration
policy.</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not ours to make or comment on.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But what you see is a—an, an unemployment rate
that has been really solid and at a low level—not really increasing.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s been in a—in a good
range and well within the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">And that
means, like, part of that is that labor demand and labor supply are kind of moving down at the
same rate.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Labor demand is, is softening—you see that in job creation—but it’s still kind of at a
healthy level.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And labor supply is, is diminishing because the, the immigration numbers that we

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So the—those two factors, supply and demand—that’s

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the framework review really has two tracks, right?</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The first track
is our—is our policy framework.</span> <small>(0.765)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that is reflected in the consensus statement.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we,
we’ve said that we would finish that and announce it by the end of the summer.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re well
along in that process.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve had the meetings that we need to have, and we’re now going to be
going into [cough]—pardon me—into discussions about, you know, specific changes to
language.</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s—that’s the framework part of it.</span> <small>(0.594)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The second part of it is our
communications tools and practices [cough]—pardon me—and that, that part comes next, okay?</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what we’re going to do in the meetings this fall.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Actually, what we did at this meeting,
though, is we, we sort of prepared the ground for that.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We had a—we had a meeting where we
talked at a high level about a number of ideas.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The SEP is part of it—you know, other—many, many other ideas.</span> <small>(0.711)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—it’s sort of—
how do we think our communications can be improved?</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There are a number of ideas.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People
offered a really—it was a great conversation.</span> <small>(0.624)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Number of ideas—but we’re—we’re going to look
at those with staff briefing and a lot of thought in the fall.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I would say, when it comes to
changing communications, you know, I would only do—I would only support things really that
only—implement things that have very broad support.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And also, you want to be really careful,
because I think our communications are pretty well received.</span> <small>(0.503)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re not broken, so more is not

necessarily better—but better is better.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re going to be looking at ways to do—to do things
that will improve the clarity of what we do for the benefit of, of the public.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Kelly.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">KELLY O’GRADY.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Kelly O’Grady, CBS News.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re
famously known as the guy that makes decision based on data instead of speculation.</span> <small>(0.656)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">You’ve
said today in—the inflation data is in a good place—we don’t know how tariffs are going to
impact prices going forward—that’s uncertain.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I’ve got to go back to the last time that you
cut rates in December, and there was still the what-if of tariffs.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So what made you feel
comfortable cutting then, when inflation was higher than where it is today—and you didn’t cut
today?</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Well, the, the forecast for inflation in December was 2½ core PCE
for 2025—the forecast was 2½ percent—which is a good inflation forecast.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think what we’ve
learned is that—and this was long before we had any idea of what the actual policies would be.</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We’ve learned the tariffs are going to be substantially larger than, than forecasters generally
thought.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, we, we don’t—our, our forecasts are generally not particularly
different from those of other, you know, well-resourced forecasting operations.</span> <small>(0.626)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So what we
learned—and particularly in April—was that substantially larger tariffs were coming and that
that would mean higher inflation.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s what happened.</span> <small>(0.380)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so you—now you see—you saw
2½ percent forecast in December.</span> <small>(0.447)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You saw 2.8 percent in March, and you see 3.1 percent now.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s six-tenths higher inflation for 2025, and that’s—that’s a big part of, of the change.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
that’s—that’s due to the effects of, of the tariffs that are—you know, we, we don’t know where
Page 16 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
they’re going to land, but it’s pretty apparent they’re going to land higher than outside
forecasters were really guessing at the end of last year.</span> <small>(0.616)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My follow-up to that—I think consumers—right?—were looking
for relief on rates when it comes to mortgages—car loans.</span> <small>(0.646)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Small businesses want to take out
more manageable loans.</span> <small>(0.734)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">When you look at the cumulative inflation over the past five years,
prices have risen over 20 percent—it’s been a rough road.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So what is the tipping point, then, for
the wait-and-see approach in terms of how much it’s going to help versus when it hurts the
American consumer?</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Well, I mean, we’re trying to restore price—the best thing we can do
for the—for the public that we serve is restore price stability.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">If we can, and we will, restore
price stability, meaning 2 percent inflation on a durable, sustainable basis—that and also
maximum employment—and if we, we restore those things, that’s the best thing.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that is our
goal.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The best thing we can do for the American people—for, for households and businesses—
that is the ultimate thing that we can deliver.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And they can make their decisions without having
to think about inflation all the time.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, in the meantime, we have to keep rates high to keep—to
get inflation all the way down.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re not very high—let’s be honest.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I would say policy is
modestly or moderately—probably modestly now—restrictive.</span> <small>(0.379)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you look at the economy, it’s
not performing as though it were performing under very strict monetary policy—very restrictive
monetary policy.</span> <small>(0.788)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I would say probably modestly restrictive—and so what it will take is, is
confidence that inflation is coming down.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now, I would say, without tariffs, that confidence would be building because if you—if
you see what’s happening with nonhousing services and housing services, which are the other
two big pieces other than goods, those are coming down really nicely now.</span> <small>(0.527)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think we have to
Page 17 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
learn a little more about, about tariffs.</span> <small>(0.698)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t know—I don’t know what the right way for us to
react will be.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think it’s hard to know with, with any confidence how we should react until we
see, really, the size of the effects—then we can start to make a better judgment.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So that’s what
we’re doing, and I think we can—we can take the time to do that, because unemployment is
4.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Wages are moving up.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Real wages are moving up at a—at a healthy clip now.</span> <small>(0.501)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
inflation is, you know—2.3 percent headline inflation over a 12-month basis.</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s a good
economy, and a solid economy with decent growth.</span> <small>(0.614)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re saying that uncertainty
has come down, the economy is moving at a solid pace, inflation has come down over the past
three months, and this is all moving in the right direction.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So are you indicating here that
Americans should expect some sort of economic pain in the second half of the year?</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’m not—I’m not saying that at all.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, from our standpoint,
what I can say is that the, the U.S. economy is in solid shape.</span> <small>(0.615)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Inflation has come down.</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The
unemployment rate remains at 4.2 percent.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I mentioned, real wages are moving up.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a—
it’s a good—job creation is at a healthy level.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Unemployment, again, as I said, low—labor force
participation at a good place.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What we’re waiting for to reduce rates is, is to understand what
will happen with, with, really, the tariff inflation.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there’s a lot of uncertainty about that.</span> <small>(0.713)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Every forecaster you can name who, you know—who is a professional, you know, forecaster
with, with adequate resources and forecasts for a living is forecasting, you know, a pretty
significant—everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming
months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it will be someone in that
chain that I mentioned: Between the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer—
Page 18 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
ultimately, somebody putting it into a, a good of some kind or just the consumer buying it—and,
you know, all through that, that chain, people will be trying not to be the ones who, who pick up
the cost.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid.</span> <small>(0.572)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And some of it will fall on the end
consumer.</span> <small>(0.419)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We know that because that’s what businesses say—that’s what the, the data say from
past—so we know that’s coming.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we just want to see, see a little bit of that before we make
judgments prematurely.</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And follow-up on that—so you’ve spent years, though,
talking about how, how you’re data dependent, and be a little more direct on this.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
now you’re making decisions looking forward—doesn’t the data you’re seeing today indicate
there should be a rate cut?</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, I mean, you’re—monetary policy has to be forward looking.</span> <small>(0.785)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is elementary.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve got to be looking—I always—we always talk about the incoming
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We say that over and over and over again,
right?</span> <small>(0.550)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s always forward looking.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, if you know—at the very beginning of the
pandemic, you know, we cut rates to zero immediately.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nothing had happened.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We just knew
that it was going to be really bad, right?</span> <small>(0.394)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we took very aggressive forward looking—because
we knew things were going to be unusually difficult.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, of course, this, this is something we,
we sort of know is coming—we just don’t know the size of it.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, the economy seems to
be in solid shape.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the labor market’s not crying out for a rate cut.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Businesses, you know,
were in a bit of shock after April 2.</span> <small>(0.839)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you see business sentiment—you talk to business people
now—there’s a very different feeling now that people are working their way through this.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And
they, they understand how they’re going to go, and it’s—it, it feels much more positive and
Page 19 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
constructive than it did three months ago, let’s say.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, again, we think that our current stance of
monetary policy is in a good place.</span> <small>(0.816)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Amara.</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">AMARA OMEOKWE.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.</span> <small>(0.641)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair Powell,
in February, you told Congress that the Fed is “overworked, maybe, not overstaffed.”</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Then, in a
memo to—a memo to staff in May announcing a deferred resignation program at the Fed, you
said you wanted to ensure that the Fed was “right-sized.”</span> <small>(0.673)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those two statements appear to be at
odds with one another.</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could you explain what changed in the roughly three months between
those statements that made you decide that staff levels at the Fed should decline?</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I don’t see them at all as, as in tension.</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, so I was asked,
“Is the Fed overstaffed?”</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I said, “No.”</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, and I sort of said as a pun,
“Overworked, but not overstaffed.”</span> <small>(0.518)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">People do work extremely hard at the Fed, and I know they
work hard at Bloomberg, too. [</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Laughter] So—but we do.</span> <small>(0.483)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We work hard.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I would say
this—so we are careful stewards of public resources, and sometimes you need to show that.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
there’ve been several times in our history—modern history—where the Fed has said, “You know
what?</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to do a buyout.</span> <small>(0.526)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to—going to show the public.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to
demonstrate that we are good stewards of public resources.”</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we thought—and I, I thought—
that this is a time when we can.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ve—we grow about—our headcount has grown
at about 1 percent a year.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So over the course of a couple of years, we’re going to—we’re doing a
careful scrub of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks, and we’re going to find 10 percent of
employees who can do something else.</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Where, where we can—we can streamline our operations—and we, we think we can get
there in a year, in a couple of years.</span> <small>(0.624)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We think we can do that.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we think the—we think the,
Page 20 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the—this is, this is without taking risk to carrying out our critical missions.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is something
you do very carefully—thoughtfully.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you do it, again, respecting that we have critical
missions to carry out.</span> <small>(0.605)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve had experience—a lot of experience—in my prior careers, you know,
with headcount reductions and things like that, and this is how you do it professionally.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You do
it carefully—thoughtfully—with a lot of planning, and you do it over a period of time.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I
think it’s—I think the Fed will be fine.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think no one will notice any decline in our ability to
carry out our missions, and I think it’s just us wanting to demonstrate to the public that we are
actually good stewards of their—of their resources.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re—we’re effectively wiping out
10 years of headcount growth with this.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, I mean, we just—we wanted to show that, you
know—that we’re good stewards.</span> <small>(0.393)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How is progress on reducing the headcount going so far?</span> <small>(0.641)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are
you on track to meet the goal?</span> <small>(0.608)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re just at the very beginning.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you know, we’re doing a
buyout program.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re going to—we’re going to hit that goal.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think many organizations find
that they can—that they can do this.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You don’t want to do it every year or anything, but you can
do it at intervals.</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you, you wind up not, you know—not interfering with your ability to
perform your jobs.</span> <small>(0.627)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As you’re no
doubt aware, the Senate Finance Committee has tabled its version of the reconciliation bill this
week, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the tenor of the debate at the
FOMC over the past few days on fiscal policy and the degree to which that influenced people’s
projections for 2026 and beyond.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, so, you know, we don’t—we don’t sit around and debate or
really discuss—we, we take fiscal policy as fully exogenous.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so we, we actually, you know,
really didn’t talk about, about the bill or the contents of it.</span> <small>(0.688)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s still evolving.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, when,
when it gets close—closer—remember also we have a very, very large economy, and that the
effects will be at the margin.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, I, I expect that they’ll—they may already be in—
but they will be in by the next meeting.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll make an estimate.</span> <small>(0.524)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s not a major thing; it’s
nothing that we discuss.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It, it may have been mentioned a couple of times—but as something
that’s coming in.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think the outcome is—you know, we don’t know the outcome yet

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The point, really, is that we are starting to see, you know, layoffs.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and important gatherers

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It helps.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>

helps the executive branch.</span> <small>(0.654)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">More importantly, really, it helps businesses.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They need to know
what’s going on in the economy.</span> <small>(0.755)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The United States has been a leader for many, many years in
this whole project of measuring and understanding what’s happening in, in our very large and
dynamic economy.</span> <small>(0.763)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I hate to see—I hate to see us cutting back on that because it, it is a real benefit to
the general public that people in all kinds of jobs have the best possible understanding of what’s
happening in the economy and, and, hence, what’s likely to happen.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s very hard to measure

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re conducting this
monetary policy strategy framework review, but next year we’re supposed to have a new Fed
Chair, and I’m wondering if that affects at all the way that you’re approaching this.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How do you
ensure that this framework will actually be durable?</span> <small>(0.487)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, the framework goes back to—the framework document
goes back to 2012, and it’s—it’s the Committee’s document.</span> <small>(0.658)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not like we’re going to invent a
brand new way to do things.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—it’s been an evolving document, so it shouldn’t depend on
who the Chair is at all.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It should depend on what’s happening in the economy and what the
Committee wants to do.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, yeah, it isn’t really tied to any particular Chair, and, you know, we
used to renew it every year.</span> <small>(0.591)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now we do it every five years.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—but I, I don’t think anybody—
I’ve never heard anyone raise this issue that, you know, a new Chair might want to come in and

go in a completely different direction.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I really—I really don’t think that’s right.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know,
that’s not—not going to be up to me to decide.</span> <small>(0.362)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that affecting at all that you’re—who you’re consulting with—

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, not at all.</span> <small>(0.525)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MATT EGAN.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Matt Egan from CNN.</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Relatively low gas
prices this year have helped drive down inflation in recent reports, but that trend is starting to
reverse, given the crisis in the Middle East.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How are you thinking about how the Israel–Iran
conflict will impact the economy, especially inflation, and what lessons were learned during the
2022 period when another conflict, the Russia–Ukraine war, sent oil and gas prices
skyrocketing?</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, of course, we’re watching—like everybody else is—what’s going
on.</span> <small>(0.601)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I really don’t have any comment on that.</span> <small>(0.553)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, possible that, that we’ll see higher
energy prices—what’s tended to happen is, when there’s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see
a spike in energy prices—but tends to come down.</span> <small>(0.476)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those things don’t generally tend to have
lasting effects on inflation, although, of course, in the 1970s, they famously did, because you had
a series of very, very large shocks.</span> <small>(0.830)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we haven’t seen anything like that—that—like that now.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The U.S. economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s.</span> <small>(0.763)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, but—
MATT EGAN.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A quick follow-up—I’ve just got to ask you about artificial intelligence.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Some technology executives have recently been warning that AI could wipe out a large chunk of
entry-level jobs and significantly increase the unemployment rate.</span> <small>(0.383)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I’m wondering how
concerned you are, if at all, about the threat that AI poses to employment.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.719)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So this is the question.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question really is, will AI be more
augmenting labor or replacing labor?</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I wouldn’t—I, I—we all see those announcements,
including one today.</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t overread a, a couple of data points, because, you know, AI
should be creating jobs at the same time.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It may be replacing—it may be doing both.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Anyone
who’s done any work with it—with AI—will, will have been a little bit stunned at how capable it
is.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s just a different thing.</span> <small>(0.600)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think this is something that certainly has transformational
potential—and probably we’re in the very early stages of it.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They say what you’re seeing now
compared to what you’ll see in two years is, is going to be very different and even more
effective.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think it’s really hard to know.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, of course, there are optimists who feel
like it’s going to make everybody much more, you know—much more productive.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And there are
those who think it’s going to replace an awful lot of jobs right across the income spectrum—you
know, white collar, blue collar, and everything.</span> <small>(0.568)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I just don’t know.</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t—we don’t have
a “house view” on that.</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But this is—this is going to be a very important question for some time.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GREG ROBB.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I was wondering if you
could step back a little bit, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, there’s a spate of articles and a lot of op-
eds now in the newspapers saying that the U.S. economy and the global economy is going
through this profound change, you know, akin to the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s.</span> <small>(0.792)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And don’t you owe the American people, like, some sort of, like, explanation for what we’re
going through?</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, I, I noticed earlier this month when you, you talked about Bretton
Woods a little bit, and you said that Bretton Woods—the Fed staff had to, like, change how
they’ve—the dollar—movements of the dollar was impacting the economy.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are we going
Page 25 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
through something like that now—that, you know—are you having to change how you do
monetary policy?</span> <small>(0.739)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it—is it that fundamental of a change under way?</span> <small>(0.665)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s—it’s certainly a time of real change—you know, from a
geopolitical standpoint, from a trade standpoint, from an immigration standpoint—you see this
not just here, but everywhere.</span> <small>(0.764)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there’s—there’s quite a lot going on.</span> <small>(0.614)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It doesn’t change the
way we do monetary policy in the near term.</span> <small>(0.774)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, but—and it doesn’t change our objectives
or what we need to do.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, these, these things are not really our issues—they’re
really issues for elected governments.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">All of those issues are really for elected governments.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But there’s no question it’s a time of, of real, real change—and very hard to see where that goes.</span> <small>(0.619)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Will it be—there have been many, many things written about how it’s going to be a more
inflationary time.</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s possible; it’s not guaranteed.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, AI could cut in a very other
direction.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">AI could make people much more productive and—and push in the other direction.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
don’t know, though.</span> <small>(0.565)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you’re right, but, honestly, our focus is, is a much more practical one,
and that is, how do we keep inflation low and, and employment high in the near term?</span> <small>(0.429)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s
really what we’re about.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mark Hamrick.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MARK HAMRICK.</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hello, Chairman Powell.</span> <small>(0.701)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mark Hamrick with
Bankrate.</span> <small>(0.743)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What is the view about the growing amount of slack in the job market, including the
softening in payrolls, the forecast of a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and the ability of
workers to demand wage hikes or not in this environment where you have inflation surging?</span> <small>(0.364)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I don’t, you don’t see—you don’t really see unemployment going up.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You don’t see increased slack, really—I mean, at the margin.</span> <small>(0.361)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Remember, you’re at 4.2 percent
unemployment.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That, that was for many, many years—that was an extremely low level.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It
Page 26 of 28

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
happens to have come up off of an even lower level.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As we came out of the pandemic, we were
as low as 3.4 percent.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But 4.2 percent is probably at the low end of estimates of the longer-run,
you know, sustainable level of natural rate of unemployment.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I wouldn’t—I guess I wouldn’t
agree with that.</span> <small>(0.471)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And also, in terms of wages—you know, real wages after inflation have been
moving up sort of more than was consistent with 2 percent inflation.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re still moving up at
a—at a healthy clip—and I think much more consistent with 2 percent inflation, given, given a, a
reasonable assessment of, of trend productivity.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s a pretty good labor market.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
you’re right that the level of job creation has come down, but so has the supply of workers—the
change in the supply—the, the new supply.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So you’ve seen—you’ve seen the unemployment rate remain pretty stable at 4.2.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s
been as high as 4.3, but, you know, those are—those are good numbers.</span> <small>(0.670)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s a pretty good
labor market.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s—the thing is, there’s—a more concerning thing is, there’s not—there are
not a lot of layoffs, but there are not a lot of, of job creation.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The number—if you’re out of
work, it’s—it’s hard to find a job.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But very few people are being laid off at this point.</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So
that’s—an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully, because if there were to be, you know,
significant layoffs and the job-finding rate were to remain this low, you would have a lot—you
would have an increase in unemployment fairly quickly.</span> <small>(0.578)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that hasn’t happened.</span> <small>(0.369)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It really
hasn’t happened.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re—so the U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to, to
weaken, really, over the last three years, and it’s been remarkable to see—just again and again
when people think it’s going to weaken out.</span> <small>(0.445)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Eventually it will, but we don’t see signs of
that now.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Go to Jean for the last question.</span> <small>(0.633)</small></p>

June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEAN YUNG.</span> <small>(0.727)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s been a lot
of talk about cuts.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wanted to ask you—why do you think there are no forecasts for rates to rise
or, or even to stay where they are next year, given that the projection for inflation is to rise to
3 percent and there’s a lot of—there’s some skepticism over whether those price hikes will be a
one-time event?</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So there are a number of people on the Committee who wrote down
no cuts this year but some cuts next year.</span> <small>(0.375)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, look, I think, you know, people are writing down
their most likely path, right?</span> <small>(0.520)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re not saying there’s zero possibility of other things, really.</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Really, it’s—think of it as the least unlikely path in a situation like this where uncertainty is very
high.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I think—again, people write—they write down their, their rate paths, and they do not
have, like, a really high conviction that this is exactly what’s going to happen over the next two
years.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No one feels that way about their rate path.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They feel like, “What am I going to write
down?”</span> <small>(0.500)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, what would you write down?</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not easy to, to be—to do that with
confidence.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I would just say it that way.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t rule things in or out—certainly, a hike is not
the base case at all.</span> <small>(0.668)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not something people are writing down.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, in the meantime, we do the
best we can with these forecasts, and I, I think they’re—they’re representative of, you know, of
the different forecasts and different reaction functions that people on the Committee have.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So thank you very much.</span> <small>(0.422)</small></p>
