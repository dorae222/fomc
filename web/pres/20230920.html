Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 20, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon, everyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely
focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the
American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain
strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Looking ahead, we’re in a position
to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be
appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and
the evolving outlook and risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and,
so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Recent readings on
consumer spending have been particularly robust.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Activity in the housing sector has picked up
somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage
rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In our
Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments
Page 1 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Participants expect growth
to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The unemployment rate
ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has moved
up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward
pressures on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from
3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Based on the consumer
price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the
12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core
PCE prices rose 3.9 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,
and longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad
range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
has a long way to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this
year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure
on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from
tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In light of how far we have come in
tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the
federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our
securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>In our SEP,
FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the
federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most
likely scenario going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this
year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Compared with our June
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year
but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>These projections, of
course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the
path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability
goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the
Page 3 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well
as the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the
incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Real interest rates now are well above
mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties
in precisely gauging the stance of policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,
and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving
down sustainably toward our objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price
stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over
the longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What makes the
Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive,
Page 4 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s noted uncertainty about policy lags.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Headwinds have emerged from the looming
government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt
payments—things of that nature.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit
differently.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at
5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we say we’re
committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive
to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But the fact that we decided to
maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have
not at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you looked at
the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants
believe that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates
one more time in the two remaining meetings this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Others believe that we have already
reached that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by
deciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, right now, it’s still an open question about “sufficiently
restrictive”—you’re not saying today that we’ve reached this level?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we
decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to see convincing
evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—
we’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, you know, we need to see more
progress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And just on the 2024 projections—what’s behind that shallower path
for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real
interest rates are, are positive now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We
need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we need—
we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, you know—
remember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a
plan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a cumulation of individual
forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I wouldn’t want to,
you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But what it reflects, though, is that
economic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be
appropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our
inflation goal, as you see in the SEP.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Rachel.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding
steady?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Could
you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our
current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But this,
of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you’ve got—you
have some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between
Page 6 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now and the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next
two meetings that we have between the end of the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it wasn’t like we were arguing over
that—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see
how the data come in.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
want to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last
three months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We want to see, you
know—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good
example of what we do—of what we do want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was a combination of, of, you know,
of—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So those are
the two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that
we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be
careful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that
the data, you know, support that conclusion.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and
how quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we
assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting
by meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, in your view, what would—I know nothing has been
decided yet—but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to
inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out
for us?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one
way or the other won’t matter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a
pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always
Page 7 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to be learning from data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ve learned all through the course of the last year
that, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you go back a year—and what we
thought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we, we don’t really
know until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A
year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now—now we’re fairly close, we think,
to where we need to get.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t
attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Nonetheless, you know, we
need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you
know, we’ve been moving toward it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at
which we’ve moved.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think that was appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And now that we’re getting closer, we, we—
again, we have the ability to proceed carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve Liesman, CNBC.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby’s
question here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What is it saying about the Committee’s view of the inflation dynamic in the
economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a
point of the funds rate on it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Does it tell you that—does it tell us that the Committee believes
inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine, effectively?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I guess a related
question is, if you’re going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a
row, at what point do we start to think, “Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually
higher”?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense
of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen
Page 8 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that’s something
that’s appeared in the recent data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s more about stronger economic activity, I would say.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to
attribute one explanation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates—
we have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
terms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We only
know it by its works, really.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we
use, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you
know, there are lags here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has
risen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising
their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher
than, than the longer-run rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run
rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is
higher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more
resilient than, than expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’ve said
several times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation
consistently back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit—1.5 percent is just a
touch below what’s the estimate of potential.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So the fact that you’re getting so much done at so
much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how
Page 9 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction
that’s necessary to achieve this?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yes, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now
meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s,
that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and
in the jobs–worker gap.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I would
say, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to
be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so
that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate
comes down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better
balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So all of those things are happening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we
don’t see a big increase in unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is
just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That is not guaranteed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>There, there
may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what
we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So just to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we’ve
gone from a very narrow path to a—to a soft landing to something different.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you call the
soft landing now a baseline expectation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, no—I would not do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I would just say—what, what would
I say about that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that
there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted
off.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Ultimately,
Page 10 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I do
think it’s—I do think it’s possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know—I also think, you know, this is why we’re in
a position to, to move carefully again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>That—we, we will restore price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we know
that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we
have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is
an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t want to handicap
the likelihood of it, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not up to me to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Chair Powell, both you and
Vice Chair Williams have indicated that “sufficiently restrictive” will be judged on a real rather
than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year—provided further
compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the FOMC focused on
targeting a real level of policy restriction?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And can you explain what would constitute enough
evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real
policy settings sufficiently restrictive?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter
and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, I would say, you know—you know
“sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You—it’s not something you can arrive at with
confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so what are we seeing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the
pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing
Page 11 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand—the combination of those two things is
actually working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s principally now in
goods—also in housing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think—we think that that is working.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want
to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think
confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels
like it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that
level—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s a whole other set
of questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s what
we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But it looks like there was—because there was an across-the-board
drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it
seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same
real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you—than you
currently anticipate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and,
certainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the
data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and
the other events that are happening out there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I
can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a
Page 12 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that
would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help
us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Following up on Nick’s question,
actually—John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of,
“Next year, as we see inflation kind of”—again, to Nick’s point—“as, as we see inflation coming
down, we’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we’re not squeezing the
economy harder and harder over time.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I wonder if that’s basically the logic that you
apply—you know, is that how you think about it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then I also wonder—in the last press
conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, “It’s a full year out—those
discussions,” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’t see a possibility of a rate cut in
the first half of next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you
know—how you’re thinking about that timing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals
about, about cutting, I’m never intending to send a signal about timing; I’m just answering them
as, as the question is expressed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry—
the first question was, is that how?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question
we’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about
the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some
point, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Part of that may be that
real rates are rising because inflation is coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the
factors that we see in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 13 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
And you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that
might be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, there’s—you know, there’s so much uncertainty around that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In, in—
when we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No one will look back at this
and say, “Hey, we made a plan.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not like that at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s—this is—these are estimates made
a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that’s how it is.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks so much, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin with Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I wonder—how
do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we’ve been seeing is driven
by excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, relatedly,
if GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own
be a reason to consider more tightening?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very,
very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust
in its—in spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry, your second
question was—
NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Does GDP stays “hot,” but without inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question will be, is, is the
level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get
back to 2 percent inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s going to be the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not—it’s not a question about
GDP on its own.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you
know—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent
Page 14 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
in a sustainable way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we’d be—we’d be
looking at GDP just, just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guido with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are multiple external
factors that are playing out right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We see rising oil prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We see auto workers striking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I was just wondering,
for each of those things, could you talk about how you’re thinking about how that might affect
the course for the Fed and the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it—
you know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments,
higher long-term rates, oil price shock.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you
can—you can look at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and
handicap all of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these
things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the
strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we, we do have to make an
assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so
uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It will depend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve
looked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s really
going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we—and then it also
depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So none of those
things are known right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s very, very hard to know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you just have to leave that
uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and we’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period,
much more about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the same is true for the others.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we—I don’t know if you
Page 15 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
mentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t comment on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It
hasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You know, energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—energy
prices being up can affect spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It can affect the consumer over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A sustained period of
higher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We tend to
look through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>But so the question is,
how long are, are higher prices sustained?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic
effects into account as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those are—those are some of them.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not sure if I hit them all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’re, you’re coming into this with an economy that
appears to have significant momentum.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s, that’s what we start with.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we—but we
do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Craig.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CRAIG TORRES.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I was a little surprised, Chair
Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This economy’s seeing
added supply in a way that could create long-term inflation stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have prime-age labor
force participation moving up where people can add skills.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Workers want to work.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have a
boom in manufacturing construction.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve had a decent spate of homebuilding.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And since
inflation’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All are
which—good for the Fed’s longer-run target of low inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if we lose that in a recession,
aren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So are you taking this into
account as you pursue policy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say
otherwise.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
The, the real point, though, is—the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price
stability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don’t restore price stability, inflation
comes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very
uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It can be a miserable period
to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and
again.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think
now, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move
carefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we fully appreciate that—you know, the
benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market
and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in
unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—
MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of
what some economists are calling “the low-hanging fruit”—such as the unwinding of supply
chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions—or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that
involves most goods and services across the economy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way:
I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we
lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of
these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the
response.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that unwinding was going to be important.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, monetary policy was going
to help.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general,
Page 17 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
better aligning supply with demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So those two forces were always going to be important.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
think it’s very hard to pull them apart.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They work together.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I do think both of them are at
work now, and I think they’re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we—that we are
seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Mike.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In June,
you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you’ve more than
doubled your growth forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, what
would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And given all
the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or
the American people have in your forecasts?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, forecasts are highly uncertain.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Forecasting is very difficult.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But to get to, to your question,
though—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Stronger than expected—and
that’s required higher rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate
unemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in
the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing
significantly higher unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re, we’re continuing that trend.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of inflation,
you, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s only three readings,
you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But if you look
at June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core
inflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in
nonhousing services.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Those are the three buckets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Headline inflation, of course, has come way
Page 18 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think—people
should know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain
forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But these are—these are our forecasts.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, they’re, they’re—we have very
high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other
forecasters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Given the—given the forecast that you have, what justified not
moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming
down?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate
increases that we’ve made.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly,
and we did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary
policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the
risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening
becomes more equal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach
that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that, that’s what we’re doing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So
we’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more
carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need
to get inflation back down to 2 percent.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jennifer Schonberger with
Yahoo Finance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>With your focus on year-over-year PCE, isn’t it true that base effects are huge
and that by the time you meet in November, that it’s more likely that you’ll have a low PCE
number that would make you feel more comfortable?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, secondly, how would the lack of key
Page 19 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
indicators—like CPI, the jobs report—impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to
have a government shutdown?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What was—missed what
factors?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The base factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Base factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So on that, we’re, you know, we’re
looking at just monthly, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase
was from the prior month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base
factors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we can—we can adjust for that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we
don’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It—it’s possible—if, if there is a
government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t—
we wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we
would just have to deal with that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s hard for me to say in advance how that
would affect that meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects
that—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November,
would you feel more comfortable at that point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, yes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how
much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, that’s what we’re looking
at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And month by month, what’s the reading?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I think—I think what we’re
really looking at is, there’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but
they’re incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s why we look at 12-month [rates].</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 20 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
But I think, in this situation—where it looks like we’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in
June—we’re also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months’ inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That—that’s the right way to
go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what
to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can let the data evolve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for the question, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I want to focus back in on oil prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re seeing oil prices, as you
mentioned, move up, and that’s pushing the price of gas.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So how does that factor into your
decision to raise rates or not—because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we’ve
seen, the overall inflation has actually risen?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, you know, energy prices are very important for the
consumer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>This, this can affect consumer spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It, it really
comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The reason why we look
at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how
tight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>However, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high,
that’ll have an effect on spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations
of inflation—things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s just things we have to monitor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the consumer—they’re putting more and more of this on
their credit card.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How long do you
Page 21 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And are you concerned
about a, a debt bubble related to that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to
look through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know,
turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Consumer distress—
measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—
during and after the, the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re now moving back up to normal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re, we’re
watching that carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic
era.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEAN YUNG.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Yields along the Treasury curve
have risen to their highest in years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is the Fed’s view about what’s been driving that
increase in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations—and how
much to technical factors?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, rates have moved up significantly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I
think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition
of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation
expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields—
and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a
very precise answer, but they give you different answers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re
moving up because—it’s not because of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s because probably—it’ll probably have
Page 22 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
something to do with stronger growth, I would say—more, more supply of Treasuries.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You
know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KYLE CAMPBELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kyle Campbell, American Banker.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you for taking the
questions—just two on, on housing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline
and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’s also some questions out
there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which
are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental
market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it’s measured and
felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And then as far as a constrained housing
supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now
than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about
taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over
time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so—and supply is kind of
structurally constrained.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as,
as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re-
leased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A year ago, it would have
been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So as
those leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing
services inflation coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Your second question was the lock-ins.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How much is that
affecting things, really?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 23 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
KYLE CAMPBELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates
down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a
lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea
being that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they
want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly
in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight—
in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No, I, I don’t think it would.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
mean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what,
what rates does the economy need?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic
or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point
that—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think
that that would be a reason for us not to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not something we’re thinking about at all
right now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair
Powell, you’ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence,
maybe cut back consumer spending—possible government shutdown, high gas prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At this
point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Would that help you get
inflation closer to your 2 percent target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I, I wouldn’t say it that way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re not looking for a decrease in
consumer spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a good thing that the
Page 24 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we’ve done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a good thing
that the labor market’s strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The, the only concern—it, it just means this: If the economy
comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary
policy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that answer your
question?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I guess, on the other hand, would you
worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, that’s always a concern.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I mean, concern number one is, is
restoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that
we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight
labor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that, that said—of
course, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how
quickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of
that consideration.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of
rate sensitivity than in the past.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Obviously, we’ve talked about households with long fixed-rate
mortgages—also companies that refinanced before last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What is your thinking about the
efficacy of rates and how that’s changed?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And then, related to that, how do you think about the
distributional consequences in the sense that if you’re a relatively wealthy household with a long
fixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if
Page 25 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a
lot tougher a lot more quickly?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has
been stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why is that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>One, one
is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had
understood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re not sure about
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question is whether that’s
sustainable.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It could
also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We don’t know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long
enough.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s—there are many candidate explanations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to, in, in all this
uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a
very strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We were making progress on
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth is strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call
for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s where we are, and, you
know, we have to—we have to deal with what comes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On your second question, which was—
sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer
about that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My point there was that if you’re somebody who has a
long fixed-rate mortgage, you’ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you’re
somebody who’s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are
punitive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 26 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And so the point I would make there is that we’re trying to get
inflation back down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a
fixed income.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If you’re a person who spends all of your income, you don’t really have any
meaningful savings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You spend all your income on the basics of life—clothing, food,
transportation, heating—the basics—and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you’re in trouble right
away, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and,
and we, we want to do it as quickly as possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Obviously, we—we’d like to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’d like
the current trend to continue, which is that we’re making progress without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that we’ve seen past—in past things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you’re right, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>When
we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to
feel that more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They are.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a—have a
much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to—it’s not going to affect
them as much.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>GREG ROBB.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In the Beige
Book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups
about the economic health of low-income Americans—moderate-income Americans.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I have two
questions about this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a
quarterly survey of those groups—like the senior loan officer survey?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And from your—and also
the second question is, from your recent look—readings of these surveys, how are low and
moderate Americans doing?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy
Page 27 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
Americans kind of driving things?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s an idea we
can—we can take away and think about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you
know, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think during the pandemic,
the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, if you know
the—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were
actually in very, very strong financial condition.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and
you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of]
real wages are now positive by most—by most measures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I, I think, overall, households are
in good shape.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Surveys are a different thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of
that is just, people hate inflation—hate it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s
terrible.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But, at the same time, they’re spending money.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Their behavior is, is not exactly what
you would expect from the surveys.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But
I, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in
the labor market and with wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low-
wage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages,
which is a good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks very much.</div>
