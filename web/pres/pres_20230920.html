Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
September 20, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.706)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Good afternoon, everyone.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">My colleagues and I remain squarely
focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the
American people.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain
strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Price stability is the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Without price stability, the economy does not work for
anyone.</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong
labor market conditions that benefit all.</span> <small>(0.537)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects
of our tightening have yet to be felt.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.588)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Looking ahead, we’re in a position
to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be
appropriate.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and
the evolving outlook and risks.</span> <small>(0.758)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly
reviewing economic developments.</span> <small>(0.852)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and,
so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations.</span> <small>(0.515)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Recent readings on
consumer spending have been particularly robust.</span> <small>(0.542)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Activity in the housing sector has picked up
somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage
rates.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In our
Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments
Page 1 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent.</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Participants expect growth
to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year.</span> <small>(0.593)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
better balance.</span> <small>(0.490)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a
strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year.</span> <small>(0.428)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The unemployment rate
ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The labor force participation rate has moved
up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Nominal wage growth
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Although the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</span> <small>(0.400)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward
pressures on inflation.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from
3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.552)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Based on the consumer
price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the
12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core
PCE prices rose 3.9 percent.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,
and longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad
range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent
has a long way to go.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this
year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</span> <small>(0.439)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My colleagues and I are acutely aware
Page 2 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</span> <small>(0.469)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage
points.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure
on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from
tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.</span> <small>(0.742)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In light of how far we have come in
tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the
federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our
securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">In our SEP,
FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the
federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most
likely scenario going forward.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this
year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025.</span> <small>(0.495)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Compared with our June
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year
but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">These projections, of
course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the
path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability
goals.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the
Page 3 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well
as the balance of risks.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the
incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Real interest rates now are well above
mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties
in precisely gauging the stance of policy.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,
and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving
down sustainably toward our objective.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to
keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Reducing inflation is likely to require
a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Restoring price
stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over
the longer run.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</span> <small>(0.632)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</span> <small>(0.570)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.576)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</span> <small>(0.813)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What makes the
Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive,
Page 4 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">There’s noted uncertainty about policy lags.</span> <small>(0.735)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Headwinds have emerged from the looming
government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt
payments—things of that nature.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.675)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit
differently.</span> <small>(0.602)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at
5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings.</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we say we’re
committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive
to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that.</span> <small>(0.644)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But the fact that we decided to
maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have
not at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you looked at
the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants
believe that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates
one more time in the two remaining meetings this year.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Others believe that we have already
reached that.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by
deciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.</span> <small>(0.414)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, right now, it’s still an open question about “sufficiently
restrictive”—you’re not saying today that we’ve reached this level?</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we
decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We want to see convincing
evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—
we’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, you know, we need to see more
progress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion.</span> <small>(0.388)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 5 of 28

COLBY SMITH.</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And just on the 2024 projections—what’s behind that shallower path
for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Right.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real
interest rates are, are positive now.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We
need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we need—
we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time.</span> <small>(0.420)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, you know—
remember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a
plan.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians.</span> <small>(0.693)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a cumulation of individual
forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians.</span> <small>(0.728)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I wouldn’t want to,
you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But what it reflects, though, is that
economic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be
appropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our
inflation goal, as you see in the SEP.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Rachel.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">RACHEL SIEGEL.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Hi, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</span> <small>(0.762)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks
for taking our questions.</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding
steady?</span> <small>(0.643)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing?</span> <small>(0.744)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Could
you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?</span> <small>(0.494)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our
current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that.</span> <small>(0.656)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But this,
of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think.</span> <small>(0.584)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And you’ve got—you
have some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between
Page 6 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
now and the end of the year.</span> <small>(0.663)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next
two meetings that we have between the end of the year.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So it wasn’t like we were arguing over
that—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see
how the data come in.”</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
want to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last
three months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right?</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We want to see, you
know—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good
example of what we do—of what we do want to see.</span> <small>(0.385)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was a combination of, of, you know,
of—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market.</span> <small>(0.533)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So those are
the two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that
we want to see.</span> <small>(0.567)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be
careful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that
the data, you know, support that conclusion.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and
how quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we
assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting
by meeting.</span> <small>(0.519)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I see.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, in your view, what would—I know nothing has been
decided yet—but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to
inflation?</span> <small>(0.604)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out
for us?</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one
way or the other won’t matter.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a
pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always
Page 7 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to be learning from data.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, we’ve learned all through the course of the last year
that, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought.</span> <small>(0.467)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you go back a year—and what we
thought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we, we don’t really
know until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point.</span> <small>(0.444)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A
year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Now—now we’re fairly close, we think,
to where we need to get.</span> <small>(0.389)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t
attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Nonetheless, you know, we
need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring
inflation down to 2 percent over time.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you
know, we’ve been moving toward it.</span> <small>(0.367)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at
which we’ve moved.</span> <small>(0.456)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think that was appropriate.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And now that we’re getting closer, we, we—
again, we have the ability to proceed carefully.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Steve.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">STEVE LIESMAN.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Steve Liesman, CNBC.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby’s
question here.</span> <small>(0.750)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">What is it saying about the Committee’s view of the inflation dynamic in the
economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a
point of the funds rate on it?</span> <small>(0.470)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Does it tell you that—does it tell us that the Committee believes
inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine, effectively?</span> <small>(0.373)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I guess a related
question is, if you’re going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a
row, at what point do we start to think, “Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually
higher”?</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense
of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen
Page 8 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that’s something
that’s appeared in the recent data.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s more about stronger economic activity, I would say.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So
if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to
attribute one explanation.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates—
we have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In
terms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works.</span> <small>(0.556)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We only
know it by its works, really.</span> <small>(0.642)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we
use, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.</span> <small>(0.741)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you
know, there are lags here.</span> <small>(0.397)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has
risen.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising
their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher
than, than the longer-run rate.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run
rate.</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is
higher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more
resilient than, than expected.</span> <small>(0.411)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Howard.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</span> <small>(0.609)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Howard Schneider with Reuters.</span> <small>(0.705)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’ve said
several times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation
consistently back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.558)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit—1.5 percent is just a
touch below what’s the estimate of potential.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So the fact that you’re getting so much done at so
much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how
Page 9 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction
that’s necessary to achieve this?</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yes, of course.</span> <small>(0.664)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now
meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s,
that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and
in the jobs–worker gap.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening.</span> <small>(0.455)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I would
say, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to
be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well.</span> <small>(0.462)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so
that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate
comes down.</span> <small>(0.416)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better
balance.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So all of those things are happening.</span> <small>(0.661)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we
don’t see a big increase in unemployment.</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is
just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing.</span> <small>(0.383)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That is not guaranteed.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">There, there
may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what
we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.</span> <small>(0.561)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So just to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we’ve
gone from a very narrow path to a—to a soft landing to something different.</span> <small>(0.585)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would you call the
soft landing now a baseline expectation?</span> <small>(0.480)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, no—I would not do that.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I would just say—what, what would
I say about that?</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that
there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted
off.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently.</span> <small>(0.413)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Ultimately,
Page 10 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
it—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day.</span> <small>(0.683)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I do
think it’s—I do think it’s possible.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know—I also think, you know, this is why we’re in
a position to, to move carefully again.</span> <small>(0.425)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">That—we, we will restore price stability.</span> <small>(0.592)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We, we know
that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we
have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is
an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We
know that.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve.</span> <small>(0.405)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I wouldn’t want to handicap
the likelihood of it, though.</span> <small>(0.603)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not up to me to do that.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">NICK TIMIRAOS.</span> <small>(0.651)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.</span> <small>(0.748)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">Chair Powell, both you and
Vice Chair Williams have indicated that “sufficiently restrictive” will be judged on a real rather
than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year—provided further
compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is the FOMC focused on
targeting a real level of policy restriction?</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And can you explain what would constitute enough
evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real
policy settings sufficiently restrictive?</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter
and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, again, I would say, you know—you know
“sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You—it’s not something you can arrive at with
confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so what are we seeing?</span> <small>(0.436)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the
pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing

demand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand—the combination of those two things is
actually working.</span> <small>(0.496)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down.</span> <small>(0.648)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s principally now in
goods—also in housing services.</span> <small>(0.698)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think—we think that that is working.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want
to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level.</span> <small>(0.372)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think
confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels
like it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.”</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that
level—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level?</span> <small>(0.387)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s a whole other set
of questions.</span> <small>(0.703)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.</span> <small>(0.598)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s, that’s what
we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.</span> <small>(0.398)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But it looks like there was—because there was an across-the-board
drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it
seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent.</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same
real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you—than you
currently anticipate?</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and,
certainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the
data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and
the other events that are happening out there.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I
can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that.</span> <small>(0.732)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a
Page 12 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that
would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help
us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jeanna.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.704)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Following up on Nick’s question,
actually—John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of,
“Next year, as we see inflation kind of”—again, to Nick’s point—“as, as we see inflation coming
down, we’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we’re not squeezing the
economy harder and harder over time.”</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I wonder if that’s basically the logic that you
apply—you know, is that how you think about it?</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then I also wonder—in the last press
conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, “It’s a full year out—those
discussions,” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’t see a possibility of a rate cut in
the first half of next year.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you
know—how you’re thinking about that timing.</span> <small>(0.538)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals
about, about cutting, I’m never intending to send a signal about timing; I’m just answering them
as, as the question is expressed.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way.</span> <small>(0.450)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry—
the first question was, is that how?</span> <small>(0.612)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question
we’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about
the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some
point, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut.</span> <small>(0.707)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Part of that may be that
real rates are rising because inflation is coming down.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the
factors that we see in the economy.</span> <small>(0.759)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.</span> <small>(0.523)</small></p>

<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I wonder—how
do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we’ve been seeing is driven
by excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth?</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, relatedly,
if GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own
be a reason to consider more tightening?</span> <small>(0.485)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very,
very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know.</span> <small>(0.581)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust

question was—
NEIL IRWIN.</span> <small>(0.741)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?</span> <small>(0.540)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question will be, is, is the
level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get
back to 2 percent inflation?</span> <small>(0.491)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s going to be the question.</span> <small>(0.563)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it—
you know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments,

can—you can look at.</span> <small>(0.539)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and
handicap all of them.</span> <small>(0.708)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these
things.</span> <small>(0.676)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the
strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other.</span> <small>(0.743)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we, we do have to make an
assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs.</span> <small>(0.580)</small></p>

uncertain.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>

<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve
looked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation.</span> <small>(0.452)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But that’s really
going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for.</span> <small>(0.418)</small></p>

The, the real point, though, is—the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price
stability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don’t restore price stability, inflation
comes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very
uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It can be a miserable period
to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and
again.</span> <small>(0.421)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think
now, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move
carefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do.</span> <small>(0.453)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So we fully appreciate that—you know, the
benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market
and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in
unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles.</span> <small>(0.381)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So—
MICHELLE SMITH.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Chris.</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</span> <small>(0.689)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of
what some economists are calling “the low-hanging fruit”—such as the unwinding of supply
chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions—or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that
involves most goods and services across the economy?</span> <small>(0.427)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way:
I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we
lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of
these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the
response.</span> <small>(0.377)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that unwinding was going to be important.</span> <small>(0.710)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In addition, monetary policy was going
to help.</span> <small>(0.782)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general,
Page 17 of 28

better aligning supply with demand.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So those two forces were always going to be important.</span> <small>(0.541)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
think it’s very hard to pull them apart.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I do think both of them are at

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In June,
you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you’ve more than
doubled your growth forecast.</span> <small>(0.486)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.</span> <small>(0.560)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, what
would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?</span> <small>(0.438)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And given all
the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or
the American people have in your forecasts?</span> <small>(0.763)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, forecasts are highly uncertain.</span> <small>(0.597)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Forecasting is very difficult.</span> <small>(0.636)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.</span> <small>(0.717)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">But to get to, to your question,
though—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right?</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Stronger than expected—and
that’s required higher rates.</span> <small>(0.430)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate
unemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in
the labor market.</span> <small>(0.432)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing
significantly higher unemployment.</span> <small>(0.426)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So we’re, we’re continuing that trend.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of inflation,
you, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings.</span> <small>(0.671)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s only three readings,
you know.</span> <small>(0.599)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings.</span> <small>(0.473)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But if you look
at June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core
inflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in
nonhousing services.</span> <small>(0.457)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Those are the three buckets.</span> <small>(0.725)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Headline inflation, of course, has come way
Page 18 of 28

down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I think—people
should know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain
forecasts.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But these are—these are our forecasts.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, they’re, they’re—we have very
high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other
forecasters.</span> <small>(0.647)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast.</span> <small>(0.825)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Given the—given the forecast that you have, what justified not
moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming
down?</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?</span> <small>(0.534)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate
increases that we’ve made.</span> <small>(0.423)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly,
and we did.</span> <small>(0.509)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary
policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the
risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening
becomes more equal.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach
that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it.</span> <small>(0.551)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that, that’s what we’re doing.</span> <small>(0.409)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So
we’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more
carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need
to get inflation back down to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.528)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question.</span> <small>(0.657)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What was—missed what
factors?</span> <small>(0.535)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The base factors.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Base factors.</span> <small>(0.574)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So on that, we’re, you know, we’re
looking at just monthly, right?</span> <small>(0.482)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase
was from the prior month.</span> <small>(0.521)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base
factors.</span> <small>(0.666)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But we can—we can adjust for that.</span> <small>(0.397)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we
don’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns.</span> <small>(0.566)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It—it’s possible—if, if there is a
government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t—
we wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we
would just have to deal with that.</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And I don’t know.</span> <small>(0.507)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s hard for me to say in advance how that
would affect that meeting.</span> <small>(0.406)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now.</span> <small>(0.583)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects
that—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November,
would you feel more comfortable at that point?</span> <small>(0.659)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, yes.</span> <small>(0.492)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how
much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?</span> <small>(0.498)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, I think—I think what we’re

June—we’re also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months’ inflation.</span> <small>(0.653)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods.</span> <small>(0.577)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That—that’s the right way to
go.</span> <small>(0.434)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what
to do.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We can let the data evolve.</span> <small>(0.460)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward.</span> <small>(0.512)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">EDWARD LAWRENCE.</span> <small>(0.610)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks for the question, Chair Powell.</span> <small>(0.774)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Edward Lawrence
with Fox Business.</span> <small>(0.685)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I want to focus back in on oil prices.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re seeing oil prices, as you
mentioned, move up, and that’s pushing the price of gas.</span> <small>(0.461)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So how does that factor into your
decision to raise rates or not—because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we’ve
seen, the overall inflation has actually risen?</span> <small>(0.382)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, you know, energy prices are very important for the
consumer.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">This, this can affect consumer spending.</span> <small>(0.497)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.</span> <small>(0.371)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment.</span> <small>(0.472)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It, it really
comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The reason why we look
at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.</span> <small>(0.505)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how
tight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">However, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high,
that’ll have an effect on spending.</span> <small>(0.489)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations
of inflation—things like that.</span> <small>(0.396)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s just things we have to monitor.</span> <small>(0.595)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On the consumer—they’re putting more and more of this on
their credit card.</span> <small>(0.630)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How long do you
Page 21 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And are you concerned
about a, a debt bubble related to that?</span> <small>(0.680)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to
look through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility.</span> <small>(0.629)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know,
turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully.</span> <small>(0.639)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Consumer distress—
measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—
during and after the, the pandemic.</span> <small>(0.401)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re now moving back up to normal.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re, we’re
watching that carefully.</span> <small>(0.433)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels.</span> <small>(0.618)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic
era.</span> <small>(0.699)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">JEAN YUNG.</span> <small>(0.544)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Jean Yung with MNI Market News.</span> <small>(0.724)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Yields along the Treasury curve
have risen to their highest in years.</span> <small>(0.573)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What is the Fed’s view about what’s been driving that
increase in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations—and how
much to technical factors?</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So you’re right.</span> <small>(0.403)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You know, rates have moved up significantly.</span> <small>(0.442)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">I
think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition
of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation
expectations.</span> <small>(0.513)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields—
and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this.</span> <small>(0.751)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a
very precise answer, but they give you different answers.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re
moving up because—it’s not because of inflation.</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s because probably—it’ll probably have
Page 22 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
something to do with stronger growth, I would say—more, more supply of Treasuries.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You
know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.</span> <small>(0.770)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">KYLE CAMPBELL.</span> <small>(0.640)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Kyle Campbell, American Banker.</span> <small>(0.760)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thank you for taking the
questions—just two on, on housing.</span> <small>(0.770)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline
and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’s also some questions out
there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which
are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental
market.</span> <small>(0.440)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it’s measured and
felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?</span> <small>(0.554)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And then as far as a constrained housing
supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now
than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about
taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over
time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents.</span> <small>(0.443)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And so—and supply is kind of
structurally constrained.</span> <small>(0.465)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as,
as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re-
leased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher.</span> <small>(0.446)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">A year ago, it would have
been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level.</span> <small>(0.510)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So as
those leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing
services inflation coming down.</span> <small>(0.479)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Your second question was the lock-ins.</span> <small>(0.741)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">How much is that
affecting things, really?</span> <small>(0.569)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 23 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
KYLE CAMPBELL.</span> <small>(0.734)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates
down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a
lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?</span> <small>(0.729)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea
being that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they
want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive.</span> <small>(0.449)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly
in the labor market.</span> <small>(0.448)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight—
in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates?</span> <small>(0.764)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">No, I, I don’t think it would.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I
mean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what,
what rates does the economy need?</span> <small>(0.536)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic
or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point
that—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy.</span> <small>(0.686)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think
that that would be a reason for us not to do that.</span> <small>(0.384)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s not something we’re thinking about at all
right now.</span> <small>(0.474)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so.</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>

<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Chair
Powell, you’ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence,
maybe cut back consumer spending—possible government shutdown, high gas prices.</span> <small>(0.481)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">At this
point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending?</span> <small>(0.350)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">Would that help you get
inflation closer to your 2 percent target?</span> <small>(0.458)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I, I wouldn’t say it that way.</span> <small>(0.451)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We’re not looking for a decrease in
consumer spending.</span> <small>(0.374)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong.</span> <small>(0.645)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a good thing that the
Page 24 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
economy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we’ve done.</span> <small>(0.695)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It’s a good thing
that the labor market’s strong.</span> <small>(0.390)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The, the only concern—it, it just means this: If the economy
comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary
policy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent.</span> <small>(0.667)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Does that answer your
question?</span> <small>(0.587)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And I guess, on the other hand, would you
worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?</span> <small>(0.522)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Well, that’s always a concern.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I mean, concern number one is, is
restoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that
we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight
labor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times.</span> <small>(0.506)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that, that said—of
course, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how
quickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of
that consideration.</span> <small>(0.517)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon.</span> <small>(0.484)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">SIMON RABINOVITCH.</span> <small>(0.637)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</span> <small>(0.739)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of
rate sensitivity than in the past.</span> <small>(0.694)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Obviously, we’ve talked about households with long fixed-rate
mortgages—also companies that refinanced before last year.</span> <small>(0.721)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">What is your thinking about the
efficacy of rates and how that’s changed?</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And then, related to that, how do you think about the
distributional consequences in the sense that if you’re a relatively wealthy household with a long
fixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if
Page 25 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
you’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a
lot tougher a lot more quickly?</span> <small>(0.625)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has
been stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates.</span> <small>(0.477)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Why is that?</span> <small>(0.514)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">One, one
is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had
understood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing.</span> <small>(0.545)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’re not sure about
that.</span> <small>(0.437)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot.</span> <small>(0.459)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The question is whether that’s
sustainable.</span> <small>(0.631)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later.</span> <small>(0.360)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could
also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons.</span> <small>(0.475)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We don’t know that.</span> <small>(0.424)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long
enough.</span> <small>(0.582)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And it’s—there are many candidate explanations.</span> <small>(0.529)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We have to, in, in all this
uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a
very strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance.</span> <small>(0.395)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">We were making progress on
inflation.</span> <small>(0.504)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Growth is strong.</span> <small>(0.363)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call
for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year.</span> <small>(0.464)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So that’s where we are, and, you
know, we have to—we have to deal with what comes.</span> <small>(0.502)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">On your second question, which was—
sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer
about that?</span> <small>(0.559)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">My point there was that if you’re somebody who has a
long fixed-rate mortgage, you’ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily.</span> <small>(0.454)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you’re
somebody who’s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are
punitive.</span> <small>(0.738)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Page 26 of 28

September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</span> <small>(0.709)</small></p>
<p class="bg-dovish-1"><span class="sent-text dovish">And so the point I would make there is that we’re trying to get
inflation back down.</span> <small>(0.596)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a
fixed income.</span> <small>(0.555)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">If you’re a person who spends all of your income, you don’t really have any
meaningful savings.</span> <small>(0.569)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">You spend all your income on the basics of life—clothing, food,
transportation, heating—the basics—and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you’re in trouble right
away, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb
that.</span> <small>(0.579)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and,
and we, we want to do it as quickly as possible.</span> <small>(0.623)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Obviously, we—we’d like to do that.</span> <small>(0.417)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">We’d like
the current trend to continue, which is that we’re making progress without seeing the kind of
increase in unemployment that we’ve seen past—in past things.</span> <small>(0.431)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But you’re right, though.</span> <small>(0.441)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">When
we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to
feel that more.</span> <small>(0.666)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">They are.</span> <small>(0.511)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a—have a
much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to—it’s not going to affect
them as much.</span> <small>(0.508)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Let’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.</span> <small>(0.677)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">GREG ROBB.</span> <small>(0.590)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Greg Robb from MarketWatch.</span> <small>(0.669)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In the Beige
Book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups
about the economic health of low-income Americans—moderate-income Americans.</span> <small>(0.621)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I have two
questions about this.</span> <small>(0.546)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a

Americans kind of driving things?</span> <small>(0.722)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector.</span> <small>(0.607)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey.</span> <small>(0.736)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s an idea we
can—we can take away and think about.</span> <small>(0.468)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you
know, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation.</span> <small>(0.586)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">I think during the pandemic,
the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful.</span> <small>(0.660)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And, you know, if you know
the—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were
actually in very, very strong financial condition.</span> <small>(0.613)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and
you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of]
real wages are now positive by most—by most measures.</span> <small>(0.408)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So I, I think, overall, households are
in good shape.</span> <small>(0.700)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Surveys are a different thing.</span> <small>(0.715)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of
that is just, people hate inflation—hate it.</span> <small>(0.530)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s
terrible.”</span> <small>(0.766)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But, at the same time, they’re spending money.</span> <small>(0.714)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Their behavior is, is not exactly what
you would expect from the surveys.</span> <small>(0.611)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be.</span> <small>(0.622)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">But
I, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in
the labor market and with wages.</span> <small>(0.531)</small></p>
<p class="bg-neutral-2"><span class="sent-text neutral">The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low-
wage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages,
which is a good thing.</span> <small>(0.404)</small></p>
<p class="bg-hawkish-3"><span class="sent-text hawkish">Thanks very much.</span> <small>(0.547)</small></p>
