Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
July 26, 2023
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Good afternoon.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Price stability is the responsibility of the
Federal Reserve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>In particular,
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions
that benefit all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary
policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and
we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve covered a lot of
ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Looking ahead, we will
continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming
that may be appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing
economic developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Although activity
in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely
reflecting higher mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear
to be weighing on business fixed investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor market remains very tight.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the past three months, job gains averaged
244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The
unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There are some continuing signs that supply and
Page 1 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The labor force participation rate has
moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Nominal wage growth
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>While the
jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of
available workers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Over the 12 months
ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In June, the 12-month change in the consumer
price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, the process
of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Despite elevated inflation,
longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial
markets.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>My colleagues and I are acutely aware
that high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and
transportation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our
mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are also continuing the
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With today’s action, we’ve raised our
Page 2 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
policy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have been seeing the effects of our
policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy,
particularly housing and investment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It will take time, however, for the full effects of our
ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In addition, the economy is
facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely
to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,
and economic and financial developments.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We will continue to make our decisions meeting by
meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for
economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping
longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Reducing inflation is likely to require a period
of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Restoring price stability
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the
longer run.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and
businesses across the country.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We at the
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELLE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Steve.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 3 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You have, I think a couple of times in
your opening remarks, talked about this language “in determining the extent of additional policy
firming that may be appropriate.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on
the way?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And should we also believe that all future meetings—say, September and November—
are live, or are you in an every-other-meeting mode?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s not
something we’ve looked at.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into
each meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we haven’t made any
decisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you
read the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations:
Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the
June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And the June CPI
report, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We hope that
inflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we
don’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, what are we going to be looking at?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader
picture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re looking for supply
and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the
labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’ll be looking at inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole
collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if we
make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how we’re thinking about
Page 4 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the next meeting and, you know, how we’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially,
but, you know, we’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we
get two more job reports, two more CPI reports.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I think we have an ECI report coming later this
week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would say it
is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant
it, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re
going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying
we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Monetary policy,
we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE LIESMAN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there: You
said the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Does that
mean there’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that
two more hikes are necessary?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m just going to go back to what I said.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we—you know, that’s
the question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I
recited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it really—we
did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s just one reading, as
everybody knows.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Many
forecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we
see the data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll be focusing on that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeanna.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 5 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
JEANNA SMIALEK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ve
seen the Barbie movie numbers.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this
summer.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does seem like
growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And I wonder, from your
perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know,
performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’s inflationary, or is it good news
because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Just how are you thinking about that sort
of trajectory?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the
economy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any
meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a
good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s good to see that, of course.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence
coming up and things like that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That will support activity going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you’re, you’re
right, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that
would require an appropriate response for monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’ll be watching that carefully
and seeing how it evolves over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHELE SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NEIL IRWIN.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Neil Irwin from Axios.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, as you referenced
earlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look
good.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if you’re data dependent, why not pause again?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why not stay on hold?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Why not take
another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 6 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So if you go back to what we’re trying to do here, we’re trying to
achieve a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At
the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that would take—of what that would
take, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would say, we looked at
the interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent,
but broadly consistent with expectations.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, as a result, we went ahead and, and took another
step.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And that’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but, but gradually
slowing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but, you
know, we’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from, from a single reading.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how we look at it, and, and so
we did take that step today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NICK TIMIRAOS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chair Powell, markets
widely believe the median FOMC participant’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter
of this year will be too high, given autos and shelter, and that by September, that may warrant a
downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Would that type of inflation
progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below-trend growth and
decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you’ve done enough?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of
this and how much of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we’ll be looking at everything.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we’ll, of
course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the
opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be looking at the growth
data.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall
Page 7 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
judgment about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on, on
making progress on inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>If I could follow up: Last month you said there were benefits to
moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that
slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
September, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots
of activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision
then.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that
we decide to maintain at that level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves
is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if we
get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee—
then we will move ahead.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining
policy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just
don’t have it yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So consumer
confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of, of the declines in headline
inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long
time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of
3 percent?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side
of the dual mandate?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 8 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I’d say it this way: First, it is—it is a good thing that
headline inflation has come down so much, because that’s really what the public experiences.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a—it
will strengthen the broad sense that, that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will
in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you are really—sorry, your question
was?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I mean, you’ve talked for many press conferences
now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So how much of that are we
still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess I would put it this way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s
really a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too
little?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there
really are risks on both sides.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not,
but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do
increasingly face that risk.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down
that far, you know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better
signal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by
volatile energy and food prices.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because
that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And
core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s reason to think it can come down now,
but it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re
Page 9 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And we need to
be prepared to raise further if that—if we think that’s appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, and then if inflation were to—just a quick
follow[up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in
unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People are talking
about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but how much?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one—
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment
rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So that’s a real
blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>It’s not
that we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have
to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and
slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so that is still the, the likely outcome here.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, we hope that that’s
as little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not
get it done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-
term social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is
volatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the—
that’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Michael McKee.</div>

MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we
have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to
the downside.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now
under these conditions?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Do you think you might need to do more, because I’m curious about
what you see as inflation dynamics now?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Is the economy still moving in a direction where it
creates more inflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have
some large labor settlements.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Or is the economy disinflating, and you’re just, you’re able to go
back to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is,
we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to
demand and supply.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to
help ease inflationary pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand
balance, particularly in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And all of that should lead to declining inflationary
pressures.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’re
seeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are
telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have
its full desired effects.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that
inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further
tighten if that is appropriate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long
way to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MICHAEL MCKEE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, do you think under current conditions you are restrictive
enough unless something changes?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 11 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I think—we think, you know, today’s rate hike was
appropriate, and I think we’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at
the next meeting about, is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And if it does
tell us that—collectively, if that’s our view—then we will do more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>COLBY SMITH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Colby Smith with the Financial Times.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>If September is,
in fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace
that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the
June meeting?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every
other meeting.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It could be two out of three meetings, right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It could be—it just means if you’re
slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and
closer to, we think, our destination.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every
other meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment
where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes
all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so
that’s what we did.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so I, I think it’s possible.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mentioned it before.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s possible that we
would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s
really going to depend on what the data tell us.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s the best we can do.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we shouldn’t assume that every other meeting is the lowest
tightening frequency, let’s say?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It could be, you know, longer intervals in between as well?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 12 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’re—look, I think we’re going to—we’re going to make a
decision about the next meeting, and then we’re going to make a decision about the one after
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think it’ll sort itself out.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>HOWARD SCHNEIDER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Howard Schneider with Reuters.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, among your
colleagues, there have been people who’ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken
place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it’s
happened very fast this time, and it’s kind of up to date.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Where are you on that continuum?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in
financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation,
right?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our
decisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier
than it—than it used to.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that
it has.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We know
that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and
variable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of
the lags.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>First, the first thing to say is, we’re
determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>No one should doubt that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would look at it this way, though.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>The real federal funds rate is now
in meaningfully positive territory.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the
mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is
Page 13 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
well above most estimates of the longer-term neutral rate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I would say, monetary policy is
restrictive, more so after today’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on
economic activity and inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not
appropriate to do so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how I think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are resolutely
committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Inflation has proved,
repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at
some point, that may change.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve
come, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>On the—on the credit side, I’m wondering if you saw
anything in the—in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’re getting a quantum of
credit contraction beyond what you’d expect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The bank lending data really is—the growth rate’s
edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession
indicator.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I
would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve got
lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it,
it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think it’s really hard to tease
out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the
overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS
will say.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 14 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Hi, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks
for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what
share of that credit you would give to factors that don’t stem directly from rate hikes or that
might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the
past year?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, interesting question.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So let me start by saying that the
inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and,
and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic
and the response from fiscal and monetary policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we’ve always expected that the
disinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-
related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which
would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And we think
that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down
sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a]
reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s, that’s a
good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>For core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both
factors, both that I mentioned.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing
an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into
services and away from goods.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And take autos as an example.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The combination of an increase in sales and inventories,
while, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s
Page 15 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
also a role for demand, as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So
they’re both working there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Housing services inflation now starts to move down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Clearly, higher
rates have, have slowed the housing market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, I would say, monetary policy is
working about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward,
in particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market
will come in as a very, very important factor.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we think both of those—both of those sources
of disinflation are playing an important role.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>RACHEL SIEGEL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources,
that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there a more even split
there, too?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward
because we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very
specific pandemic things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and
shortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be
important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Edward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Chair Powell.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>First, let me compliment your tie,
the choice of tie.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s a good color.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So thanks for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the Beige Book, it
said, “Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably” for
manufacturing sectors.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Is that an indication that there’s a, a wage inflation pressure?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And how
do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that
supply chains and, and shortages are easing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so, what was the first part of it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 16 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
EDWARD LAWRENCE.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, wage inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Like, how do you—how do you target
wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think what
we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s what
we’re seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So wages have actually been gradually moving down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They’re still at levels what
would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, we’re making progress there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And by so many indicators, labor market demand is
cooling.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can
look at the quits rate normalizing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can look at job openings coming down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You can look at
just job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it
was at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s actually not a bad thing, in
a sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is
really the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work,
getting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s
gradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want
to get.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But still we see a push to raise minimum wage.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re seeing
a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is, they come out with
agreements like big pay increases, like UPS, and we have the autoworkers coming up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are you
concerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contracts, pushing wage inflation
then?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 17 of 28

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>VICTORIA GUIDA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Victoria Guida with Politico.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I wanted to ask about the SEP,
which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under
3 percent.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And so I’m wondering, is the level of inflation what’s sort of important there as you
think about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which
inflation is falling also important?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think you’d take both into account.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think you’d take everything
into account when you start cutting rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide
range of things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just
is a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s
time to start cutting rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what
happens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So it’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there, what’s motivating people.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So if it’s sort of—sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you
wouldn’t necessarily cut rates?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m not giving you any
numerical guidance around that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when
we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It would be—you
know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think the median was several for next
year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,
Page 18 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
and it’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is, in fact, coming down to our 2 percent
goal.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>STEVE MATTHEWS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the
Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing, and they’ve reduced their forecast for a
recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession
being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident
that you can achieve a soft landing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and
my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without
the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in
some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s
been my view.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s still my view.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent
with, with what I see today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have
a lot left to go to see that happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the
forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a
recession.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is
independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Having an independent
staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our
process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make—
informs our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 19 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
STEVE MATTHEWS.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and
you still have a strong labor market?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I mean, does that add to the optimism?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would—I would
say, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve,
we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And
that’s, that’s a really good thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s
very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And consistent with having a soft
landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still
likely as we—as we go forward with this process.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t—
we haven’t really seen that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher
unemployment.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the
way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen
participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the
temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it
continues.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>JEFF COX.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>You and other Fed
officials in the past have suggested that you don’t need to keep hiking until inflation hits
2 percent, that—as long as you see continued progress.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So I’m wondering, how close do you
need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>How many months of data do you need to
Page 20 of 28

see that will—that will give you sufficient confidence, and how, how far does this fight need to
go before you’re willing to kind of declare victory on it?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to
2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s, that’s
clearly not the appropriate way to think about it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we,
we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a
grain of salt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal
funds rate is at a restrictive level now.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a
restrictive level anymore.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and
then below a neutral level at a certain point.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we would, you know, we would—we, of
course, would be very careful about that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming
down in a sustainable level.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical
assessment of when and where that would be.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d
start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before
you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation
until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.</div>

comfortable saying that we’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this
point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And how does this play into your outlook for policy?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I
will say, things have settled down for sure out there.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Deposit flows have stabilized.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Capital and
liquidity remain strong.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up
significantly year over year.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, we’re still watching,
you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the
banking sector.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were,
were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more
affected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort
of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>They may be
tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are
tightening.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think—I think
we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think—I think, basically,
we’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And that’s,
that’s going to restrain economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It is restraining economic activity.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s how I
would look at it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And how is that informing your outlook for setting
policy?</div>

CHAIR POWELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So I think we—that goes—that’s—an expected result of tightening
interest rate policy is that—is that bank credit conditions—bank lending conditions would
tighten as well.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened
in May?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I just don’t think we know that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’re looking at the current data in GDP, and
we’re seeing strong spending.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>We’re seeing a strong economy, and it’s made us confident that
we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I—it
seems like the economy is weathering this well, but, of course, we’re watching it carefully and,
and expect to continue to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Megan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Thanks for taking our questions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Megan
Cassella with Barron’s.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary
impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer
sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we’ve been seeing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that
increases in] real wages are positive.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Again, that’s a great thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of course, we want that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We
want people to have [gains in] real wages.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s
consistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages
have been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We expect to see more of
that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>We don’t really think
that, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I
would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Labor market conditions
broadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we
think we need some further softening in labor market conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Page 23 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
MEGAN CASSELLA.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you
mentioned at the start how you’re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might
be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families
if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment
back down.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s the message there of, of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise
them?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get
inflation under control.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit
those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get
inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We think that is the most
important thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away
are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or,
you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re
just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right
away.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>People, people
on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we need—we need to
get this done.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we
don’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s, that’s how I would explain what
we’re doing.</div>

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>SIMON RABINOVITCH.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Simon Rabinovitch with the
Economist.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>In
Page 24 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
the event, the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate
move that you announced today.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The decision was, of course, unanimous, and the statement was
basically unchanged from last month.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting
actually a live one?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision
was, was actually going to be?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Well, I mean, you could—“Was there doubt?”</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Look, I would say
there’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks, you’ll
see that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should
do at the next meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Many times when we go
into a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nonetheless, we have the
meeting, and some—some—some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others, and I’ll
just leave it at that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Evan.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>EVAN RYSER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Evan Ryser, Market News International.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks—the dollar, the
stock market, et cetera.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come
down to target?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial
conditions.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course,
very focused on rates and our own policy.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy
tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication
is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could
mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But what tends to happen,
Page 25 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
though, is, financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we’re doing, and, and,
ultimately, over time, we get where we need to go.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>If I could also ask about the SEP from June that showed rate cuts—do
you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>So that, that could happen.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The question is, you know, is that
consistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world
where things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more
normal levels.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to
continue it, depending on where you are in the cycle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So they are two independent things.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And,
you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But you can imagine circumstances
in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different
ways.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But that wouldn’t be the case.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Kyle.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>KYLE CAMPBELL.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Kyle Campbell with American Banker.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I
have a question about the discount window.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I’m wondering if, since the bank failures of the
spring, if you’ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that
they’re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether
policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to, to show that
they are prepared to use it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So that’s a very important thing.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And yes to both sides of that.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window,
and we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We did find, as you know,
during the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>It can be a little
Page 26 of 28

July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL
clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So why not be in a situation where, where
you’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Let’s go to Mark Hamrick.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>MARK HAMRICK.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>You’ve talked in the
past about getting the housing market back into better balance—excuse me—and also that the
market might have bottomed.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right
now, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might
otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and,
of course, also all of that happening with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage still around 7 percent
on the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’re talking about tightening industry lending
standards?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Are we getting closer to balance or farther away?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>What’s your sense?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the
reasons that you talked about.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have
low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going
to because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing
homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>On the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and,
and there are people coming in.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming
in, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>But I think this will take some time to work through.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Hopefully, more supply comes on line,
and, you know, we, we work through it.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath
of the—of the pandemic.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.</div>

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Nancy Marshall-Genzer with

<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage
through the Black Sea, and alternative routes at this point could be closed off.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-neutral-2'>Just wondering,
how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, and how closely are you
watching that?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>We are watching it, of course, very closely.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>And you’re right.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>The
withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security,
particularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Grain prices did go up on
this news, but they remain well below their peaks of last spring.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-dovish-1'>And the moves that we’ve seen
so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Of
course, we will be watching that situation carefully.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>So you don’t think it would have a big effect on Fed
policy at this point?</div>
<div class='sent-text bg-hawkish-3'>Doesn’t.</div>
