NOTE: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the pre-
vious year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index
for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the aver-
age civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate
monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under ap-
propriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The November projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee on November 1–2, 2011.
1. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
2. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
3. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

| Voting against this action: Jeffrey M. Lacker.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mr. Lacker dissented because he preferred to omit the     |
| description of the time period over which economic        |
| conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low le-   |
| vels of the federal funds rate. He expected that a        |
| preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be         |
| necessary to prevent an increase in inflation projections |
| or inflation expectations prior to the end of 2014.       |
| More broadly, given the inclusion of FOMC partici-        |
| pants’ projections for the federal funds rate target in   |
| the Summary of Economic Projections, he saw no need       |
| to provide additional forward guidance in the Commit-     |
| tee statement.                                            |
| It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee      |
| would be held on Tuesday, March 13, 2012. The meet-       |
| ing adjourned at 11:30 a.m. on January 25, 2012.          |
| Notation Vote                                             |
| By notation vote completed on December 30, 2011, the      |
| Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the         |
| FOMC meeting held on December 13, 2011.                   |
