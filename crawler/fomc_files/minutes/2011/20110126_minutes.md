NOTE: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and in inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of
the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in
the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the
absence of further shocks to the economy. The November projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on
November 2–3, 2010.
1. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
2. The range for a variable in a given year consists of all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
3. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

| “Information received since the Federal          |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| Open Market Committee met in December            |
| confirms that the economic recovery is con-      |
| tinuing, though at a rate that has been insuf-   |
| ficient to bring about a significant improve-    |
| ment in labor market conditions. Growth in       |
| household spending picked up late last year,     |
| but remains constrained by high unemploy-        |
| ment, modest income growth, lower housing        |
| wealth, and tight credit. Business spending      |
| on equipment and software is rising, while       |
| investment in nonresidential structures is still |
| weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to       |
| payrolls. The housing sector continues to be     |
| depressed. Although commodity prices have        |
| risen, longer-term inflation expectations have   |
| remained stable, and measures of underlying      |
| inflation have been trending downward.           |
| Consistent with its statutory mandate, the       |
| Committee seeks to foster maximum em-            |
| ployment and price stability. Currently, the     |
| unemployment rate is elevated, and measures      |
| of underlying inflation are somewhat low,        |
| relative to levels that the Committee judges     |
| to be consistent, over the longer run, with its  |
| dual mandate. Although the Committee an-         |
| ticipates a gradual return to higher levels of   |
| resource utilization in a context of price sta-  |
| bility, progress toward its objectives has been  |
| disappointingly slow.                            |
| To promote a stronger pace of economic re-       |
| covery and to help ensure that inflation, over   |
| time, is at levels consistent with its mandate,  |
| the Committee decided today to continue          |
| expanding its holdings of securities as an-      |
| nounced in November. In particular, the          |
| Committee is maintaining its existing policy     |
| of reinvesting principal payments from its       |
| securities holdings and intends to purchase      |
| $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securi-     |
| ties by the end of the second quarter of         |
| 2011. The Committee will regularly review        |
| the pace of its securities purchases and the     |
| overall size of the asset-purchase program in    |
| light of incoming information and will adjust    |
