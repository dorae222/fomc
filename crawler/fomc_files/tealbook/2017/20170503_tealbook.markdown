Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

e
v
e
The information that we have received since the March Tealbook suggests that D
n
resource utilization has continued to tighten. In particular, the labor market news, which o
c
E
includes the two most recent employment reports, was strong. The unemployment rate c
ti
s
moved down to 4.5 percent in March even as the labor force participation rate (LFPR) e
m
moved a little further above its estimated trend, and the average pace of payroll growth in o
D
the first quarter remained solid. As a result, we now see the labor market as running a
little tighter than we had earlier anticipated.1 Although the incoming spending data for
the first quarter have been disappointing, on balance, our assessment is that the weakness
will be temporary. We now estimate that real GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of
only 1 percent in the first quarter, but we expect it to bounce back to a pace of around
2½ percent this quarter, leaving the average over the first half unrevised from the March
projection.
Beyond the near term, real GDP growth is marginally stronger in this projection,
mostly reflecting a somewhat lower path for the dollar. We expect growth to average a
bit above 2 percent this year and next, supported in part by the fiscal expansion that we
expect will begin in 2018. We project growth to slow a bit in 2019, partly reflecting the
ongoing gradual normalization of monetary policy assumed in our forecast. With real
GDP growth expected to outpace our estimate of potential output growth, real economic
activity further overshoots its sustainable level. As a result, the unemployment rate is
projected to fall to 4 percent by the end of 2019, nearly 1 percentage point below our
estimate of the natural rate, which we have edged down to 4.9 percent.
The March reading on the consumer price index (CPI) was considerably lower
than we had anticipated. We now estimate that total PCE price inflation (measured on a
12-month change basis) was 1.9 percent in March, and that core inflation was
1.6 percent; both measures are 0.2 percentage point lower than we expected in our
previous forecast. However, because we see the March CPI as having been somewhat
anomalous, and in response to recent higher-than-expected import prices, we nudged up
our projection for core inflation over the next few months, offsetting a portion of the
negative March surprise. Our inflation projection beyond this year is not materially
1 We judge the labor market to be tighter notwithstanding some small adjustments—discussed
later—that we made to our supply-side assumptions this round.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
v The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is below the projections from the Survey
e
D
of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017 and
n
o lower than the Blue Chip in 2018. The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is a
c
E
bit below the Blue Chip and SPF surveys in 2017 and below the Blue Chip in 2018. The
c
ti
staff’s CPI inflation projection is below those of outside forecasters in 2017 and is the
s
e
m same as them in 2018. The staff’s projections for both overall and core PCE price
o
inflation are below the SPF forecasts in 2017 and 2018.

different from what we showed in the March Tealbook. We continue to project that core t l

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
o
c
E
c
Fiscal Policy ti
s
e
m
 We have retained our placeholder assumption that adjustments to federal
o
D
fiscal policy will increase the primary budget deficit (that is, the deficit
excluding interest costs) by 1 percent of GDP, and that this fiscal expansion
will take the form of a cut in personal income taxes starting in the first quarter
of 2018. There is considerable uncertainty about the potential size, timing,
and composition of these fiscal policy changes. Indeed, given that progress
toward coalescing around a specific set of policy changes has been slow, we
view this uncertainty as even greater than it was at the time of the March
Tealbook.
 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government
will increase the rate of real GDP growth about ¼ percentage point in 2017,
½ percentage point in 2018, and ¼ percentage point in 2019, about the same
as in the March Tealbook.
 In the near term, funding for all discretionary federal government programs
runs out on April 28. We assume that an agreement providing funding beyond
that date will be reached with no major disruptions to government operations,
and that the size and composition of spending will be little changed by the
agreement.2
Monetary Policy
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection
calls for the federal funds rate to increase about 1 percentage point per year,
on average, over the projection period and to average 3.5 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2019—just a touch higher than in the March Tealbook.
2 We estimate that a one-week federal government shutdown starting at the end of April would
subtract around ¼ percentage point (annual rate) from real GDP growth in 2017:Q2 and add a comparable
amount to growth in 2017:Q3.

k
o
o
t l  We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current
u
O
level until the third quarter of 2017 and then begin to contract, as the proceeds
&
e l from principal repayments on securities held in the portfolio are no longer
v
e
D reinvested.
n
o
c
E
Other Interest Rates
c
ti
s
e  Over the next few quarters, the 10-year Treasury yield is a little lower than in
m
o our March projection, as market rates have come in below our previous
D
projection. The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise to 3.9 percent by
the end of 2019—modestly above its assumed longer-run value of 3.5 percent.
 The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is revised mostly in line with the
revisions to the path for the 10-year Treasury yield. However, triple-B
corporate bond spreads are currently about 20 basis points narrower than we
had projected in the March Tealbook, and our projection carries forward part
of this narrower spread into next year.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices have declined around 1½ percent since the March Tealbook,
whereas we had projected them to remain about flat. Nevertheless, notable
valuation pressures remain implicit in our projection, and our view is that
those pressures will limit the scope for further stock price appreciation over
the medium term. As a result, equity prices are projected to rise at an average
annual rate of only about 1 percent through 2019, similar to the projected rate
of increase in the March Tealbook. (Implications of a decline in equity prices
are explored in alternative scenarios included in the Risks and Uncertainty
section.)
 Recent data on house prices have been slightly weaker than expected, and we
have nudged down our forecast for house price appreciation this year to
around 5½ percent. We estimate that house prices are somewhat above their
normal historical relationship with rents and therefore continue to project that
growth in home values will slow to around 4 percent in 2018 and 2019.

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar t l
u
O
 Incoming data suggest a bit greater near-term momentum in the foreign &
l
economies than we anticipated at the time of the March Tealbook. We now e
v
e
estimate total real foreign GDP growth in the first quarter of nearly 3 percent D
n
o
at an annual rate. We see growth abroad moderating to 2½ percent by the c
E
third quarter, largely reflecting a deceleration of economic activity in Canada, c
ti
s
and we expect foreign growth to remain at this near-potential pace through the e
m
o
medium term. D
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 1½ percent since the time of
the March Tealbook. Going forward, we expect the broad real dollar to
appreciate at an annual rate of about 1½ percent over the forecast period, as
market expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff
forecast. Reflecting recent dollar depreciation, our projection for the broad
real dollar at the end of 2019 is 1 percent lower than in the March Tealbook.
Oil and Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $3 per barrel since the time
of the March Tealbook to $53 per barrel. Spot prices have been volatile,
falling about $5 between the March Tealbook and the March FOMC meeting
before mounting a recovery that persisted through the week ending April 14.
Prices responded to both news about U.S. oil production and inventories as
well as changing market conviction regarding OPEC’s commitment to cut
production. As in the March Tealbook, we project that oil prices will decline
gradually over the projection period.
 Prices for industrial metals have fallen more than 5 percent since the March
Tealbook, as short-term supply disruptions in the production of copper and
nickel have been resolved. Even with these declines, metals prices are still
notably higher than they were last October when they started rising on
expectations for a pickup in global activity and slower growth in supply.
Food and agricultural prices have fallen 6 percent since the March Tealbook,
mainly reflecting upward revisions to the supply outlook for several crops.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP t l
u
O
&
The news on spending since the March Tealbook has been negative, on balance,
l
e
v
with downward surprises for PCE and federal defense purchases only partially offset by e
D
upside surprises in residential investment, oil drilling activity, and exports. We currently n
o
c
estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of only about 1 percent in the first E
c
quarter after increasing at a 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter; this deceleration mainly s
ti
e
m
reflects a sharp slowdown in real PCE growth. However, we see the soft PCE reading as
o
D
mostly temporary, and we project that real GDP growth will pick up to a 2½ percent pace
in the current quarter.3
 Real PCE growth appears to have slowed to an annual rate of only ½ percent
in the first quarter. As previously noted, we see much of this slowing as
transitory. Spending on energy services was held down by unseasonably
warm weather through February, and we expect it to pick up in the second
quarter, assuming temperatures return to seasonal norms. Spending in some
non-energy services categories, which is currently estimated to have been soft
in the first quarter after rising strongly in the fourth, is also expected to
rebound. Similarly, sales of motor vehicles stepped down in the first quarter
from a very high level in the fourth, and we expect vehicle sales to decline
only a little further this quarter. Finally, spending in the broad category
covered by non-auto retail sales, which was especially weak in February,
rebounded in March, albeit to a lower level than we had anticipated.4 With
ongoing gains in employment and income as well as still-upbeat levels of
sentiment, PCE growth is expected to step back up to a rate of 3 percent in the
second quarter, about the same pace as we forecast in the previous Tealbook.
 Equipment and intangibles (E&I) investment is estimated to have increased at
an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, a little more than the
1½ percent gain in the fourth quarter of last year but less than we expected in
the March Tealbook. Several indicators of business spending remain upbeat;
for example, new orders of nondefense capital goods have posted net gains in
recent months, and indexes of business sentiment and activity are still
3 The BEA’s first estimate of GDP growth for 2017:Q1 will be released on Friday, April 28.
4 We think some of the decline in retail sales in February and the rebound in March reflected the
temporary hold on federal tax refunds with an earned income tax credit or a child tax credit that was
introduced this year.

 The recent data on housing activity have remained positive despite the rise in
mortgage rates since last fall. Starts for single-family homes edged up in the
first quarter, and permits strengthened. Sales of existing homes declined in
February, but pending home sales, which tend to lead actual sales by a month
or two, increased notably. Some of the recent strength in housing activity
may reflect a pull-forward in response to the warmer-than-usual February
weather, the anticipation of a further rise in interest rates, or both. As a result,
we continue to expect that a jump in residential investment growth in the first
quarter will give way to modest declines in the second and third quarters as
higher mortgage rates start to weigh more heavily on housing demand.
 Export growth has been surprisingly strong in recent months; as a result, net
exports are estimated to have been a smaller drag on first-quarter real GDP
growth than we had been expecting. Export growth is expected to slow in the
current quarter but to remain at a pace above that in the March Tealbook. On
average, net exports are projected to subtract about ¼ percentage point from
GDP growth in the first half of 2017, about half of the drag in the previous
forecast.
 Manufacturing production recorded a moderate increase in the first quarter as
a whole despite declining in March. The first-quarter increase, together with
continued strength in the new orders indexes from the national and regional
manufacturing surveys, suggests that factory output will increase modestly in
coming months. We project that manufacturing production will increase at an

revised and the key conditioning factors are slightly more positive, mostly
reflecting the somewhat lower projected path for the dollar.
 Over the medium term, real GDP growth is expected to outpace potential
growth. (We assume that potential GDP growth will rise gradually from
1½ percent this year to 1¾ percent in 2019.) We forecast real GDP to be
about 1¾ percent above potential at the end of 2019, a tenth more than in the
March Tealbook.
 The box “Tealbook Forecast Errors: An Update through 2016” reviews recent

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
Taken together, the two employment reports since the March Tealbook suggest
that labor market conditions continued to tighten through the first quarter and by
somewhat more than we had previously expected.5
 Key indicators from the household survey were stronger than we projected in
the March Tealbook. After edging down (as expected) to 4.7 percent in
February, the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent in March, 0.2 percentage
point lower than we anticipated. The LFPR unexpectedly increased to
63.0 percent in February and remained at that level in March, 0.2 percentage
point above our March Tealbook forecast.
 We responded to the incoming data by lowering our projection for the
unemployment rate in the current quarter 0.2 percentage point, to 4.5 percent.

FOMC meeting but not when we published the March Tealbook.

e
v The staff’s forecast errors for 2016 were relatively small. Real gross domestic
e
D product (GDP) growth in 2016, although still subject to sizable revisions, is currently
n
o estimated to be close to staff forecasts from one and two years ago. As was the
c
E case in recent years, the unemployment rate finished 2016 lower than the staff’s
c
ti prior‐year forecast, though it was in line with the staff forecast from April 2016.
s
e Tealbook forecasts of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation
m
o in 2016 were slightly too low. Here we discuss these recent forecast errors.
D
In the left panel of figure 1, the gray bars show the currently published Q4/Q4 percent
changes in real GDP from 2013 to 2016, the blue squares show the forecasts for GDP
growth made in the April Tealbook one year prior, and the green triangles show the
forecast from the April Tealbook in the contemporaneous year. The whisker bands
demarcate 70 percent forecast error bands, so that unusually large forecast errors are
represented by cases where the top edge of a gray bar falls outside of the whisker
band.1 The red dots show the GDP growth estimates for each year from mid‐April of
the subsequent year, along with 70 percent bands computed from past revisions to
those estimates. Staff forecast errors for real GDP growth in 2016 are small, well
within the 70 percent whisker bands, although the staff’s prior‐year GDP projection
was too high for the third consecutive year.
The right panel shows the same information for the unemployment rate. The April
2016 forecast was on the mark, a notable improvement over projections from earlier
years.2 However, the April 2015 Tealbook forecast of the unemployment rate in
2016:Q4 was too high, continuing a pattern of one‐sided errors in forecasts. Unlike
forecasts from earlier in the expansion, when the labor force participation rate was

percentage point) are small by historical standards.

persistently lower than the staff expected (not shown), the labor force participation O
rate finished 2016 slightly higher than the staff anticipated in 2015. Accordingly, staff &
l
prior‐year forecasts of the employment‐to‐population ratio (also not shown) were e
v
somewhat more accurate in the few preceding years than in 2016, as forecast errors in e

the unemployment and labor force participation rates were offsetting in 2013 through n

The combination of lower‐than‐expected GDP growth and a lower‐than‐expected e s
m
unemployment rate over the past few years has prompted the staff to make a series of
o
adjustments to its supply‐side assumptions. Most notably, the staff has lowered its D
estimate of structural productivity growth on several occasions over this period.
Figure 2 shows the same information for the Q4/Q4 percent changes in total and core
PCE prices. The staff’s prior‐year forecast of 2016 total PCE price inflation was close to
the currently published reading, whereas the forecast made in April 2016 was too low.
The difference between the forecasts made in April 2015 and April 2016 importantly
reflects the staff’s oil price projections. Oil prices unexpectedly fell early in 2016 and
then rebounded later that year. The staff projection in April 2015 anticipated neither
the early‐2016 decline nor the later rebound and proved more accurate for oil price
inflation than the staff projection in April 2016, which had taken onboard the early 2016
decline but had forecast a smaller rebound.
Staff forecasts for core PCE price inflation in 2016 were a couple of tenths of a
percentage point too low. The misses were concentrated in services prices and, in
particular, nonmarket prices, which wound up higher than expected. From 2013 to
2015, the staff’s year‐ahead core inflation forecasts were slightly too high. As it turns
out, those forecast errors can be explained by core goods import prices that came in
lower than expected. Conditioning on the actual path of import prices and other
observable factors, core inflation from 2013 to 2015 was, as in 2016, slightly higher than
the staff can explain. These positive residuals might reflect, among other things, a
higher inflation trend than the staff assumes or a larger contribution to core inflation
from resource utilization, or they may simply be the result of idiosyncratic shocks.

o
D
o In the first quarter, private payrolls increased 171,000 per month,
on average—about 30,000 less per month than expected in the
March Tealbook. The March gain was only 89,000, but we think
that much of the swing from February’s 221,000 increase was
accounted for by weather-related influences.6
o In contrast to private payrolls, total government employment came
in somewhat above our expectation. This upside surprise, which
was concentrated in federal employment, suggests that the federal
hiring freeze was less binding than we had expected. We now
assume that federal payrolls will be flat starting in May, rather than
falling 5,000 per month as we had previously projected.
As we have discussed in previous Tealbooks, we have been surprised during the
past few years by the extent of the improvement in labor market conditions given the
pace of real GDP growth. In response to those earlier surprises, on several occasions we
reduced our estimate of potential GDP growth and made less-significant changes to the
natural rate of unemployment. This round, with productivity close to our estimate of its
trend, a further reduction in potential output growth did not seem to be called for.
Accordingly, we trimmed our estimate of the natural rate and raised our estimate of the
trend LFPR.7 Specifically, we have slightly slowed the decline in the trend LFPR from
6 Private payroll gains in February and March were affected by the unusually warm weather in
February, which boosted the increase in payrolls in that month and held it down in March. Separately, we
estimate that the major winter storm that hit the Northeast during the March survey’s reference period held
down private payroll gains in that month by about 20,000.
7 Our decision to revise up the trend LFPR also reflected a reevaluation of the trend for young
persons and some evidence that some workers previously reporting themselves as disabled have returned to
the workforce.

 Our current-quarter projection of the unemployment rate (at 4.5 percent) is D
0.4 percentage point below its natural rate, a 0.1 percentage point wider gap
than in the March projection, while our forecast for the LFPR (62.8 percent)
exceeds its trend by 0.1 percentage point, about the same as in the previous
Tealbook.
 We continue to view some of the other indicators of labor market slack as
slightly elevated. The share of individuals working part time for economic
reasons and the long-term unemployment rate, while having declined further
during the first three months of the year, remain above their average levels
before the 2007–09 recession.
As in the March Tealbook, the labor market is projected to improve further over
the medium term and is expected to be quite tight by the end of 2019.
 Average monthly total payroll gains are expected to slow from 180,000 in
2017 to 120,000 in 2019.
 After decreasing about 1 percentage point since early 2015, the
unemployment rate is projected to decline another ½ percentage point over
the medium term and to reach 4.0 percent at the end of 2019, 0.1 percentage
point below the previous projection. The small revision at the end of the
forecast period reflects the lower assumed natural rate of unemployment.
 Both the LFPR and the employment-to-population ratio continue to improve
relative to their declining trends.

D THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Taken as a whole, the news bearing on consumer price inflation was softer than
we expected in the March Tealbook and resulted in a lower near-term inflation outlook.
 The CPI declined 0.3 percent in March, and, strikingly, the core index
declined 0.1 percent; the current vintage of the core CPI data shows only five
other monthly declines since 1980. Our translation of these data, along with
the March PPI, suggests that core PCE prices also declined 0.1 percent in
March following a surprisingly large increase in core prices in January and a
more modest increase in February.
 We think much of the softness in the March consumer price data reflects
transitory or one-off factors.10 Based on that assessment and in light of the
upward surprise in import prices (discussed later), we have marginally raised
our projection for core inflation over the next few months, thereby offsetting a
portion of the negative March surprise.11 (In January, when the incoming
inflation data were surprisingly strong, we similarly tempered the implications
of the news for our forecast.)
9 Productivity typically declines relative to its structural level when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly reflecting workers with lower-than-average productivity being drawn into the workforce.
10 For example, we view the relatively large declines in the CPI for lodging away from home
(which fell 2.8 percent) and apparel (which fell 0.7 percent) as transitory movements, and we expect some
of these declines to be reversed in the coming months. Separately, the CPI for wireless telephone services
declined 7.0 percent in March (monthly rate), reducing the monthly change in the core CPI by about
0.15 percentage point; we view that decline as unlikely to repeat.
11 Had we maintained our monthly assumptions for the remaining months of the year (and thus
ignored the stronger import price information and not built in any bounceback from the downward surprise
in the CPI in March), the news in the March CPI report would have lowered our 2017 core PCE inflation
projection 0.2 percentage point instead of 0.1 percentage point.

 We now estimate that the 12-month change in core PCE prices moved down t l
u
O
to 1.6 percent in March—0.2 percentage point lower than we had expected.
&
Given the partial offset to the March surprise that we built into our near-term e l
v
e
projection, we expect this measure to edge back up to 1.7 percent by June, D
n
0.1 percentage point below the previous Tealbook. We expect the 12-month o
c
E
change in total PCE prices to be a bit below 2 percent over this period. c
ti
s
e
m
 The recent data on import prices have been stronger than we expected. Core
o
D
import prices are now estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 1 percent in
the first quarter, whereas in the March Tealbook we projected a slight decline.
Recent dollar weakness is expected to push core import price inflation up to
an annual rate of 1¾ percent over the next two quarters, higher than the
average over the previous five years. Thereafter, import price inflation is
expected to slow to a ¾ percent pace, consistent with moderate foreign
inflation, a gradually appreciating dollar, and slowly declining commodity
prices.
 The incoming data on longer-run inflation expectations have moved lower
since the March Tealbook. Median expectations over the next 5 to 10 years
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged down to
2.4 percent in March and remained at that level in the preliminary April
reading. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer
Expectations reported that the median inflation expectation 3 years ahead
declined to 2.7 percent in March after having increased since November. The
TIPS-based measures for both 5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward inflation
compensation, currently at 1.8 and 1.9 percent, respectively, have edged down
from the 2 percent level seen at the time of the March Tealbook.
Our core inflation projection for 2017 is 0.1 percentage point lower than in the
March Tealbook but is unrevised thereafter. Over the three-year period from 2016 to
2019, core inflation rises from 1.7 percent to 2.0 percent while total PCE price inflation is
anticipated to move up from 1.4 percent to 1.9 percent. The ¼ percentage point
acceleration in core inflation between 2016 and 2019 mainly reflects the diminishing
pass-through from earlier declines in energy prices and core import prices, along with the
further tightening of resource utilization. In addition, we continue to assume a small
pickup (5 basis points in both 2018 and 2019) in the prevailing level of inflation
expectations relevant for wage and price setting.

Immigration and Economic Growth
&
l
e
v Immigration has historically been an important source of population growth in
e
D
the United States. According to estimates by the Census Bureau, net
n
o immigration flows (both legal and unauthorized) accounted for about one-third
c
E
of the roughly 1 percent average annual population growth rate over the past
c
ti
50 years. In the latest year for which data are available, 2015, net immigration is
s
e
m estimated to have been about 1.15 million persons. Altogether, an estimated
o
43 million foreign-born individuals resided in the United States that year, of which
D
about 11 million were unauthorized.1
In the staff projection, potential output rises 1.7 percent per year over the next
10 to 15 years. As can be seen in the second bar from the right in figure 1 (labeled
2020s), about 0.9 percentage point of this growth is attributable to population
growth (the sum of the blue and cross-hatched portions of the bar), of which
about half (the blue portion) is due to net immigration.2 Other sources of
potential gross domestic product (GDP) growth (shown by the red portion of the
bar) include the combined contribution of the trends in the labor force
participation rate, the average workweek, and labor productivity.
In a standard “growth accounting” framework, such as the one used by the staff,
a reduction in population growth reduces the growth rate of potential GDP by
the same amount (holding productivity growth and other factors constant). In
this framework, a change in immigration policy that reduced net immigration by
500,000 persons per year would, all else being equal, reduce the growth rate of
potential GDP between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point. If all unauthorized
immigrants—who constitute roughly 5 percent of the U.S. labor force—were
removed or emigrated, this change would have a substantial effect on the level
of potential GDP.
Changes to immigration policy will have spillovers beyond the direct effect on the
population, so the total effect may be larger or smaller than this simple
calculation would suggest. For example, the immigrant population has, on
average, a higher labor force participation rate than the native-born population;
as a result, lower net immigration could reduce the trend participation rate a bit,
all else being equal, implying a larger downward effect on potential GDP.
Alternatively, a reduction in the number of immigrants would effectively raise the
1 Estimates of the number of unauthorized immigrants are from the Pew Research Center
and are obtained by subtracting an estimate of the number of legal immigrants (derived from
administrative records) from an estimate of the overall foreign-born population (derived from
national surveys such as the American Community Survey).
2 The staff uses the Census Bureau’s projections of population growth in its forecast of
potential output. The numbers in figure 1 refer to the working-age population—the relevant
population for thinking about potential output. Using the full population instead would yield a
similar decomposition.

amount of capital available per worker, all else being equal, and might therefore O
boost average productivity, offsetting to some extent the negative effect on &
l
potential GDP from the lower population. Taking into account general e
v
equilibrium effects would further complicate the analysis. Of particular interest e
D
might be how changes in immigration policy affect capital investment, new firm n
o
creation, and the employment of non-immigrant workers. c
E
c
ti
Finally, it is worth noting that a change in immigration policy would likely have, at e s
m
most, a small effect on the aggregate statistics used to measure slack in the
o
economy. While labor force participation rates and unemployment rates among D
the foreign-born population differ somewhat from those of the native-born
population, these differences are sufficiently small that a modest change in
immigration would not generate large differences in these aggregate statistics.

¾ percentage point above the rates observed through 2014. We anticipate this
12-month change will pick up to 2.9 percent over the next couple of months.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3.4 percent
in March, below its recent highs but noticeably above the pace seen a few
years ago.
 Business-sector CPH is currently estimated to have increased 3¼ percent in
2016—again, up from the rates that were typical of a few years ago. We
expect CPH growth to edge up to 3½ percent by 2019 as the labor market
tightens further.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 In the longer run, we continue to assume a growth rate of potential GDP of
1.7 percent. The natural rate of unemployment has been revised down from
5.0 percent to 4.9 percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by the end of 2021.
 With output above its potential and inflation slightly higher than the
Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about
1 percentage point above its long-run value of 3 percent in 2021 and then
moves back toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
We estimate that total foreign growth edged up to nearly 3 percent in the first
quarter instead of the step-down that we had envisaged in the March Tealbook. Although
this pickup is mostly driven by stronger-than-expected activity in Brazil, Canada, and
China, PMIs and trade data from many other advanced and emerging market economies
have also been more upbeat than we had expected. Moreover, surprisingly robust
demand in China led its first-quarter real GDP growth to exceed 7 percent. That said, we
continue to expect foreign growth to moderate to 2½ percent by the third quarter, largely
k
reflecting a deceleration of activity in Canada to a more sustainable pace. We expect o
o
l
foreign growth to remain at about 2½ percent—close to potential—through 2019 as a t
u
O
pickup in Latin America roughly offsets a slight moderation in growth elsewhere. &
l
e
v
e
Altogether, we have revised up our estimate for growth abroad in the first half D
n
about ¼ percentage point. Our forecast is little changed after that. After having o
c
E
consistently marked down our forecast for foreign growth in 2017 during the past two
l
’
t
n
years, we are encouraged that our forecast is now up relative to late last year. I
Headline inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) jumped to an
annual rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter from 1¾ percent in the fourth. This jump
largely reflected pass-through from higher energy prices and currency depreciation to
retail energy prices. AFE inflation falls back to 1½ percent by midyear as these effects
wane before beginning to edge up toward authorities’ 2 percent inflation target. In our
baseline forecast, economic recovery and an improved inflation outlook should lead AFE
central banks to begin the slow process of dialing back their monetary stimulus later in
the forecast period, with Canada moving first in early 2018. But overall, monetary policy
remains generally accommodative.
Inflation in the emerging market economies (EMEs) stepped up to 3½ percent in
the first quarter, as a steep increase in Mexican inflation more than offset a sharp drop in
food prices in China. The acceleration of prices in Mexico largely reflected the effects of
past currency depreciation and large hikes in fuel prices. As these pressures fade, and
given considerable policy tightening by the Bank of Mexico, we see Mexican inflation
beginning to ease toward the 3 percent inflation target later this year.

The encouraging tone of the recent data—particularly sentiment and survey
indicators—highlights upside risks to foreign economic activity. A stronger pickup in
activity abroad could lead to an aggressive removal of monetary stimulus. We explore
the consequences of such an outcome in the alternative scenario “Stronger Foreign
Growth and Tighter Policy” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
That said, downside risks to the outlook remain. Among the geopolitical risks we
are monitoring—including North Korea, Syria, and Turkey—the upcoming elections in
France, where two anti-EU candidates have been polling strongly, figure prominently.
We continue to be concerned about the persistent buildup of debt in China and the
k
o possibility of a financial crisis. U.S. policy normalization could also generate financial
o
l
u t strains in some EMEs if rising U.S. rates and an appreciating dollar increase dollar debt
O
& burdens. We consider an alternative scenario along these lines, “EME Turbulence and
l
e Stronger Dollar,” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.

l
’
n t • Canada. Following rapid growth of 3¼ percent in the second half of 2016, recent
I
indicators, such as the monthly GDP for January and the manufacturing PMI through
March, suggest that real GDP grew a solid 3 percent last quarter, ¾ percentage point
more than what we had in the March Tealbook. Household demand was unusually
strong as a result of a temporary boost from the Canada Child Benefit program, and
investment in the oil and gas sector resumed after a long period of steep declines. We
expect growth to average around 2 percent over the rest of this year and edge down
further to its 1¾ percent rate of potential growth by mid-2018. Growth will continue
to be supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.
• Euro Area. Recent data suggest that first-quarter GDP growth was just below
2 percent, the same pace as in the fourth quarter. We project that GDP growth will
edge down to 1¾ percent this quarter and remain there over the forecast period,
supported by accommodative monetary policy. The forecast for the remainder of
2017 is a touch higher than in the March Tealbook, as strong survey indicators
suggest slightly greater momentum than previously anticipated. With support for
anti-EU candidates elevated in several countries, including in France, where the two
rounds of the presidential election will be held on April 23 and May 7, an escalation
of fears about the future of the currency union remains a significant downside risk to
the outlook.

Inflation jumped to 3 percent in the first quarter from 1.9 percent in the fourth,
pushed up by higher energy and food prices. With core inflation running around
1 percent and projected to creep up to only 1½ percent by 2018, we still expect the
European Central Bank (ECB) to remove accommodation very gradually. We see the
ECB beginning to taper its asset purchases over the first half of 2018 and ceasing
these purchases by the middle of the year. But we now have the ECB raising its
deposit rate at the beginning rather than at the end of 2019. As a result, we see the
deposit rate, currently negative 0.40 percent, touching zero by the end of 2019. This
slightly less accommodative stance of monetary policy importantly reflects our
response to more hawkish communications by some ECB policymakers that suggest
k
o
less patience in removing stimulus as inflation rises. o
l
t
u
O
• United Kingdom. We have real GDP growth slowing to 2 percent in the first quarter &
l
from 2.7 percent in the fourth, in line with some recent weakening in industrial e
v
e
production, services output, and exports. With softer real income growth squeezing D
n
o
consumer demand and with the prospect of reduced trade after Brexit restraining
c
E
investment, we see growth declining further to 1¾ percent by the end of 2017 and to ’ l
t
n
1½ percent thereafter. I
Inflation jumped to 4 percent in the first quarter from 2 percent the quarter before,
mainly as a result of past sterling depreciation. As the exchange rate stabilizes, this
effect should dissipate, and inflation should move back to the Bank of England’s
(BOE) 2 percent target by the end of 2019. We still think that the projected
slowdown in economic growth and sluggish real wage gains will dissuade the BOE
from raising its policy rate before the second half of 2018.
• Japan. Industrial production, manufacturing PMI, and consumer confidence readings
show increased momentum in the Japanese economy, and we have revised up GDP
growth slightly to 1¼ percent in the first half of this year, well above the estimated
½ percent growth rate of potential GDP. We continue to see GDP growth edging
down to 1 percent in 2018 as the output gap closes before growth stalls in 2019 as a
result of a planned consumption tax hike. Economic growth should be supported by
highly accommodative monetary policy. We expect the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to
continue aggressive asset purchases and to keep its deposit rate slightly negative
throughout the forecast period. Inflation is projected to rise from zero in the first
quarter to 1¼ percent by 2019 (excluding the effects of the consumption tax hike), but
to remain well short of the BOJ’s 2 percent target.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. Real GDP growth climbed to 7.1 percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage
point above our March Tealbook estimate. Growth was boosted by a pickup in
manufacturing, partly due to strength in export-oriented industries, consistent with
upbeat export orders and strong imports of high-tech components. Residential real
estate and infrastructure investment also continued to support growth, even as
property prices and sales have begun to cool in the wake of last year’s tighter
macroprudential measures. We took some signal from China’s near-term strength
and revised up growth in the second quarter ½ percentage point to 6½ percent. We
k
o nonetheless still expect growth to slow as the authorities tighten the reins on credit
o
l
t and as potential growth falls, and to settle to a more sustainable pace of 5¾ percent by
u
O
& late 2018. However, we remain concerned about the possibility of a much sharper
l
e adjustment as financial vulnerabilities, especially corporate debt, continue to mount.
v
e
D
n
Headline consumer price inflation fell to negative 0.6 percent in the first quarter from
o
c
E
2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, pulled down by a sharp fall in food prices,
l
’
t
n particularly vegetables. After the influence of these temporary factors fades,
I
consumer price inflation should settle at about 2½ percent by late 2017.
• Other Emerging Asia. Incoming data suggest that real GDP growth in the region
stepped up to 4 percent in the first quarter from 3½ percent in the fourth,
¼ percentage point higher than projected in the previous Tealbook. This step-up is
largely the result of signs that the Indian economy is recovering from the disruptions
suffered during the demonetization drive in late 2017. But growth in several other
countries in the region also picked up, supported by surprisingly robust export
demand. Strength in the region’s exports appears to be coming both from a pickup in
demand for high-tech goods and stronger Chinese demand for commodities. As
Chinese growth slows, we see exports of the region losing some steam with growth in
emerging Asia ex. China declining a bit to 3½ percent by the end of 2017.
• Mexico. Data since the March Tealbook suggest that Mexican growth decelerated to
just under 2 percent in the first quarter from 3 percent in the fourth. We have revised
up our first-quarter estimate ¾ percentage point, as the incoming data have not been
as dire as we had feared at the time of the March Tealbook. Importantly, indicators
for household demand held up, and export growth was solid in the first quarter. We
see Mexican growth gradually moving up to 2½ percent by 2018, supported by the

improved near-term outlook for U.S. manufacturing activity, reduced drag from fiscal
consolidation, and a weaker peso, as well as by past reforms in the energy sector.
Inflation surged to nearly 10 percent in the first quarter, fueled by peso depreciation
and a hike in fuel prices. We see the effects of these developments waning and
inflation declining to near the 3 percent inflation target by 2018. To keep inflationary
pressures at bay, the Bank of Mexico continued to tighten in late March, raising the
policy rate 25 basis points to 6.5 percent, 350 basis points above its level at the start
of its tightening phase in late 2015.
• Brazil. Brazil’s economy likely exited the deepest recession in its history in the first k
o
o
quarter, and we have penciled in first-quarter growth of 2½ percent. Record soybean l
t
u
and corn harvests led exports to skyrocket, driving a surge in the monthly GDP proxy O
&
through February. We expect the export strength to taper off later this year, with l
e
v
Brazil’s recovery then being increasingly underpinned by domestic demand. e
D
n
Consistent with this view, consumer and business confidence readings continued to o
c
E
improve. We nonetheless envision Brazil’s economic recovery to be slow and
l
’
t
protracted, with activity restrained by tight monetary policy, household deleveraging, n
I
and lingering investor doubts about whether the government can tackle the country’s
fiscal and structural problems.
Amid double-digit unemployment and tight monetary policy, inflation fell to
4.6 percent in March on a 12-month basis, just above the government’s target. This
decline, coupled with still-weak economic activity, led the Brazilian central bank to
slash its policy rate 100 basis points in mid-April to 11.25 percent.

Financial Market Developments
Treasury yields declined and the dollar depreciated over the intermeeting period,
apparently driven by investor expectations for a slower pace of policy rate increases
following FOMC communications after the March meeting, waning investor optimism
about the prospect of more expansive fiscal policies, and adverse geopolitical
developments. Risky asset prices were little changed on net.
 Based on a straight read of market quotes, investors continued to attach near-
zero probability to an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at
the May meeting, while the probability of an increase at the June meeting was
little changed at 54 percent. Market-based expectations of the level of the
federal funds rate for early 2018 through the end of 2020 declined about 15 to
45 basis points.
 Results from private surveys suggested that market participants pulled
forward their modal expectations for when the FOMC will start normalizing
the size of its balance sheet. The effect of this change on asset prices
appeared to be fairly limited.
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities with maturities of 5 years and 10 years
s

e
declined 36 basis points. For the most part, these declines reflected lower real k

 Broad U.S. equity price indexes were little changed, on net, while bank equity Fi
indexes declined a fair bit. Near-term option-implied stock price volatility
increased to its highest level since the U.S. elections in November but
remained near the middle of its range over the past few years. Corporate bond
spreads were little changed on net.
 In the AFEs, sovereign benchmark yields declined, while major equity
indexes were mixed. EME equity prices generally rose.
 The broad dollar index declined about 1¾ percent.

 U.S. overnight market interest rates fully incorporated the FOMC’s March
rate increase, and conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable.
Quarter-end dynamics were, for the most part, typical of recent non-year-end
quarter-ends.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
On net, FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were reportedly
interpreted as indicating a somewhat slower pace of policy rate increases but an earlier
date of potential changes to the Committee’s reinvestment policy than investors had
expected. Although the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal
funds rate at the March meeting was widely anticipated, some of the accompanying
communications were interpreted as more accommodative than expected. In particular,
market participants highlighted the fact that the Committee’s median SEP projections for
the federal funds rate for 2017 and 2018 were unchanged from December, while some
investors had reportedly anticipated an upward revision following strong economic data
releases and Federal Reserve communications in early March signaling additional near-
term rate increases.
Subsequently, investors reportedly took note of the mention in the March FOMC
minutes that “most participants . . . judged that a change to the Committee’s reinvestment
s
t
policy would likely be appropriate later this year,” and some market participants e
k
r
a
appeared to have pulled forward their modal expectation for when the FOMC will either M
announce or start to implement a change to its reinvestment policy. For example, in a l
ci
n
response to one recent survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal, nearly 70 percent of
a
n
the participants reported expecting the FOMC to begin normalizing its balance sheet in Fi
2017, up from around 20 percent from the same survey last month. Market participants
also highlighted the statement in the minutes that FOMC participants generally preferred
to phase out or cease reinvestments of “both Treasury securities and agency MBS.”
Overall, market reaction over the intermeeting period to news related to potential
reinvestment policy changes appeared to be fairly limited.
Based on a straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts, the
probability of the next rate increase occurring at the June meeting was little changed at
54 percent. The expected path of the federal funds rate further out through the end of
2020, implied by a straight read from OIS quotes, rotated down by up to 47 basis points

on net. However, a staff model suggested that more negative term premiums accounted
for about half of this decline.
Yields on intermediate- and longer-maturity nominal Treasury securities were
about 36 basis points lower over the intermeeting period, with a more-accommodative-
than-expected interpretation of the FOMC communications, the reduced outlook for
domestic fiscal and regulatory policy changes, and geopolitical developments all placing
downward pressure on yields. In particular, Treasury yields fell noticeably following the
March FOMC meeting and on the news of the canceled vote on the American Health
Care Act (AHCA), with the latter reportedly raising investor uncertainty about the
Administration’s ability to implement its broader economic policy agenda. Geopolitical
developments, including increased uncertainty about the outcome of the French elections
and tensions surrounding North Korea, reportedly also weighed on yields later in the
period.1 Meanwhile, Treasury yields exhibited only limited reaction to domestic
economic data releases, which came in slightly weaker than investors expected on net.
The staff’s term structure model attributed about one-third of the decline in the 10-year
yield to a decrease in the average expected future short rate and the remaining two-thirds
to a lower term premium. Both components remained above their levels prior to the
November elections. One-year-ahead option-implied volatility on 10-year swap rates—
an indicator of uncertainty about future Treasury yields—was little changed over the
intermeeting period. In contrast, one-month-ahead option-implied volatility rose sharply,
once the expiration of these option contracts extended beyond the date of the upcoming t s

The 5-to-10-year forward measures of inflation compensation also edged lower over the
same period. MBS yields fell in line with comparable-maturity Treasury yields.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes have been little changed, on net, since the March
FOMC meeting despite the drop in interest rates, as investors reportedly became less
optimistic about the prospects of tax and regulatory reforms. Share prices of firms in the
financial sector decreased a fair bit, while those of firms in the utilities and real estate

sectors, which tend to benefit more than some other sectors from lower interest rates,
increased somewhat. One-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500
index—the VIX—increased to its highest level since the U.S. elections in November,
likely reflecting concerns about increased geopolitical risks, although it remained near the
middle of its range over the past few years. Over the intermeeting period, spreads of
yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over
comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed on net. Private-sector
analysts continued to project robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over 2017 even as
first-quarter earnings were estimated to be a bit lower relative to the fourth quarter on a
seasonally adjusted basis.
Equity prices of the six largest bank holding companies (BHCs) declined around
9 percent over the intermeeting period, partly reversing their large post-election gains,
amid mixed earnings reports and reduced investor expectations for the Administration’s
tax and regulatory reforms. CDS spreads for the top six BHCs ticked up a bit but still
remained below their pre-election levels.
Foreign Developments
Since the March FOMC meeting, movements in foreign financial markets have
been driven by changes in investors’ perceptions about future U.S. fiscal policy, central
bank communications in the United States and abroad, and geopolitical risks.
s
t
e
During the intermeeting period, 10-year sovereign yields declined across all of the k
r
a
advanced economies. Dovish communication from ECB officials, along with slightly M
l
lower-than-expected euro-area inflation, pushed German 10-year yields down 20 basis a
ci
n
points. Concerns about the outcome of the French presidential elections contributed to a a
n
Fi
slight widening of French sovereign spreads and led to a notable increase in the cost of
insuring against a euro depreciation relative to a euro appreciation. In the United
Kingdom, weaker-than-expected activity data contributed to a 16 basis point decline in
10-year gilt yields. On March 29, the U.K. government formally invoked Article 50,
beginning the process of negotiating the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. This
event was widely anticipated, and it resulted in little price action. Later in the period,
U.K. Prime Minister May called for early parliamentary elections on June 8, seeking to
gain a larger majority for the Conservative Party ahead of the Brexit negotiations.
Increased tensions in Syria and in the Korean peninsula reportedly also contributed to the
decline in AFE yields later in the period.

The broad dollar index declined 1¾ percent, with most of the decline occurring in
the week following the March FOMC meeting. The dollar also depreciated after the
cancellation of the vote on the AHCA, which reportedly damped expectations for
expansionary U.S. fiscal policy. Among AFE currencies over the period, the dollar
depreciated about 5 percent against the yen amid concerns about geopolitical
developments and consistent with U.S. yields declining substantially more than Japanese
yields. The dollar also depreciated 5¼ percent against sterling, with much of the decline
occurring after the call for early elections in the United Kingdom.
Major equity indexes in the AFEs were mixed, and measures of implied volatility
rose sharply. Share prices rose slightly in the euro area, supported by strong
manufacturing PMI data. In Japan, the stronger yen weighed on equity prices.
Investor sentiment toward the emerging market economies (EMEs) continued to
be positive amid strong data on activity and low rates in advanced economies. EME
equity prices generally rose, flows to EME mutual funds remained strong, and EME
currencies appreciated against the dollar. Notably, the Mexican peso appreciated about
4½ percent against the dollar and is now near its level prior to the U.S. presidential
election. EME sovereign bond spreads were little changed over the period.

The reduction in Treasury bill supply prior to the end of the debt limit suspension
period on March 15 pushed overnight secured money market rates to the lower end of the
target range and led to an increase in ON RRP take-up.2 As net bill issuance picked up
again beginning on March 16, overnight secured spreads to the ON RRP rate widened
slightly and ON RRP take-up declined.
2 Legislation passed in 2015 suspended the debt limit through March 15, 2017, at which point the
debt limit of the United States was reset at the amount of debt outstanding on that date. On March 16, the
Treasury Department began using extraordinary measures that would likely keep the debt from breaching
the limit through the fall.

Quarter-end dynamics in overnight money markets largely followed the pattern of
recent non-year-end quarter-ends. One exception was Eurodollar volumes, which
displayed a more gradual and less pronounced decline ahead of quarter-end instead of the
usual sharp one-day drop. At the March quarter-end, ON RRP take-up increased
$123 billion from the prior day to $347 billion, in line with recent non-year-end quarter-
ends.
Abroad, quarter-end dynamics in most foreign money markets were generally
orderly. Very short-term FX swap bases widened, but not as much as during recent
quarter ends, and the bases quickly returned to levels closer to recent norms. There were
modest take-ups of dollar auctions at the Bank of Japan and the ECB.
Conditions in other short-term funding markets were also stable over the
intermeeting period. Reflecting the March rate increase, net yields on money market
funds (MMFs) rose. Total outstanding levels of commercial paper, certificates of
deposit, and assets under management of MMFs remained about unchanged.
Following the large deposit outflows induced by the mid-October MMF reform,
large time deposits and core deposits at foreign banks increased in the first quarter.
Domestic banks experienced some large time deposit outflows in early 2017, while core
deposit inflows remained stable.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households have been
roughly unchanged, on net, in recent months and have continued to be supportive of
economic activity. Nevertheless, the overall pace of financing of large businesses picked
up in the first quarter but remained modest compared with the very strong pace seen early
last year. Overall household debt growth also continued to be modest.
 Market-based lending to large nonfinancial firms remained solid, with
particularly strong investment-grade bond issuance and a pickup in bond
issuance by lower-rated firms. By contrast, bank loan growth slowed
noticeably, apparently driven by a weakening in the demand for commercial
and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans.
 Credit continued to be largely available for small businesses, although the
demand for credit by these firms reportedly remained weak.
 Financing conditions for households continued to be accommodative on
balance. Growth of consumer loans moderated but remained relatively strong,
while demand for residential real estate loans was little changed amid still-
tight lending conditions for households with lower credit scores or harder-to-
document incomes.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporate Debt and Equity
Over the intermeeting period, financing conditions for large nonfinancial firms
stayed accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate bonds remained strong in March,
reflecting robust issuance by investment-grade firms. In addition, issuance by lower-
rated firms picked up, with a large share of the proceeds reportedly earmarked for
refinancing existing debt. Gross equity issuance by large nonfinancial firms was also

Net debt financing to nonfinancial businesses increased in the first quarter but
remained noticeably below the pace of early 2016. Net debt financing was particularly
weak during the second half of 2016, led by softer C&I loan growth and bond issuance
net of retirements. While bond issuance rebounded in the first quarter to its pace of early
2016, C&I lending continued to be soft last quarter.
According to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending
Practices (SLOOS), both foreign and domestic banks reported weaker demand for C&I
loans, on net, in the first quarter.1 Regarding their credit policies on such loans, banks
reportedly left standards for approving C&I loans unchanged; however, they have eased
several loan terms, including loan rate spreads and covenants for large and middle-market
firms, citing more aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as an
important reason for doing so. (Nonbank lenders appear to have increased lending to
medium-sized firms with limited access to corporate bond markets; see the box “Direct-
Lending Investment Funds: The ‘New Kid’ in Middle-Market Lending.”) Of note, the
recent slowdown in C&I loan growth was attributed in part to loan paydowns at large
domestic and foreign banks, two types of institutions that tend to serve large firms with
access to the institutional leveraged loan and corporate bond markets.
Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans was quite strong last quarter;
however, with the majority of those loans reportedly being used for refinancing purposes,
net issuance continued to be fairly light. Refinancing activity was boosted by favorable
financing conditions, as evidenced by continued strong inflows to leveraged loan mutual
funds and tight spreads on newly issued loans. These developments partly reflected
institutional investors’ strong demand for floating-rate loans given expectations of further
increases in short-term interest rates.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for CRE were broadly unchanged on net. Commercial

Direct-Lending Investment Funds:
The “New Kid” in Middle-Market Lending
A new class of nonbank lenders to middle-market firms has emerged since the financial crisis—the
so-called direct-lending investment funds, or direct-lending funds. Middle-market firms—medium-
sized firms with revenue roughly between $10 million and $1 billion—reportedly account for nearly
one-third of U.S. private-sector GDP and employment.1 Many middle-market firms do not have
access to corporate bond markets and struggle to borrow from institutional leveraged loan
investors such as loan mutual funds or issuers of collateralized loan obligations. As a result, middle-
market businesses have historically relied mainly on commercial banks for credit. Since the
financial crisis, however, new direct-lending investment funds have carved out a sizable and
growing niche to meet the demand for credit from medium-sized firms.2
Direct-lending funds are sponsored by private equity firms and alternative asset managers.3 These
funds raise capital from institutional investors including foundations, endowments, pensions, high-
net-worth individuals, and sovereign wealth funds. Investors commit capital for the life of each
fund, which usually lasts close to 10 years. Investors are compensated for the long lockup periods
with relatively high yields, a business model that is particularly attractive to institutional investors,
which tend to reach for yield in a low interest rate environment. These nonbank loans are
attractive to many medium-sized firms despite higher costs because they would not otherwise
receive enough financing from traditional banks, particularly at longer maturities.
Figure 1 shows an estimate of the total amount of capital deployed by direct-lending funds annually
since 2008. These funds deployed $32 billion to medium-sized firms over the past four years—with
individual deal sizes typically not exceeding $1 billion—of a total of at least $35 billion raised from
investors over that time.4 As of the end of 2016, these funds are estimated to have had nearly
$10 billion of uncalled capital (or “dry powder”) available to be deployed in future deals (figure 2).
The increasing presence of these nonbank lenders has coincided with publicly traded middle-
market firms’ growing appetite for credit.5 Of these firms, those without a long-term bond rating
increased their long-term debt $78 billion over the past four years, as shown in figure 3, a period
during which direct-lending funds deployed over $30 billion, suggesting that this new class of
nonbank lenders has become a nontrivial supplier of credit to the middle-market segment of the
corporate sector.6 In addition, a growing fraction of these firms newly entered long-term debt
1 These statistics have been compiled by the National Center for the Middle Market,
www.middlemarketcenter.org.
2 Goldman Sachs noted in a March 29, 2013 SEC filing that it “believes [middle-market companies] have been
underserved in recent years by banks and have difficulty accessing the public debt markets.”
3 Examples of alternative asset managers include hedge funds, various debt strategy funds, and real asset
funds.
4 KKR provided loans of close to $1 billion to Mills Fleet Farm Group for an acquisition when it otherwise could
not acquire financing.
5 In this analysis, middle-market firms are defined as nonfinancial firms with three-year rolling average annual
revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.
6 Because loan holdings are not separated from bond holdings in the data, the analysis excludes firms with
long-term bond ratings, which account for about 5 percent of these 2,000 firms, to get a more accurate
measurement of loan holdings.

markets in recent years. According to figure 4, close to 6 percent of these firms started to carry
long-term debt on their books between 2011 and 2015; in sharp contrast, less than 1 percent of their
non-middle-market counterparts started to carry long-term debt during this period.7
While the analysis is limited to public firms because of data availability, it has a broad application, as
publicly traded firms constitute about half of nonfinancial domestic firms in terms of total assets.8
In addition, the trend in credit demand is likely to hold for private firms as well: Direct-lending
funds are likely more important for private firms because such firms generally are smaller, are more
financially constrained, and have a narrower spectrum of credit sources.
Taken together, recent developments indicate that direct-lending funds are becoming an
important source of funding for middle-market firms, which appear to have increasing demand for
credit. These nonbank lenders, which typically extend longer-term loans than commercial banks,
add to the pool of long-term liquidity for middle-market firms, helping them diversify their sources
of credit and possibly become less dependent on bank-intermediated credit.

the adoption of the risk-retention rule in late December caused some issuance to be
shifted from January and February into the fourth quarter. CRE loan growth on banks’
books slowed in the first quarter but continued to be robust overall. Domestic
respondents to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their lending standards and
seeing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories during the first quarter.
Small Businesses
Overall, since the March Tealbook, indicators point to credit market conditions
for small businesses having improved somewhat. Data from the most recent Wells
Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index survey indicated that credit supply eased somewhat
from already accommodative levels, although results from the April SLOOS suggested
that demand for credit among small businesses weakened over the first quarter.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) index of small business
optimism, which rose sharply following the November elections, remained elevated at
levels last observed in 2004, likely reflecting expected changes in the regulatory and tax
environment under the new Administration. This optimism has not translated into
stronger loan demand from small businesses thus far; anecdotal evidence points to small
business bank deposits that are near record-high levels, which might be suppressing
demand for credit. Indicators of recent small business loan performance have remained
strong, and credit quality concerns are not expected to constrain the growth of small
business credit going forward.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on
balance, and gross issuance of bonds by state and local governments was solid in March.
Since the March FOMC meeting, yields on 20-year municipal bonds moved down
roughly in line with the decline in comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving their
ratios over Treasury yields little changed on net. On balance, the credit quality of state
and local governments appeared to improve further, as the number of ratings upgrades

continued to outpace the number of downgrades in March. n

HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over
the intermeeting period, as credit availability continued to be relatively tight for
households with low credit scores or harder-to-document incomes. Mortgage rates
declined in line with yields on longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed
securities, but they remained elevated relative to the third quarter of 2016. Consistent
with these developments, refinance originations have slowed considerably since the third
quarter. In the April SLOOS, banks reported roughly unchanged standards on residential
real estate loans on average; that said, they reported a tightening of standards on non-QM
(non-qualified mortgage) loans and an easing of standards on GSE-eligible (government-
sponsored enterprise-eligible) and government loans. Banks also reported that demand
for GSE-eligible and government loans weakened during the first quarter. In line with
lower reported demand, residential real estate lending at banks declined.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative over
the past few months on balance. Growth in consumer loan balances moderated a bit
further from the relatively strong pace seen during the past few years, although year-over-
year growth in credit card balances, student loans, and auto loans stayed in the 6 to 7
percent range through February. Consumer credit appeared to be broadly available, even
as interest rates charged on credit card balances and new auto loans drifted up in line with
their benchmark shorter-term interest rates. In the April SLOOS, banks reported that
they had tightened standards on credit card and auto loans, on net, while noting that they
had experienced little change in the demand for consumer loans on the whole.
New issuance of consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) picked up over the first
quarter and was quite strong in March. Some lenders appeared to have stepped up their
issuance of credit card ABS, likely reflecting the tight interest rate spreads on such
securities.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS nn cc
UU
&&
As in the March Tealbook, we see the uncertainty around our forecast of ss
kk
ss
economic activity as being somewhat greater than it was before the recent U.S. elections RRii
but still in line with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the
FOMC). We based this judgment largely on a view that greater uncertainty prevails
about the future direction of government policy. Empirical indexes of uncertainty are
mixed: The Baker, Bloom, and Davis index of economic policy uncertainty remains at a
higher level than in the months before the elections, but options-based indexes of
expected stock market volatility (such as the VIX) and corporate bond spreads remain at
subdued levels.
We continue to judge the risks to our medium-term GDP projection as tilted to the
downside, primarily because monetary policy is likely better positioned to offset large
positive shocks than substantial adverse ones. (For more discussion of this downside
risk, see the box “A Guidepost for Dropping Effective Lower Bound Risk from the
Assessment of Risks.”) Nevertheless, we see the downward skew as less pronounced
than it was late last year, reflecting both that risks to the foreign outlook have subsided
somewhat and that consumer and business confidence in the United States has moved up.
We see the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP
and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.
With regard to inflation, we do not think that the current level of uncertainty is
unusually high. We see important risks to inflation on both the downside and the upside,
and we consider those risks to be roughly balanced. To the downside, some survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at relatively low levels. In
addition, U.S. monetary policy normalization could generate a greater appreciation of the
dollar than we have anticipated in the baseline forecast, as is illustrated in one of the
alternative scenarios. To the upside, with the economy projected to be operating above
its long-run potential, inflation may increase more than the staff expects, consistent with
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation,
another possibility that is explored in one of the alternative scenarios.

UUU The staff has, for some time, judged that the risks to the projection for real activity are
&&& skewed to the downside due to the effective lower bound (ELB) constraint on the federal
sss
kkk funds rate. All else being equal, a higher expected path for the federal funds rate lowers
sss
RRRiii
the probability that policymakers will be constrained by the ELB in the near future, which
reduces downside macroeconomic risks. With the federal funds rate having risen to the
range of ¾ to 1 percent and expected to rise further going forward, we will face a
decision about when to drop the ELB reference from the Tealbook’s assessment of risks.
In this discussion, we describe how one specific measure of ELB risk has evolved since
liftoff and is expected to evolve in the future. We then lay out one possible way to use
this measure to inform our decision on when to drop our reference to the downside
economic risk stemming from the ELB.
Figure 1 shows a measure of ELB risk—the probability that the federal funds rate will be
at the ELB for at least one quarter during the next three years—computed from 20,000
stochastic simulations of FRB/US around the Tealbook baseline projection using the non‐
inertial version of the Taylor rule.1 According to figure 1, the ELB risk measure was above
30 percent throughout 2016 but then moved below 30 percent early this year. The ELB
risk measure based on the April 2017 Tealbook projection is 26 percent.2
1 We use the non‐inertial Taylor rule to capture the fact that policymakers typically cut interest rates
aggressively in the face of a looming recession, even though they often increase interest rates gradually
in the aftermath of a recession. In sticky‐price models that account for the ELB, this asymmetric
behavior is consistent with the prescription of optimal commitment policy and other well‐performing
rules, such as the price‐level targeting rule and the rule proposed in David Reifschneider and John C.
Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low‐Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and
Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936–66.
2 In the stochastic simulation, many of the ELB episodes are short lived, with the federal funds rate
touching the ELB in only one or two quarters. According to the April 2017 Tealbook projection, the
probability that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least four quarters (not necessarily
consecutive) during the next three years is about 10 percent.

Note that ELB risk fluctuated during 2016 even though the actual federal funds rate yy
tt
remained constant in the range of ¼ to ½ percent. These movements reflect the fact nn
aaii
that the ELB risk measure depends not only on the current federal funds rate, but also on rr tt
ee
the projected path of the federal funds rate. When the projected path of the federal cc
nn
UU
funds rate becomes flatter (steeper), ELB risk increases (decreases). For example, when
&&
the staff reduced its estimate of the long‐run equilibrium value of the federal funds ss
kk
rate—the intercept in the Taylor rule—in the June 2016 Tealbook projection, the ss
RRii
projected path of the federal funds rate flattened appreciably. As a result, the ELB risk
increased, from about 31 percent in April 2016 to more than 34 percent in June 2016.
Figure 2 shows the projected path of the ELB risk according to the current Tealbook
forecast. In this figure, the ELB risk at any given date shows the model‐implied
probability that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least one quarter during
the subsequent three years if the economy has evolved according to the current
Tealbook projection up to that time. Because the federal funds rate is expected to rise,
ELB risk is expected to decline further from its current level. It declines even below its
steady‐state value of 18 percent—shown by the dashed line—reflecting the projected
overshooting of the federal funds rate above its long‐run value of 3 percent.3 Indeed, as
a result of the forward‐looking nature of the ELB risk measure, the ELB risk is expected to
decline below its steady‐state value in early 2018, when the federal funds rate is still
expected to be substantially below its long‐run value of 3 percent.
We plan to consult this ELB risk measure to inform our decision about when to drop the
ELB reference in our assessment of risks in the Tealbook. Our provisional plan is to stop
highlighting the ELB risk sometime after our measure of ELB risk is below 25 percent. The
choice of 25 percent is somewhat arbitrary, and others may see a different threshold level
as more appropriate. As can be seen in figure 2, according to the April Tealbook
projection, the ELB risk measure is likely to dip below 25 percent for the first time in
2017:Q3, when the federal funds rate is projected to be a little above 1 percent. The date
when this measure moves below 25 percent will depend on the actual evolution of the
economy as well as the evolution of the staff projection. If the federal funds rate rises
more slowly or the staff projection of the funds rate path becomes flatter than
anticipated by the current Tealbook projection—possibly because the staff further
lowers its estimate of the long‐run equilibrium natural rate—the threshold will be
breached later than 2017:Q3.
3 The steady‐state value of the ELB risk is the model‐implied probability that the federal funds rate
will be at the ELB for at least one quarter during the next three years, conditional on the economy being
at its steady state today. This concept is distinct from the unconditional probability that the federal
funds rate is at the ELB. To compute the steady‐state ELB risk shown in figure 2, we begin stochastic
simulations from a steady state consistent with that shown in the Long‐Term Outlook exhibit of the April
Tealbook projection.

Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
yy
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities in the U.S. tt
nn
aaii
financial system as moderate. The rise in asset prices in equity and commercial real tt
rr

estate markets since the previous QS assessment, coupled with a further narrowing of nn cc
UU
corporate bond spreads, points to notable and increasing valuation pressures. But the &&
ss
stability implications of these valuation pressures are counterbalanced by a number of kk
ss
RRii
factors. First, the evidently high appetite for risk suggested by stretched valuations has
not as of yet led to increased borrowing in the nonfinancial sector, leaving vulnerabilities
associated with leverage at a moderate level. Moreover, vulnerabilities from leverage in
the financial system continue to be low, owing, in part, to bank capital ratios that are high
by historical standards. Finally, vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity
transformation remain low. Liquidity coverage ratios for all large domestic bank holding
companies are above regulatory requirements. Last year’s reforms have, to date, reduced
run risk in money market funds. Adjustments in short-term funding markets in response
to these reforms are, however, still ongoing, and run risks have the potential to reemerge.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario explores the
consequences of a stronger response of wages to labor market slack and a more
pronounced reaction of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation. The second
scenario presents an economy in which the path of the interest rate and equity prices are
both lower, leaving the equity premium wider and relieving valuation pressures
somewhat. The third scenario illustrates the possible economic consequences of a broad
policy disappointment in which consumer, business, and investor expectations deteriorate
markedly as the anticipated fiscal expansion and reduction in regulatory burdens do not
materialize. In the fourth and fifth scenarios, we assume a lower natural rate of
unemployment, both without and with policymakers’ misperceptions about the level of
the natural rate. In the sixth scenario, we consider the possibility that U.S. monetary
policy normalization leads to emerging market turbulence and a much stronger
appreciation of the dollar. The last scenario analyzes the effects of stronger foreign
economic growth in combination with a faster normalization of monetary policy in
the AFEs.

Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and More Sensitive Long-Run Inflation
Ri
Expectations (simulated with FRB/US)
Despite tight labor and product markets in the Tealbook baseline, core PCE price
inflation is projected to pick up only slowly over the medium term, reaching 2 percent in
2019. This outlook is consistent with the relatively muted sensitivity of inflation to
economic slack that has characterized recent experience and with tightly anchored long-
run inflation expectations—features that are also present in the FRB/US model. A
natural way to generate larger responses in inflation from the state of economic
conditions in the FRB/US model is to loosen these assumptions. In this scenario, we
postulate that wages (and therefore, in FRB/US, prices) become more sensitive to labor
market slack and long-run inflation expectations become more sensitive to realized
inflation.2
Under these circumstances, inflation increases to 2½ percent by 2019 and is close
to 3 percent by 2022. To counteract higher inflation, the federal funds rate increases
more rapidly than in the baseline, reaching 3¾ percent by the end of 2019 and 4¾ percent
at the end of 2022, about ¾ percentage point higher than in the baseline projection. As a
consequence of slightly higher longer-term real interest rates, real GDP growth is a bit
slower and the trajectory for the unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher by the
end of 2022.
Lower Valuation Pressures (FRB/US)
In the baseline forecast, equity prices edge up a little further and the 10-year
Treasury yield rises relatively steeply, reflecting both the ongoing increase in short rates
1 The models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy, and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.
2 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the
current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of the increase reflects a comparison between
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

kk
ss
RRii
In this scenario, we explore the possible consequences of those valuation
pressures being relieved somewhat. In particular, we assume that the 10-year Treasury
term premium increases 30 basis points less than in the baseline (and, hence, the 10-year
Treasury yield does likewise). This lower trajectory for longer-term interest rates is more
consistent with current market expectations. Importantly, we assume that the lower term
premium reflects weaker demand conditions; thus, the lower trajectory for the Treasury
yield does not provide any incremental support for economic activity. We also assume a
gradual decline of 5 percent in equity prices rather than the small increase built into the
staff forecast. Under these alternative conditions, the equity premium is 75 basis points
higher than in the baseline by the end of 2019, bringing market valuations more in
balance with the strength of the economy projected in the baseline.3 However, in the
model simulation, the implications of these financial changes for real economic activity
and inflation are slight, partly because the decline in equity prices is smooth and gradual
(reaching 5 percent relative to the baseline only at the end of 2019) and partly because it
has no repercussions for business or household confidence or for the lending capacity of
the financial system.
Broad Policy Disappointment (FRB/US)
In this scenario, we assume that the federal government not only fails to
implement the fiscal expansion assumed in the baseline, but also is unable for the most
part to enact other policies that financial markets may have priced in, such as an easing of
regulatory burdens.4 Moreover, this scenario assumes that the staff has not fully
appreciated the positive effects of more buoyant consumer and business sentiment on
spending in the baseline projection. As a result, in addition to the restraint on aggregate
3 This upward adjustment in the equity premium brings it near the 25th percentile of its historical
distribution.
4 To be clear, we have not built into the baseline any increment to growth stemming from regulatory
relief. In this scenario, we unwind the adjustments to the rule for setting the federal funds rate and to the
long-term interest rate term premium that were made in the baseline projection to account for the assumed
fiscal expansion.

demand because the fiscal expansion does not materialize, economic activity is also

businesses and financial markets. In particular, the triple-B corporate bond spread rises tt

kk
ss
As a result, real GDP decelerates substantially, growing less than 1½ percent per
RRii
year, on average, during 2018 and 2019, about ½ percentage point less than in the
baseline. The unemployment rate rises slightly from its current level rather than
declining as in the baseline and hovers at around 4¾ percent from 2018 to 2022—close to
its longer-term sustainable level. With the labor market less tight and inflation lower, the
federal funds rate rises more gradually and is about 1 percentage point below the baseline
rate of 3½ percent at the end of 2019.5
Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment (FRB/US)
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate will fall to 4 percent
by the end of 2019, almost 1 percentage point below the staff’s baseline estimate of the
natural rate of unemployment. However, the natural rate is estimated with considerable
uncertainty and could be lower than the staff’s estimate of 4.9 percent. In this scenario,
we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 4 percent for the past few
years and remains at that level in the future.
For purposes of illustration, this scenario unrealistically assumes that
policymakers and the staff are already fully aware of the lower natural rate and have
adjusted their estimate of the unemployment gap downward about 0.9 percentage point at
the beginning of the simulation. Under these conditions, the inertial Taylor rule calls for
a slightly more gradual rise in the federal funds rate, leaving it a bit less than
½ percentage point below the baseline by the end of 2018. (The deviation from the
baseline would be larger with a non-inertial version of the policy rule.) The
unemployment rate falls faster than in the baseline as a result of both the lower natural
5 Without the change in sentiment, the failure to implement the fiscal expansion implies that real
GDP growth is ¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline in 2018 and slightly lower in 2019, while the
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher at the end of 2019. In addition, inflation is a touch lower
than in the baseline. These developments, together with the adjustment to the rule for setting the federal
funds rate, result in a federal funds rate that is ½ percentage point below the baseline at the end of 2020.

misperception), and because output is perceived to be correspondingly above its
potential, the path for the federal funds rate is higher than in the previous scenario—by
about ½ percentage point, on average, in 2019. The tighter stance of policy reduces GDP
growth ¼ percentage point by the end of 2018 compared with the scenario without
misperception. The trajectory of GDP growth is close to the baseline. The
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point above the scenario without misperception by
the end of 2022. The relatively modest effect on real economic activity in this scenario
reflects in large part the relatively low interest rate sensitivity embedded in FRB/US;
hence, simulations with other models could yield results that are less benign. Inflation
runs slightly below the baseline.
EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar (SIGMA)
The reaction of financial markets to the FOMC’s decisions to hike policy rates in
December and March has thus far been quite benign and likely reflects that foreign
growth prospects appear to be on a more solid footing. However, many emerging market
economies, including but not limited to China, have high levels of corporate debt,
sovereign debt, or both, and they remain vulnerable to higher interest rates and currency
depreciation. Accordingly, there is a risk that ongoing U.S. monetary policy
normalization could lead to heightened financial pressures abroad, triggering market
volatility, reduced economic activity, and flight-to-safety flows that further boost the
dollar. In this scenario, we assume that EME corporate borrowing spreads rise
substantially in the face of persistent capital outflows from these economies and that the
broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the middle of 2018. Despite

The stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth depress U.S. real net exports. ss

Consequently, U.S. real GDP growth moderates to 1½ percent in 2018, nearly
RRii
¾ percentage point less than in the baseline. Lower import prices and weaker economic
activity cause core PCE inflation to be below 1½ percent through 2018. The federal
funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, rising to 2½ percent by the end
of 2019.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy (SIGMA)
In our baseline forecast, we expect policy normalization abroad—especially in the
major AFEs—to occur very slowly as headwinds diminish only gradually and central
banks remain attentive to downside risks to activity and inflation. However, a stronger
output expansion than in the baseline could induce foreign central banks to downweight
these risk-management considerations and embark on markedly faster policy tightening.
In this scenario, we assume that foreign GDP growth runs at over 3 percent per year over
2017 and 2018, about 1 percentage point above the baseline, and that the improved
outlook prompts AFE central banks to tighten their policy rates more aggressively than
what is prescribed by the baseline policy rule. The stronger foreign growth, higher
interest rates—including from some rise in term premiums—and reversal of earlier flight-
to-safety flows into U.S. assets contribute to a 10 percent depreciation of the broad real
dollar.
Despite the sharp tightening of monetary policy abroad and some spillovers of
that tightening into U.S. interest rates, U.S. activity benefits as stronger foreign growth
and the weaker dollar boost net exports. U.S. real GDP expands, on average, 2½ percent
in 2017 and 2018, about ¼ percentage point more than in the baseline. The
unemployment rate falls to around 3½ percent by the end of 2019. Higher import prices
and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to move persistently above
2¼ percent in 2018 and 2019. The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the
baseline, increasing to 4 percent by the end of 2019.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from cc

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&&
ss
kk
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals ss
RRii
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with
those in the Tealbook baseline. The prescriptions of simple rules are generally little
different from those in the March Tealbook because the baseline paths for the output gap
and inflation are little changed. The optimal control policy rate paths are somewhat
higher than those in the March Tealbook. This change reflects the staff’s projection of a
slightly larger undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment in coming years with
essentially no change in the staff’s projection for inflation.1 Most simple rules and
optimal control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than
assumed in the staff forecast. In a special exhibit, we examine policy prescriptions and
macroeconomic outcomes under a number of policy rules in a setting in which wages,
and thus prices, are more responsive to labor market tightness than in the FRB/US model.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and
a first-difference rule.2 These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections
for the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels. The top and
middle panels also provide the path for the federal funds rate used in the staff baseline.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor-type policy rules in the second and third
quarters of 2017 are little changed since the March Tealbook.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not feature an interest
rate smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the
near term than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline.
1 The staff revised down its estimate of the natural rate of unemployment 0.1 percentage point and
its projection for the unemployment rate about 0.2 percentage point through the second quarter of 2018 and
about 0.1 percentage point for several years thereafter. As a result, in the Tealbook baseline, the
unemployment rate undershoots its natural rate by a little more than in March.
2 We provide details on each of these four simple rules in the appendix to this section.

"average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same 12−quarter period

• The near-term prescriptions of the first-difference rule are a little higher than
in March, reflecting the staff’s projection of a somewhat faster rise in output
relative to its potential level later this year compared with the projection in the
previous Tealbook.
A MEDIUM-TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model, given
the staff’s baseline projection. This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• The current-quarter estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is 14 basis
points higher than projected in the March Tealbook, reflecting the small
upward revisions to the output gap, while the real federal funds rate path is
little revised.
• At 1.76 percent, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is more than 1 percentage
point above the average projected real federal funds rate in the staff forecast
for the same 12-quarter period and 76 basis points above the staff’s estimate
of the real federal funds rate in the longer run.
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is
below the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction
function assumed by the staff includes an interest rate smoothing term, reacts
to both the output gap and inflation deviations from 2 percent, and does not
insist on closing the output gap over a particular time horizon.
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model under the
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,

specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation

output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows the paths implied by the
different policy rules.4 The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are only slightly
higher than in the March Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revision to the staff’s
projection of the output gap.
• The policy rate path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the
intercept. The federal funds rate increases, on average, about 1 percentage
point per year in 2017 and 2018 and reaches 3 percent in 2019. The pace of
tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 4.1 percent
in 2021 before moving toward its longer-run level of 3 percent.
• The prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a constant intercept
imply a slightly higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years
than the path associated with the Tealbook baseline, which incorporates a
judgmental intercept adjustment. The difference in policy rates arising from
this alternative treatment of the intercept is small and dissipates too rapidly to
have marked effects on the real longer-term interest rates that influence
economic activity in the FRB/US model. Thus, macroeconomic outcomes
under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are similar to those in the Tealbook
baseline.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years. This
initially more rapid tightening of policy is followed by a period extending well
beyond 2022 during which the federal funds rate is lower than in the Tealbook
projection. Under the maintained assumption that market participants have
perfect foresight, the paths for the real 10-year Treasury yield under these two
rules are, on net, not far from that under the Tealbook baseline. Economic
activity in the FRB/US model is tightly linked to the real 10-year Treasury
yield, and thus the differences in the paths for unemployment and inflation
market participants, price setters, and wage setters believe that policymakers will follow through on this
commitment and understand its macroeconomic implications.
4 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

between the two rules are relatively small in relation to the initially large
differences in the paths of the federal funds rate.5
• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower path for
some years thereafter. This divergence occurs because the first-difference
rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its
level, reacts to the projected narrowing of the output gap late in the decade
and beyond. The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2019, in
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflation in the future,
s

M OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.6
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices in a way
that improves current and future economic outcomes.7
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
5 The Taylor (1993) rule calls for slightly lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over the
period shown because it does not respond as strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level
over the next several years. As a consequence, the Taylor (1993) rule generates a lower trajectory for the
unemployment rate and a slightly higher trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor (1999) rule.
6
The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix provides technical
details on the optimal control simulations.
7 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ actions; however, the simulations are not
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

unemployment, and on avoiding changes in the federal funds rate. Under this
strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the
Tealbook baseline policy rate path. This higher path arises because, in the
current baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s
estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that
policymakers with an “Equal weights” loss function judge to be costly. A
tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that is substantially
closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is
somewhat lower than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown,
consistent with a limited response of inflation to lower levels of resource
utilization in the FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below both the path for the case of equal weights and the
Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers
choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate because their
desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this
outcome. Because private agents believe that policymakers will follow this
policy rate path if the economy evolves as projected, the tighter labor market
brings inflation to 2 percent more quickly than in the case of equal weights;
inflation then edges above the Committee’s longer-run objective for the next
decade.8
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
8 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to reoptimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, policy rates and
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook baseline and optimal control under
commitment. For the other three specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under
commitment and discretion are not much different from each other.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative
than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with
undershooting the inflation objective in coming years are larger. The reason
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff
because inflation responds little to resource utilization. Hence, policymakers
would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of
unemployment, which this specification of the loss function sees as costly, in
order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but
is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the resulting
optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster than under the
specification with equal weights in 2017 in an effort to contain the projected
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment and remains around
5½ percent over the remainder of the period shown. The paths for the real
federal funds rate and the real 10-year Treasury yield are also noticeably
higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights. While this
policy leaves the trajectory for inflation almost unaffected, it keeps the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.
• Compared with the March Tealbook, the federal funds rate paths prescribed
by optimal control under each of the four loss functions are one- to
three-tenths of a percentage point higher in the final years of the period
shown, reflecting continued improvements in the labor market and the
modestly higher inflation generated by the tighter labor market later in the
decade. In addition, the simulation “Minimal weight on rate adjustments”
also features a rise in the federal funds rate that is about 70 basis points higher
at the end of 2017 than in the previous Tealbook because policymakers in the
model move aggressively in response to further declines in the unemployment
rate relative to its natural rate.
POLICY RULES PERFORMANCE UNDER A STEEPER WAGE PHILLIPS CURVE
In the FRB/US model, wages and prices are not very responsive to labor market
conditions—a pattern consistent with the behavior of wages and prices during the period

of changing labor market slack over most of the past decade. However, as the labor
market continues to tighten and the unemployment rate moves further below its natural
rate, there is a risk that wages could rise by more than the staff currently assumes, leading
to higher consumer price inflation. In the fourth exhibit, we illustrate how several simple
rules perform under a scenario in which the slope of the wage Phillips curve is four times
the assumed value in the FRB/US model.9 We consider both the inertial and non-inertial
versions of the Taylor (1999) rule, along with a rule for the change in the federal funds
rate (rather than its level).10 The simulations are carried out using the FRB/US model
and represent versions of an alternative scenario that appears in the Risks and Uncertainty
section of this Tealbook.11

10 This “change rule” is specified so that , where is the
federal funds rate, is four-quarter core PCE price inflation, and is the unemployment rate. For an
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1 =1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+2(4.9−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡) 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡
analysis of a similar rule, see John B. Taylor (1999), “The Robustness and Efficiency of Monetary Policy
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡
Rules as Guidelines for Interest Rate Setting by the European Central Bank,” Journal of Monetary
Economics, vol. 43 (June), pp. 655–79. For a recent application, see Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The
Economic Outlook and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research, Stanford University, Stanford, California, January 19,
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170119a.htm. The change rule has different
coefficient values than the first-difference rule shown in the second exhibit and, importantly, it uses the
current deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate and of inflation from 2 percent rather than
expectations about future changes in the output gap and expected deviations of inflation from 2 percent.
All else being equal, the change rule’s focus on absolute deviations, rather than on expected changes, tends
to accentuate tightening and easing cycles relative to the first-difference rule.
11 Unlike the similar alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A, we
do not adjust the way that inflation expectations are formed, but instead isolate the effects of a change in
the policy rule under a steeper wage Phillips curve. Moreover, as in the other simulations in the Monetary
Policy Strategies section of Tealbook A, the simulations are conducted under the assumption that market
participants, as well as price and wage setters, have perfect foresight. By contrast, the alternative scenario
in the Risks and Uncertainty section that considers a steeper wage Phillips curve embeds the assumption
that all expectations are formed using projections based solely on past outcomes.

and, in turn, a somewhat higher unemployment rate than in the Tealbook
baseline.
• Under the Taylor (1999) rule, the federal funds rate rises much more quickly
in response to the higher inflation than under the inertial version of that rule.
As a result, unemployment is initially higher than under the inertial version of
the rule, whereas inflation outcomes are similar.
• The change rule has different properties than Taylor-type rules. For example,
when the unemployment rate is below its natural rate and inflation is above
2 percent, it prescribes continual increases in the federal funds rate at least
until inflation returns to 2 percent or the unemployment rate returns to its
natural rate.12 By contrast, Taylor-type rules would prescribe decreases in the
federal funds rate as inflation declines to 2 percent and the unemployment rate
rises toward its natural rate.13
• In the Tealbook baseline, core PCE price inflation is somewhat below
2 percent in the current and subsequent quarters; however, the unemployment
rate is currently 0.4 percentage point below its natural rate and projected to
fall further. On net, the change rule calls for increases to the federal funds
rate until the unemployment rate has almost risen to its natural rate. The
prescribed policy rate path remains above the prescriptions of the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule from the second half of 2018 through 2022, leading to a
more rapid return of the unemployment rate to its natural level and keeping
inflation at or below 2 percent through 2022 despite the steeper wage Phillips
curve.
• In sum, the model simulations indicate that both the Taylor (1999) rule and
the inertial version of that rule would lead to a persistent overshooting of the
Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective if wages turn out to be more
12 Similarly, if the unemployment rate is above its natural rate and inflation is below 2 percent, the
change rule will prescribe decreases in the federal funds rate until inflation returns to 2 percent or the
unemployment rate returns to its natural rate.
13 The change rule, like the first-difference rule, does not specify the long-run value of the real
federal funds rate; it nonetheless achieves this value in the long run through its response to inflation
deviations from 2 percent and to unemployment rate deviations from its natural rate. By contrast, Taylor-
type rules include an intercept term that is assumed to correspond to the long-run value of the real federal
funds rate.

responsive to labor market tightness over the next few years than assumed in
the staff projection. This overshooting occurs because the tightening in the
stance of policy prescribed by these rules arrives too late to fully contain the
inflation pressures brought about by substantial unemployment rate
undershooting in combination with a steeper wage Phillips curve. By
contrast, the relatively aggressive response of monetary policy embedded in
the change rule is able to forestall the rise in inflation—provided this future
stance is fully anticipated by price and wage setters, as we assume in the
simulation.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic
implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board

n
o quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters. When the Tealbook is
M
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters. Rules that
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. To isolate the effects of
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate. The “Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012).
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.

of the U.S. economy.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and
the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close
the output gap at the end of this time frame, whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal
funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters have perfect foresight and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealbook
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large-scale asset
purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin
in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
price inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps
( , measure𝑃𝑃d𝑃𝑃 a𝑃𝑃s the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of

quarterly discount factor :

specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the

Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect
foresight and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy
decisions made prior to the simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a
horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon further would not
affect the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits.
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICS

From: David Wilcox
Subject: Corrected Probabilities of Returning to the Effective Lower Bound
In the Risk and Uncertainty section of the April Tealbook A, the box “A
Guidepost for Dropping Effective Lower Bound Risk from the Assessment of Risks” (on
pages 68-69) presented calculations of the probability that the federal funds rate would
return to the effective lower bound (ELB). The calculations were constructed using
stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model around the staff baseline projection and
were shown in figures 1 and 2 of the box.
During the process of preparing to show updated versions of these
probabilities in subsequent Tealbooks, a small error was found in the code that
constructed these calculations. This note provides corrected calculations of the
probabilities that had been shown in the box. The red lines in figures 1 and 2 show the
correct probabilities, and the black lines show what was in the April Tealbook. In a few
places in the text, the correct calculations are shown in red and the incorrect ones are
shown in black strikeout. Even with these corrections, the main point of the box is
unchanged: Given the baseline April forecast, the probability of returning to the ELB
will probably be low enough around the third quarter of this year that we will consider
dropping it as a factor that contributes importantly to our assessment of a downside skew
in the risks for our projection of economic activity.

A Guidepost for Dropping Effective Lower Bound Risk
from the Assessment of Risks
The staff has for some time judged that the risks to the projection for real activity are
skewed to the downside due to the effective lower bound (ELB) constraint on the federal
funds rate. All else being equal, a higher expected path for the federal funds rate lowers
the probability that policymakers will be constrained by the ELB in the near future, which
reduces downside macroeconomic risks. With the federal funds rate having risen to the
range of ¾ to 1 percent and expected to rise further going forward, we will face a
decision about when to drop the ELB reference from the Tealbook’s assessment of risks.
In this discussion, we describe how one specific measure of ELB risk has evolved since
liftoff and is expected to evolve in the future. We then lay out one possible way to use
this measure to inform our decision on when to drop our reference to the downside
economic risk stemming from the ELB.
Figure 1 shows a measure of ELB risk—the probability that the federal funds rate will be
at the ELB for at least one quarter during the next three years—computed from 20,000
stochastic simulations of FRB/US around the Tealbook baseline projection using the non-
inertial version of the Taylor rule.1 According to figure 1, the ELB risk measure was above
40 30 percent throughout most of 2016 but then moved below 40 30 percent early this
year. The ELB risk measure based on the April 2017 Tealbook projection is 28 26 percent.2
1 We use the non-inertial Taylor rule to capture the fact that policymakers typically cut interest rates
aggressively in the face of a looming recession, even though they often increase interest rates gradually
in the aftermath of a recession. In sticky-price models that account for the ELB, this asymmetric
behavior is consistent with the prescription of optimal commitment policy and other well-performing
rules, such as the price-level targeting rule and the rule proposed in David Reifschneider and John C.
Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and
Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936–66.
2 In the stochastic simulation, many of the ELB episodes are short lived, with the federal funds rate
touching the ELB in only one or two quarters. According to the April 2017 Tealbook projection, the
probability that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least four quarters (not necessarily
consecutive) during the next three years is about 10 percent.

Note that ELB risk fluctuated during 2016 even though the actual federal funds rate
remained constant in the range of ¼ to ½ percent. These movements reflect the fact
that the ELB risk measure depends not only on the current federal funds rate, but also on
the projected path of the federal funds rate. When the projected path of the federal
funds rate becomes flatter (steeper), ELB risk increases (decreases). For example, when
the staff reduced its estimate of the long-run equilibrium value of the federal funds
rate—the intercept in the Taylor rule—in the June 2016 Tealbook projection, the
projected path of the federal funds rate flattened appreciably. As a result, the ELB risk
increased, from about 37 31 percent in April 2016 to more than 52 34 percent in June 2016.
Figure 2 shows the projected path of the ELB risk according to the current Tealbook
forecast. In this figure, the ELB risk at any given date shows the model-implied
probability that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least one quarter during
the subsequent three years if the economy has evolved according to the current
Tealbook projection up to that time. Because the federal funds rate is expected to rise,
ELB risk is expected to decline further from its current level. It declines even below its
steady-state value of 18 percent—shown by the dashed line—reflecting the projected
overshooting of the federal funds rate above its long-run value of 3 percent.3 Indeed, as
a result of the forward-looking nature of the ELB risk measure, the ELB risk is expected to
decline below its steady-state value in late 2017 early 2018, when the federal funds rate is
still expected to be substantially below its long-run value of 3 percent.
We plan to consult this ELB risk measure to inform our decision about when to drop the
ELB reference in our assessment of risks in the Tealbook. Our provisional plan is to stop
highlighting the ELB risk sometime after our measure of ELB risk is below 25 percent. The
choice of 25 percent is somewhat arbitrary, and others may see a different threshold level
as more appropriate. As can be seen in figure 2, according to the April Tealbook
projection, the ELB risk measure is likely to dip below 25 percent for the first time in
2017:Q3, when the federal funds rate is projected to be a little above 1 percent. The date
when this measure moves below 25 percent will depend on the actual evolution of the
economy as well as the evolution of the staff projection. If the federal funds rate rises
more slowly or the staff projection of the funds rate path becomes flatter than
anticipated by the current Tealbook projection—possibly because the staff further
lowers its estimate of the long-run equilibrium natural rate—the threshold will be
breached later than 2017:Q3.
3 The steady-state value of the ELB risk is the model-implied probability that the federal funds rate
will be at the ELB for at least one quarter during the next three years, conditional on the economy being
at its steady state today. This concept is distinct from the unconditional probability that the federal
funds rate is at the ELB. To compute the steady-state ELB risk shown in figure 2, we begin stochastic
simulations from a steady state consistent with that shown in the Long-Term Outlook exhibit of the April
Tealbook projection.
