Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The economic outlook is broadly similar to the one we presented in the June D
n
Tealbook.1 Even with the disappointing June retail sales data, we continue to see the o
c
E
incoming information as supporting the view that the lackluster output growth in the first c
ti
quarter would give way to a more sizable increase in the second quarter.2 For the second e s
m
half of the year, we currently anticipate that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of about o
D
2½ percent—not quite as fast as we anticipated in June and down slightly from the
2¾ percent pace reflected in the tables and figures that accompany this text, but still
sufficient to further widen the gap between actual and potential output.3 Labor market
conditions have continued to tighten, with payroll employment running well above the
pace required to absorb new entrants into the workforce. The unemployment rate has
moved down ¼ percentage point so far this year, and we expect it to edge down further in
the second half.
Beyond this year, we still expect GDP growth to slow in 2018 and 2019 as
monetary policy tightens. Even so, GDP rises faster than its potential rate throughout the
medium term, and the output gap widens to nearly 2 percent by the end of 2019. The
unemployment rate is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by that time, about 1 percentage
point below our estimate of its natural rate. Revisions to the key conditioning factors
underpinning our forecast are offsetting in this projection. Although we maintained our
assumption that expansionary fiscal policy will be implemented early next year, we
reduced the size of the placeholder tax cut by half and shortened its duration. In the other
direction, the lower projected paths for the dollar and longer-term interest rates boost
GDP growth slightly in 2018 and 2019.
As for inflation, we have been surprised with the weakness in monthly readings
for March through May; in response, we have nudged down our projection over the near
1 Throughout this document, the text has been updated to take on board material information from
the CPI, retail sales, and Monthly Treasury Statement, which were published after the Tealbook projection
was finalized on July 13. Since the figures and tables present the July Tealbook projection, they do not
reflect the news from these releases.
2 The Monthly Treasury Statement pointed to considerably stronger defense spending in the
second quarter than we had anticipated; on net, after folding in the retail sales data, our GDP estimate for
the second quarter is little changed from the value shown in the figures and tables.
3 The BEA is scheduled to publish its initial estimate of second-quarter GDP along with its annual
revision to the NIPA on July 28, the Friday after the FOMC meeting.

l Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
e

e
D
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is above the projections from both the
n
o
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017
c
E
and below the Blue Chip consensus in 2018. The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is
c
s
ti
lower than the SPF forecast in 2017. The staff’s projection for CPI inflation is below
e
m those of outside forecasters in 2017 and is above them in 2018. The staff’s projections
o
D for both overall and core PCE price inflation are noticeably below the SPF forecasts in
2017 but only slightly below the SPF forecasts in 2018.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
o
D
Fiscal Policy
 Considerable uncertainty remains about the potential size, timing, and
composition of federal fiscal policy changes that may be enacted during the
forecast period. However, given that the Congress and the Administration
have not yet coalesced around a specific set of policy changes and that there
now appears to be more resistance to increasing the federal deficit than we
had previously expected, we have reduced the size of the fiscal expansion we
anticipate will take effect next year. As a placeholder, we continue to assume
that the expansion will take the form of a cut to personal taxes, but we now
assume that it will increase the annual primary budget deficit (that is, the
deficit excluding interest costs) by ½ percent of GDP rather than the 1 percent
assumption we adopted in the December 2016 Tealbook. Further, we now
assume that it will begin to be gradually phased out after 5 years, resulting in a
substantially smaller increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio after 10 years than we
had assumed in the June projection.
 The revised fiscal expansion is expected to boost the level of real GDP about
¼ percent by the end of 2019, half as much as in our previous projection; this
estimate is exclusive of multiplier effects and offsets from lower interest rates
and the dollar.
Monetary Policy
 The assumed path of the federal funds rate is lower than in the June Tealbook,
primarily reflecting a downward adjustment that we made to the long-run
value of r* and hence to the intercept in the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we
use to mechanically set this rate in our projection.

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 14, 2017
k
o
o
t l o We lowered the assumed long-run value of r* by 50 basis points from our
u
O
previous assumption of 1 percent. Half of this adjustment reflected our
&
e l revised fiscal assumption: Because we now have the placeholder fiscal
v
e
D expansion being phased out rather than persisting into the longer run, we
n
o reversed the fiscal-policy-related increment of 25 basis points to the long-
c
E
c run value of r* that we introduced in the December 2016 Tealbook. The
ti
s
e other half reflects a decision to reduce the staff assumption regarding r*
m
o after a reappraisal of model-based estimates of this parameter. A year ago,
D
when we last lowered r*, we assumed that the model-based estimates
would gradually rise as the economy continued to strengthen, but instead
the model-based estimates have been flat over the past year (see the box
“The Equilibrium Real Rate in the Longer Run” in the Monetary Policy
Strategies section).4
o With the changes to r*, the intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor rule
generates an average federal funds rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter
of this year and 3.3 percent at the end of 2019, about 10 basis points and
40 basis points, respectively, below their levels in the June Tealbook
projection.
o We allowed only a portion of the downward revision to interest rates
related to the reductions in r* to show through to stronger aggregate
demand. In particular, the portion associated with the change in the stance
of fiscal policy is assumed to support demand and so partially offset the
lower impetus from fiscal policy. However, we did not allow the
reduction in interest rates associated with the remainder of the reduction in
r* to boost our medium-term projection, because that portion of the r*
adjustment reflected a judgment that an easier stance of monetary policy
than we previously believed will be required to achieve full employment
and price stability in the longer run.
4 For additional information, a summary of the evidence on recent model-based estimates is
presented in the memo “Long-Run Value for the Equilibrium Rate of Interest,” by Cristina Fuentes-Albero,
June 25, 2017.

Other Interest Rates o
c
E
 The 10-year Treasury yield is revised markedly down in this projection, c
ti
s
reflecting the downward revision to the projected path of future short-term e
m
interest rates over the valuation window and, to a lesser extent, lower term o
D
premiums.5 Overall, the 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise over the
medium term, from an average of 2.5 percent in the current quarter to
3.4 percent by the end of 2019; the latter figure is about 60 basis points lower
than in the June projection.
 The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was revised in line with changes to
the path for the 10-year Treasury yield. However, we lowered our projection
for the triple-B corporate bond spread a bit in the near term in response to the
persistently lower-than-expected spread over the past few quarters.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices are broadly in line with our projection in the June Tealbook.
We continue to hold the view that valuation pressures will limit the scope for
further stock price appreciation over the medium term. Accordingly, equity
prices are projected to rise only about ½ percent per year in the medium term,
about the same as in the June Tealbook.
 Incoming data on house prices have been in line with our expectations, and we
have kept our forecast for house price appreciation this year at around
6 percent. Currently, we judge that the ratio of house prices to rents is
marginally above its long-run trend. To reflect this consideration, we project
the growth in home values to slow to around 4 percent in 2018 and 2019, a
pace that would stabilize the ratio of house prices to rents.
5 The downward revisions to term premiums reflect the staff’s assumption that the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet will be larger—both before and after the normalization of its size is achieved—
than we had assumed in the June Tealbook A forecast. In addition, the revision to the assumed fiscal
expansion pushed down term premiums by reducing projected government debt over the longer run.

t l Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
u
O
&  We estimate that foreign economic activity grew at a solid pace of around
l
e 3 percent in the first half of the year. In aggregate, the forecast for the second
v
e
D quarter is about the same as in the June Tealbook, as upward revisions in
n
o
c Canada, the euro area, Japan, and China have been offset by downward
E
c revisions in Mexico and Brazil. We continue to foresee growth abroad
ti
s
e moderating a little to its potential pace of around 2½ percent by early 2018
m
o
D and remaining there over the rest of the forecast period.
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 1½ percent since the time of
the June Tealbook, largely reflecting movements against the advanced foreign
economy currencies. However, we expect the broad real dollar to appreciate
at about a 1¾ percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market
expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast. This
rate of increase is a bit lower than in the June Tealbook, mostly because of the
decrease in the staff expectation for U.S. interest rates. Relative to the June
Tealbook, our projection for the broad real dollar at the end of 2019 is down
2½ percent.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil closed on Wednesday, July 12, at about
$48 per barrel, $3 per barrel lower than at the time of the June Tealbook. Oil
prices fell about $6 per barrel on news of recoveries in Libyan and Nigerian
production as well as the continued strength of U.S. oil production. Prices
subsequently bounced back on early indications that the recovery in U.S. oil
production may be slowing. Futures prices are roughly unchanged, as the
increases in Libyan and Nigerian production remain tenuous. In line with the
now slightly upward-sloping futures curve, we project that the price of
imported oil will edge up over the projection period.
 Prices for industrial metals have risen about 3 percent since the time of the
June Tealbook as a result of stronger demand from China and a renewed
threat of short-term supply disruptions in the production of copper in both
Chile and Indonesia. Agricultural prices have also risen 3 percent since the
June Tealbook, mainly reflecting a weaker supply outlook for several crops in
the United States.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP t l
u
O
&
After posting a modest reading in the first quarter, real GDP growth looks to have
l
e
v
picked up in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2½ percent, similar to our June e
D
Tealbook forecast.6 The data received after we closed the July Tealbook projection n
o
c
implied offsetting revisions to second-quarter GDP growth: The June retail sales data fell E
c
well short of our expectations, but the Monthly Treasury Statement for June implied s
ti
e
m
stronger defense purchases. However, taking into account the latest data, we now project
o
D
GDP will increase at a 2½ percent rate over the remainder of the year, somewhat less
than in the June Tealbook forecast.
 Incoming data indicate that real PCE growth in the first quarter was not as
weak as we had previously estimated, and a rebound in the pace of spending
in the second quarter still appears to have occurred—though to a somewhat
lesser extent than we expected. All told, we continue to put the rate of PCE
growth over the first half of the year at around 2 percent. Despite the
disappointing June reading on retail sales, we still expect PCE to rise at a solid
pace in the second half of the year, supported by ongoing gains in income and
wealth as well as upbeat readings on consumer sentiment. A large part of the
second-half pickup in PCE growth reflects our expectation that motor vehicle
sales will level off after stepping down noticeably in the first half of the year.
 In the residential sector, single-family and multifamily housing starts moved
down, on net, over April and May, and permit issuance in both categories
softened some as well. In addition, revised data suggest a larger decline in the
average value of homes started this past winter, which will likely be a drag on
real residential investment over the second and third quarters of this year as
the construction of those homes is completed. In all, the incoming data
suggest a weaker near-term trajectory for residential investment than we had
written down in the June Tealbook. Even so, the recent pattern remains
consistent with the softening in residential investment that our models
expected in response to the rise in mortgage rates since autumn.
6 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2017:Q2 Real GDP Growth,” the
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at
2.5 percent, is in line with the staff’s judgmental projection.

 Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have risen at an annual t l
u
O
rate of around 5 percent in the second quarter, and with readings on business
&
sentiment having remained favorable, we project broadly similar gains in the e l
v
e
second half of the year. Such a pace is lackluster in comparison with the D
n
average increase in previous expansions, but it is still a noticeable o
c
E
improvement from the outright decline in 2016. Elsewhere, investment in c
ti
s
nonresidential structures has been on a sharp upward trajectory since the e
m
beginning of the year, with a rebound in investment in drilling and mining o
D
structures accounting for the strength. Given the relatively flat projected path
for crude oil prices, however, we expect the boost to nonresidential
construction from the energy sector to taper off. In all, the outlook for
business investment in 2017 is little revised from the June Tealbook.
 Government purchases were weak, on balance, in the first half of this year,
particularly for state and local construction. We continue to forecast a
rebound in government purchases in the second half.
 We estimate that real export and import growth stepped down to rates of
1 percent and 1½ percent, respectively, in the second quarter, and we project
that growth in both will move back up to around 3 percent this quarter. We
estimate that net exports will subtract around 0.1 percentage point from U.S.
GDP growth in both the second and third quarters. In each quarter, these
contributions are ¼ percentage point less negative than in the June Tealbook,
because import data have come in lower than expected and the dollar has
depreciated.
 We now estimate that manufacturing output increased at a moderate annual
rate of about 2 percent in the first half of this year, a little below our June
Tealbook projection. The modest gains projected for factory output in the
coming months reflect both the positive signal from recent readings on new
orders in the regional and national manufacturing surveys and the negative
signal from the automakers’ latest production schedules. Those schedules call
for a sizable decline in motor vehicle assemblies this quarter, likely reflecting
the elevated days’ supply of new vehicles.

t l For the medium term, we project real GDP will increase 2¼ percent in 2018 and a
u
O
bit under 2 percent in 2019. This forecast for gradually slower growth is little revised
&
e l from the June Tealbook and reflects the ongoing normalization of monetary policy.
v
e
D
n
o  This round, revisions to the key conditioning factors underpinning our
c
E
forecast are offsetting in the medium term. While the scaled-back fiscal
c
ti
s expansion provides less of a boost to demand over the medium term, the lower
e
m
o paths for the dollar and for longer-term interest rates work in the other
D
direction.
 In 2018 and 2019, we project real PCE growth will average a moderate pace
of 2½ percent, and we expect the saving rate to be fairly flat, a pattern in
rough accordance with our baseline consumption models. The box
“Population Aging and the Saving Rate” considers the extent to which aging
may place upward pressure on consumption relative to income in
coming years.
 We continue to assume that potential GDP growth will edge up to 1¾ percent
by the end of the medium term. Real GDP growth outpaces potential growth
throughout the projection, and resource utilization tightens further. At the end
of 2019, real GDP is projected to exceed its potential level by 2 percent,
unchanged from the June Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
The June employment report indicated that labor market conditions have
continued to improve in recent months. Payroll gains were a little stronger than
anticipated, while data from the household survey were close to our expectation.
 Private payroll gains were larger than expected in June, and the estimates for
April and May were revised up.7 Government employment also rose by more
than expected in June, but we took little signal, as government payrolls have
been volatile in recent months. Over the first half of the year, the average
7 The relatively early survey week in May and the late survey week in June may have contributed
to some shifting in reported payroll gains between those two months, as some summer hiring (particularly
of young workers) not fully reflected in the May report would have been included in June.

o
monthly increase in private payrolls was 170,000, about 10,000 higher than in t l
u
O
the June Tealbook and similar to the average gain in 2016.8
&
l
e
v
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate was just a touch higher than e
D
expected in June, rounding up to 4.4 percent and bringing the second-quarter n
o
c
average to 4.4 percent, ½ percentage point below the level a year earlier. The E
c
labor force participation rate ticked up to 62.8 percent in June, and the s
ti
e
m
employment-to-population ratio edged up to 60.1 percent; both moves were in
o
D
line with our expectations.
 We have made only minor adjustments to our near-term labor market forecast.
In the second half of the year, we expect the gains in total payroll employment
to average about 175,000 per month. We continue to project that the
unemployment rate will edge down to 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, and
that the participation rate will tick down to 62.7 percent.
We made no changes to our supply-side assumptions.
 Although the downside surprises in the recent inflation readings have led us to
consider revising down our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, for
now we have decided to maintain our assumption that the natural rate is
4.9 percent.
 We will reassess our estimates of potential GDP and the natural rate of
unemployment after we receive the annual revision to the NIPA (which will
also include new estimates of compensation per hour) as well as additional
readings on the ECI and inflation.
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed, the outlook for the
labor market is similar to our June Tealbook projection.
 After having decreased about 1¼ percentage points since early 2015, the
unemployment rate is projected to decline another ½ percentage point over the
8 Government employment has increased a little more slowly thus far in 2017 than it did in 2016.
All told, the projected average monthly increase in total nonfarm payrolls in the first half of 2017 of
180,000 is lower than the average increase in 2016 of 187,000.

Population Aging and the Saving Rate
&
l
e
v The aggregate personal saving rate, shown by the black line in the left panel of figure 1,
e
D
declined substantially in the decades leading up to the Great Recession, falling to 2½ percent
n
o in 2005, and then moved up sharply during the recession and has stabilized around
c
E 5½ percent. This discussion explores whether shifts in the age distribution of the population
c
ti can account for some of these movements in the saving rate and the extent to which
s
e population aging may affect the saving rate going forward. The main result is that changes in
m
the age distribution cannot explain the broad movements in the saving rate over the past few
o
D decades. However, now that retirees are a large and growing share of the population, their
dissaving may begin to put more material downward pressure on the saving rate in
coming years.
Using household-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure
Survey, we derive a life-cycle saving rate as a function of age.1 Each point on the curve in the
right panel of figure 1 shows the saving rate at a particular age relative to that of a 25-year-
old. In a given year, a typical household headed by a 40-year-old has a saving rate that is
roughly 10 percentage points higher than the saving rate of the typical household of a
25-year-old. It is not surprising that young earners, who can often anticipate higher future
income, have a lower saving rate than workers later in their career, who are frequently saving
for house purchases, children’s college tuition, and retirement. After age 55, the saving rate
begins to drop rapidly and turns negative as the heads of households move into retirement
and begin to tap into their wealth to support their consumption. This hump-shaped life-cycle
path of the saving rate is consistent with prior theoretical and empirical work.2
1 Each year, roughly 6,000 households participating in the Consumer Expenditure Survey provide
detailed information about their consumption and income, which we use to construct mean saving rates by
the age of the head of household. We then fit these saving rates to a third-degree polynomial in age. The
estimation uses data from 1986 to 2014 and includes year fixed effects—that is, the level of the saving rate is
allowed to vary by year even though the relative life-cycle profile is fixed.
2 For example, see Karen E. Dynan, Wendy Edelberg, and Michael G. Palumbo (2009), “The Effects of
Population Aging on the Relationship among Aggregate Consumption, Saving, and Income,” American
Economic Review, vol. 99 (May), pp. 380–86; and Pierre-Oliver Gourinchas and Jonathan A. Parker (2002),
“Consumption over the Life Cycle,” Econometrica, vol. 70 (January), pp. 47–89.

The left panel of figure 2 summarizes information on the changing age distribution of the O
population. Household heads between the ages of 35 and 55 are categorized as “savers” and &
everyone else (which includes those under 35 and over 55) as “spenders.” The percentage of e l
v
savers—the blue area—peaked around 2000 when the baby boomers hit their highest saving e
D
years. Since 2000, the percentage of spenders has gradually increased as baby boomers
n
moved into their retirement years, as can be seen by the notable expansion of the o
c
percentage of the population over the age of 55—the green area. E
c
ti
s
The effect of population aging on the aggregate saving rate can be derived by combining the e
m
estimated life-cycle path of the saving rate with population data. As shown in the right panel o
D
of figure 2, changes in the age distribution put increasing downward pressure on the saving
rate through the 1970s as young baby boomers had low savings rates. After 1980, that
downward pressure diminished as the baby boomers moved into their saving years, and
aging’s upward effect on the saving rate peaked in 2000. Since then, the age distribution has
increasingly weighed on the aggregate saving rate as more baby boomers have moved into
the dissaving phase of retirement.
In figure 1, the red line in the left panel puts the magnitude of this population-aging effect
into perspective by showing how it would affect the published and forecast saving rate. This
“age adjusted” saving rate subtracts the effect shown in figure 2 from the official rate—that
is, it shows what the saving rate would have been if the population age distribution had not
changed since 1965. Changes in the age distribution appear to account for very little of the
movement in the saving rate over the past half-century. 3 However, as the population
distribution continues to shift toward retirees, the downward pressure on the saving rate
(and boost to consumer spending) will become more pronounced. Aging’s effect on the
saving rate, all else being equal, may also partially mitigate the downward pressure on the
natural rate of interest from other age-related channels such as slower labor force growth
along with the associated higher capital-to-labor ratio.4
3 The explanation for these movements must lie in other factors. For example, rising wealth and
transfer income and expanding access to credit could explain the secular decline in the saving rate, while
increased pessimism could explain the step-up in the saving rate since the Great Recession.
4 For a full accounting of the effects of aging on the natural rate of interest, see Etienne Gagnon,
Benjamin K. Johannsen, and David Lopez-Salido (2016), “Understanding the New Normal: The Role of
Demographics,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-080 (Washington: Board of Governors of the

ti  The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend next year

D individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows. On net, the
participation rate is projected to be ¼ percentage point above our estimate of
its trend level at the end of 2019, unchanged from the June Tealbook.
 We project that productivity will increase slightly less than 1 percent per year,
on average, over the forecast period, a bit slower than in 2016—though still
up from its average over the preceding several years—and slightly below our
estimate of its structural pace.9
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Twelve-month changes in core PCE prices have slowed from 1¾ percent earlier
this year to about 1½ percent at present, and we expect they will remain in that
neighborhood through late this year.
 The May readings of both headline and core PCE price inflation were lower
than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook—a third month of downside
surprises—and estimates for previous months were revised down a touch. We
continue to view these surprises as partly driven by idiosyncratic movements
in a few specific categories. Nevertheless, we nudged down our near-term
projection to take on board the weakness in some categories—such as housing
services and other market-based services—that has been more persistent than
anticipated. The June CPI and PPI releases were in line with these slightly
downgraded expectations. We expect that the upcoming monthly readings on
core inflation will remain modest through the remainder of this year, partly
9 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly because a larger share of workers hired in a tight labor market have below-average
productivity than is the case during a slack labor market.

 We estimate that PCE energy prices dropped in the second quarter following e
D
sizable increases in the previous two quarters. With oil prices having declined n

c
some since the June Tealbook, we now expect PCE energy prices to move E
c
down, on net, over the second half of the year. s
ti
e
m
o
 After declining in 2016, PCE food prices barely edged up in the first quarter D
but look to have increased at an annual rate of around 2 percent in the second
quarter. With food commodity prices having recovered somewhat since the
beginning of the year, we expect food price inflation to run slightly ahead of
core inflation over the second half of the year.
 Based on data through May, core import price inflation is estimated to have
stepped up from a meager annual rate of ¼ percent in the first quarter to a
2 percent pace in the second quarter. We expect it to rise to 3½ percent in the
third quarter, boosted by recent dollar depreciation. Import price inflation is
expected to slow to a ¾ percent pace by 2018, consistent with moderate
foreign inflation and a gradually appreciating dollar.
The latest readings on longer-term inflation expectations accord with our view
that these expectations remain reasonably stable.
 In the preliminary July report from the University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers, median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years ticked
up to 2.6 percent, still relatively low by the standards of this series.
 The June reading on the median three-year-ahead expected inflation from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations
moved back up to 2¾ percent, in line with the range of values observed earlier
this year.
 The median projection for 10-year average PCE price inflation from the
Survey of Professional Forecasters (a reading taken in May) held steady at
2.1 percent in the second quarter.

We have received only a little information on hourly compensation since the June
Tealbook. In the medium term, we continue to forecast that the healthy labor market will
bring about a further step-up in the growth of hourly compensation, to a pace of
3½ percent.
 Average hourly earnings (AHE) of all employees were again a little below our
expectations in June. AHE increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending
in June, about even with the gain a year earlier but below the 2¾ percent rate
of increase seen in late 2016.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3.4 percent
in May, below its recent highs but still well above the pace observed a few
years ago.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be
4.9 percent in the longer run, and that the growth rate of potential GDP will be
1¾ percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by late 2021.
 Real GDP growth slows to about 1½ percent in 2020 and 1¼ percent in 2021
as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level. The unemployment rate is
4.1 percent in 2021 and continues to rise gradually toward its assumed natural
rate in subsequent years.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Incoming data continue to point to widespread strong performance abroad,
especially in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). We estimate that foreign
economic output rose at a solid 2¾ percent annual rate in the second quarter after a robust
3¼ percent gain the quarter before. In aggregate, the forecast for the second quarter is
unchanged from the June Tealbook, as stronger-than-anticipated indicators have led to
upward revisions in most AFEs and China, which have been offset by downward
revisions in Mexico and Brazil.
k
o
o
We continue to see foreign GDP growth stabilizing at its potential pace of around l
t
u
O
2½ percent by early 2018. While economic activity decelerates in Canada to a more
&
sustainable pace and Chinese growth slows in line with potential, growth picks up in e l
v
e
Latin America as Brazil pulls out of its recession and Mexico shakes off its recent D
n
weakness. With the expansion abroad now more firmly established, downside risks to o
c
E
the global economy have diminished since last year. That said, important concerns
l
’
t
n
remain, notably that a hard landing in China could trigger a sharp slowdown in other I
emerging market economies (EMEs), an outcome that we explore in the “China-Driven
EME Turbulence” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Against the backdrop of stronger economic activity in most AFEs, the Bank of
Canada (BOC) hiked its policy rate on July 12 and the Bank of England (BOE) and
European Central Bank (ECB) alluded to the possibility of reducing the pace of monetary
stimulus (see the box “Recent Actions and Communications by Foreign Central Banks”).
Markets have taken considerable signal from these discussions, with sovereign yields of
these economies jumping and their currencies appreciating, developments that are
discussed in more detail in the Financial Market Developments section. The BOC rate
hike occurred two quarters earlier than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook. We also
pulled forward the tightening of policy rates by the BOE by two quarters and the ECB by
one quarter, and we have end-2019 rates in both cases a bit higher than we anticipated in
June. However, given remaining slack and expectations of continued low underlying
inflation, we still see monetary policy in all three economies staying quite
accommodative for some time. That said, there is some chance of even faster growth and
greater tightening of monetary policies abroad than we expect, an upside risk that we

Recent Actions and Communications by Foreign Central Banks
Over the past six weeks or so, actions and communications by officials from several advanced
foreign economy central banks have jolted global financial markets, boosting bond yields
abroad and in the United States (see figure). In this discussion, we summarize monetary policy
developments in the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Canada (BOC), and Bank of England
(BOE) and examine the implications for our economic and monetary policy outlook.
European Central Bank
Since the publication of the June Tealbook, the ECB took two incremental steps toward
eventually beginning to normalize its monetary policy stance. First, at its June 8 meeting, the
Governing Council changed its forward guidance. The ECB now expects to maintain its policy
k
o rate at its current level for an extended period, whereas it had previously expected to maintain
o
l
t its policy rate at current or lower levels. Second, in a speech on June 27, ECB President Draghi
u
O
noted that the forces weighing on euro-area inflation should prove “temporary” and that, as
&
the economy continues to recover, monetary policy should adjust—albeit gradually and only as
l
e
v underlying inflation dynamics improve.1 As can be seen in the figure, President Draghi’s speech
e
D appeared to elicit a significant response in long-term yields, both in the euro area and
n
o elsewhere.
c
E
l
’
t Although President Draghi’s speech caught markets by surprise, the recent ECB
n
I
communications do not change our view that the withdrawal of stimulus will be both long in
coming and quite gradual after it does arrive. We view those communications as both a
necessary acknowledgment that economic prospects have improved and a way of preparing
markets for the eventual normalization. With slack remaining and inflation still subdued, we
continue to expect the ECB to normalize its policy stance only slowly, waiting until early 2018 to
begin tapering asset purchases and until mid-2018 to cease them. But in light of the recent
communications and positive incoming data, we have the ECB beginning to raise its policy rate
in late 2018, one quarter earlier than in the June Tealbook, and reaching ¼ percent by late 2019,
¼ percentage point higher than in June.
Bank of Canada
The BOC raised its policy rate ¼ percentage point to ¾ percent on July 12, two quarters earlier
than assumed in the June Tealbook. The policy change followed statements by BOC officials,
including Governor Poloz, displaying a more hawkish tone and suggesting a substantial change
in the BOC’s assessment of the economic outlook. The BOC cited the broadening of the
economic recovery, attributed recent weak inflation readings to past economic slack, and
expressed more confidence that diminishing resource slack would push up inflation. In
contrast, as recently as April, the BOC was expressing concern about the concentration of
growth in a narrow set of industries and pointing to subdued price and wage inflation as
evidence of material excess capacity.
1 See Mario Draghi (2017), “Accompanying the Economic Recovery,” speech delivered at the ECB Forum on
Central Banking, Sintra, June 27, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2017/html/ecb.sp170627.en.html.

We view the BOC’s shift to a less accommodative stance, in part, as reflecting greater
confidence in the recovery. The BOC also emphasized that the recent soft inflation readings
partly reflect idiosyncratic factors and should be temporary. Accordingly, we expect monetary
policy to be slightly less accommodative over the nearer term and anticipate that the BOC will
raise its policy rate again in the first quarter of 2018. Nevertheless, our new assumptions for
Canadian monetary policy entail only an adjustment in the timing of policy rate actions over the
forecast horizon, and, with our longer-term outlook for the Canadian economy little changed,
our forecast for the policy rate at the end of 2019 remains at 2 percent.
Bank of England
On June 14, the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) surprised markets with an k
o
unexpectedly close vote to keep the policy rate at ¼ percent. Three dissenting MPC members o
l
t
preferred a rate hike, expressing concern that, amid limited resource slack, the recent u
O
overshoot of inflation above target could be more persistent than previously thought.
&
Subsequently, Governor Carney stated that “some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to l
e
become necessary” if spare capacity erodes further.2 e v
D
n
Overall, these developments are responses to persistently elevated inflation (reflecting the o
c
E
post-Brexit depreciation of the sterling) and a record-low unemployment rate. Given the
l
’
t
uncertain growth outlook, we still see the BOE as maintaining its current policy stance through n
I
this year and tightening that stance only very gradually thereafter. But, consistent with our
higher inflation projection and the more hawkish BOE tone, we now expect the BOE to hike its
policy rate in the second quarter of 2018, two quarters earlier than previously assumed, and to
raise it to ¾ percent by the end of 2019, ¼ percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook.

explore in the alternative scenario “Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy” in the
Risks and Uncertainty section.
The heightened focus on policy normalization abroad seems to indicate that those
central banks are looking through recent declines in headline inflation as reflecting
transitory factors. Indeed, even though AFE headline inflation fell to ½ percent in the
second quarter at an annual rate, ½ percentage point lower than in the June Tealbook, this
decline largely reflected lower retail energy prices. Core inflation has held up better but
remains below central bank targets, except in the United Kingdom. As the transitory
effects wane and output gaps narrow, we see AFE inflation stepping up to 1¾ percent
k
o by 2019, just below authorities’ 2 percent inflation targets.
o
l
t
u
O
We estimate that EME inflation remained at 3¼ percent in the second quarter, a
&
e l touch lower than the June Tealbook projection, as surprisingly strong food price inflation
v
e
D in Mexico was offset by benign inflation in China and elsewhere. The Bank of Mexico
n
o (BOM) raised rates in June, as expected, continuing its sequence of successive rate hikes
c
E
l since late 2015, but it has also signaled an end to its tightening. Brazil’s inflation fell in
’
t
n
I June to its lowest level in a decade, and the Brazilian government lowered its inflation
target to 4 percent in 2020 from 4½ percent. We see aggregate EME inflation easing
to roughly 3 percent in this quarter and staying there for the remainder of the forecast
period.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Euro Area. Recent indicators—including elevated PMIs, solid retail sales, and brisk
industrial production—suggest that real GDP growth rose to almost 2¾ percent in the
second quarter from an upwardly revised 2.3 percent the quarter before, the fastest
pace seen in two years. Growth is projected to moderate to 1¾ percent by mid-2018
and edge down a touch more in 2019 as economic slack erodes. Compared with the
June Tealbook, this projection is about ¼ percentage point higher over the next year,
reflecting stronger-than-expected momentum in the economy.
Headline inflation tumbled from a rate of 2.9 percent in the first quarter to negative
0.1 percent in the second as a result of falling energy and food prices. Smoothing
through Easter-related volatility, core inflation appears to have risen from just under
1 percent in the second half of 2016 to roughly 1¼ percent in the first half of 2017,
slightly higher than we anticipated in June. Going forward, headline inflation is
Page 38 of 128

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 14, 2017
projected to bounce back from its second-quarter dip and then rise slowly thereafter,
reaching 1¾ percent only in late 2019, as the output gap narrows and wage growth
gradually picks up. Compared with the June Tealbook, this projection is a touch
higher in 2018 and 2019, reflecting slightly faster growth.
In light of the positive data and recent ECB communications, we now see the path of
monetary policy as slightly less accommodative. While we continue to expect the
ECB to begin tapering its asset purchases in early 2018 and to cease them by mid-
2018, we brought forward the liftoff of the deposit rate one quarter to the fourth
quarter of 2018 and see the policy rate being ¼ percent by end-2019 rather than zero.
k
o
o
• Canada. Following unusually strong GDP growth of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, l
t
u
recent data, such as monthly GDP for April and the manufacturing PMI through June, O
&
suggest that growth moderated to 2¾ percent in the second quarter. We expect l
e
v
growth to average around 2 percent through the remainder of this year and to settle at e
D
n
its potential pace of 1¾ percent thereafter. Relative to the June Tealbook, this
o
c
E
projection is stronger for the second quarter of 2017 on better-than-expected data but
l
’
t
a touch weaker in 2018 and 2019 because of an appreciated Canadian dollar and n
I
higher interest rates.
We estimate that inflation slowed more sharply than expected, from 2.6 percent in the
first quarter to 1 percent in the second, reflecting surprisingly large declines in retail
energy prices. Downplaying these soft inflation readings as largely reflecting
temporary factors, and citing the broadening of economic growth, the BOC increased
its policy rate ¼ percentage point to ¾ percent on July 12, two quarters earlier than
we had anticipated in June. We assume that the BOC will next increase its policy rate
in the first quarter of 2018 but still see the policy rate at 2 percent by the end of 2019,
as in the June Tealbook, consistent with a nearly unchanged longer-term outlook.
• United Kingdom. Incoming data on industrial production, services output, and PMIs
were weaker than expected, suggesting that GDP growth only edged up to 1¼ percent
in the second quarter, ½ percentage point lower than in the June Tealbook. Going
forward, growth should settle at 1¾ percent, as we expect the drag on spending
exerted by uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations to be offset by continued
accommodative monetary policy and the weak sterling.

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 14, 2017
We estimate that headline inflation declined from 3.8 percent in the first quarter to
3¼ percent in the second, reflecting lower energy prices that partly offset the boost
from past currency depreciation. As the effects of past depreciation wane, inflation is
expected to gradually edge down toward the BOE’s 2 percent target. This projection
is a bit higher than in the June Tealbook, in part reflecting higher-than-anticipated
readings on core inflation.
We continue to anticipate that the BOE will keep its policy rate on hold this year and
remain quite accommodative thereafter, given the slowdown in economic activity,
sluggish wage growth, and uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations. But,
k
o in line with recent communications by the BOE and our higher inflation forecast, we
o
l
t moved up the timing of the first policy rate hike to the second quarter of 2018, two
u
O
quarters earlier than assumed in the June Tealbook, followed by a second hike
&
l
e in 2019. We now have the policy rate at the end of 2019 at ¾ percent, ¼ percentage
v
e
D point higher than we assumed in June.
n
o
c
E • Japan. Recent indicators, such as the manufacturing PMI through June and the July
l
’
t
n reading of the Tankan survey, continue to show solid momentum in the economy and
I
suggest that real GDP growth picked up to 2 percent in the second quarter. We
expect GDP growth to decline to a more sustainable pace, gradually edging down to
¾ percent by the end of 2018, before stalling in 2019 as a result of a planned
consumption tax hike. Relative to the June Tealbook, this projection is a touch higher
through mid-2018 owing to a weaker yen.
Inflation in Japan has remained moribund despite a very tight labor market, and, in
contrast to the other AFEs, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has refrained from discussing
any monetary policy normalization plan. In addition, although the BOJ has been
purchasing assets at a slower pace than in previous years, it has continued to pursue
its “yield curve control” policy of keeping its deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent and
targeting a rate around 0 percent for the yield on the 10-year Japanese government
bond. Accordingly, we still assume that the BOJ’s policy stance will remain highly
accommodative throughout the forecast period. Against this background, inflation is
projected to rise from an estimated rate of 0 percent in the second quarter to almost
1¼ percent in 2019 (excluding the effect of the consumption tax hike), still well
below the BOJ’s 2 percent target.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• Mexico. We estimate that Mexican real GDP growth dropped from 2.7 percent in the
first quarter to a disappointing 1½ percent pace in the second, ½ percentage point
below our June Tealbook forecast. Mexico has undertaken a program of budget
cutting in order to stabilize public debt and boost investor confidence, and this fiscal
consolidation has proven to be more of a drag on activity this year than we had
previously thought. Exports and household demand, which had both contributed to
surprisingly strong growth in recent quarters, have also softened of late, and both
residential and public investment have continued to decline amid tightening fiscal and
k
monetary policies. We expect economic growth to gradually move up to 2¾ percent o
o
l
by the end of the forecast period as this fiscal drag diminishes and as the effects of t
u
O
past exchange rate depreciation and energy-sector reforms kick in. &
l
e
v
Headline inflation eased in the second quarter to a still-high 7 percent from nearly e
D
n
10 percent in the first. Inflation is still being affected by last January’s fuel price o
c
E
hikes as well as by jumps in food prices. Core inflation has remained well above the
l
’
t
3 percent inflation target, partly reflecting pass-through of past peso depreciation. n
I
To keep inflationary pressures at bay, the BOM continued to tighten policy in late
June, raising its policy rate ¼ percentage point to 7 percent, 4 percentage points
above its level at the start of its tightening phase in late 2015. BOM policy
communications have led us to remove our assumption of further rate hikes, and we
actually now see some monetary policy easing in early 2018. We continue to see
inflation moving back down to near the 3 percent inflation target by mid-2018.
• Brazil. We now estimate that Brazil’s economy—after surging at a pace of
4¼ percent in the first quarter—contracted slightly in the second, a step-down that
was somewhat greater than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook. The
deceleration primarily reflects much weaker agricultural exports, which were boosted
in the first quarter by a record harvest. However, the most recent readings on
economic activity have been upbeat, and we see growth returning to positive territory.
But domestic demand remains very weak, restrained by tight monetary and fiscal
policies as well as by an ongoing political crisis that has damaged prospects for
much-needed reforms and has shaken business confidence. We therefore expect the
recovery to be tepid, with growth rising to only 2¼ percent by 2019.
Page 41 of 128

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 14, 2017
Inflation fell to 3 percent in June on a 12-month basis, its lowest level in 10 years,
reflecting both the steep recession and falling food prices; core inflation fell to
4 percent. With inflation well below the central bank’s target of 4½ percent and
domestic demand still weak, we see the Brazilian central bank cutting the policy rate
from its current level of 10.25 percent to 8.5 percent by the end of this year.
Signaling its determination to keep inflation low, the Brazilian government recently
lowered the inflation target to 4¼ percent for 2019 and 4 percent for 2020 and
suggested that the target would eventually be reduced to 3 percent.
• China. Available indicators suggest that China’s real GDP growth slowed to a still-
k
o solid 6¾ percent pace in the second quarter from 7.3 percent in the first. The gradual
o
l
t reining in of credit growth by Chinese monetary authorities since the beginning of the
u
O
& year has restrained economic activity; in particular, infrastructure and property-
l
e related investment growth have dipped. Even so, industrial production and exports
v
e
D have held up better than we expected, leading us to revise up growth ¼ percentage
n
o
point in the second quarter. We see growth slowing further to 6¼ percent in the
c
E
’ l second half of the year as the authorities continue to gradually tighten credit growth.
t
n
I Growth moderates further to 5¾ percent by 2019, in line with declines in potential
growth. We see some risk that credit tightening could trigger an escalation of
financial stress as vulnerabilities that have been building in the financial system are
exposed, leading to a sharp decline in output and spillovers to other EMEs.
Headline consumer price inflation bounced back to around 2¼ percent in the second
quarter after a food-price-induced dip in the first quarter. We expect inflation to
remain stable at about the current pace, although rising core inflation in recent months
suggests some upside risk to our forecast.
• Other Emerging Asia. While economic activity in the region remains relatively
buoyant, GDP growth likely moderated to 4 percent in the second quarter from
4.4 percent in the first. Export growth slowed across the region following its
supercharged pace in the previous few quarters, as the surge in demand for high-tech
goods and imports from China moderated. Industrial production has decelerated
along with exports in several economies, but manufacturing PMIs remain fairly
strong. We expect GDP growth to moderate further to a trend-like 3½ percent pace
by early next year, with slower growth in the region’s more export-oriented
economies offsetting somewhat stronger growth in India.

Financial Market Developments
Longer-dated nominal Treasury yields rose moderately over the intermeeting
period, apparently driven in large part by market perceptions of a shift toward a
somewhat less accommodative stance of monetary policy by some AFE central banks.1
Consistent with this view, the dollar depreciated against most AFE currencies. In
contrast, FOMC communications were reportedly viewed by market participants as
largely in line with previous communications. Market-implied probabilities of an
additional increase in the target range for the federal funds rate by the end of the year
were unchanged, on balance, even as the May CPI release came in weaker than market
participants had expected. On net, domestic risky asset prices were also little changed
amid continued low volatility.
 The market-implied probability of an increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate by the end of the year was unchanged, on net, at just under
50 percent.
 Ten-year nominal Treasury yields increased about 15 basis points, on balance,
over the intermeeting period, with large gains occurring on, and in the few
days after, remarks by ECB President Draghi and policymakers of other AFE
central banks that were interpreted as less accommodative than expected. s

1 On the morning after the Tealbook closed, data for the June CPI and June retail sales were
published. Both of these releases were viewed as weaker than expected, and, as of 10 a.m., they prompted
a decline in the market-implied probability of an additional increase in the target range for the federal funds
rate this year from just under 50 percent to just over 40 percent. Additionally, 5- and 10-year nominal
Treasury yields each declined about 4 basis points. The broad dollar index also fell about ⅓ percent, and
AFE sovereign yields fell slightly. These changes are not reflected in the remainder of this section.
However, they would not materially affect the broad characterization of financial market developments
over the intermeeting period.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were reportedly viewed, on
balance, as not materially altering market participants’ expectations for the path of the
federal funds rate. Some market participants were reportedly surprised by the degree to
which the Chair’s remarks during the press conference attributed the recent soft inflation
data to transitory factors. However, market participants also took note of the discussion
in the June FOMC minutes that while “most FOMC participants” perceived the recent
softness in price data as “largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors,” “several” expressed
concern that “progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective
might have slowed.” A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts suggests
that the probability that market participants attach to the next increase of the target range
for the federal funds rate occurring by the end of the year remains just under 50 percent,
despite having fallen for a time following the publication of the May CPI release.2 While
the market-implied probability of the next rate hike occurring at the July meeting
remained near zero, some probability mass shifted from the September meeting to the
December meeting. Meanwhile, the expected path of the federal funds rate from the end s

meeting as the most likely timing for such an announcement, with several additional
primary dealers having moved forward their modal call for the timing of the
announcement from the December meeting to the September meeting.
While short-dated nominal Treasury yields were little changed over the
intermeeting period, 5- and 10-year yields increased about 10 basis points and 15 basis
2 To the extent that a negative term premium is embedded in short-term rates, the market-implied
probability of an increase in the federal funds rate at upcoming meetings suggested by a straight read of
federal funds futures quotes may understate the true probability.

points, respectively. Nominal Treasury yields across maturities fell following the May
inflation release, and those declines were only partially retraced after the communications
from the June FOMC meeting that occurred later that day. Subsequently, however,
intermediate- and longer-dated nominal Treasury yields increased substantially, likely
reflecting in part a boost to term premiums from the less-accommodative-than-expected
remarks from ECB President Draghi on June 27 and later comments by other AFE central
bank officials that also signaled a less accommodative stance. (For more details, see the
box “Recent Actions and Communications by Foreign Central Banks” in the International
Economic Developments and Outlook section.) Treasury yields changed little, on net,
over the two days of the Chair’s testimony to the Congress.
The net increase in longer-term nominal yields over the intermeeting period
came mostly through higher real yields rather than inflation compensation, which also
moved up some for the period.
Despite their intermeeting period gains, longer-term real and nominal Treasury
yields remain very low by historical standards. The FOMC memo “Recent Movements
in Longer-Term Treasury Yields: Causes and Potential Policy Implications,” by Board
staff from the Divisions of Monetary Affairs, Research and Statistics, and International
Finance and by staff from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dated July 14,
provides an analysis of factors weighing on Treasury yields since December 2015.

Bank equity prices increased about 4 percent over the intermeeting period, buoyed

Explaining the Recent Outperformance of Financial Equities
Since the U.S. election last November, equity prices of domestic financial firms
have significantly outperformed the broader market. For example, over this
period, indexes of stock prices of large U.S. dealer banks and of alternative asset
managers increased 33 percent, while the S&P 500 index rose less than half that
amount (figure 1). To explain this differential performance, market participants
have pointed to higher growth expectations from a shifted fiscal policy regime, the
effect of higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve in the post-election period,
and expectations for lighter financial-sector regulation. In this discussion we
examine how well these factors explain the performance of financial equities since
the U.S. election.
As a first step, we calculate risk-adjusted returns (that is, alphas) from the capital
asset pricing model (CAPM). As shown in figure 2, many domestic financial
institutions earned significant abnormal returns in the post-election period. In
particular, large U.S. dealers and asset managers had the highest alphas.1 To
understand the factors that explain financial stocks’ abnormal performance, we
regress firms’ estimated alphas on three sets of explanatory variables:
1. Interest rates: Daily changes in the short-term interest rate (2-year
Treasury yield) and slope of the term structure (10-year minus 2-year yield),
2. Volatility: Daily changes in equity (VIX) and fixed-income (MOVE) volatility
indexes, and
3. Regulatory sentiment: Google search indexes for “Dodd-Frank Act” and
“deregulation.”

1 The alphas are estimated using the CAPM betas from the two-year period before the U.S.
election. For more information on the methodology, see Lubomir Petrasek, Sean Savage, and
Michael Ng (2017), “Explaining the Post-Election Surge in Financial Stocks,” staff memo, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, May 26.

Our analysis reveals that much of the post-election rally in financial stock prices can
be attributed to macroeconomic factors. Specifically, we find that investors in
financial stocks reacted positively to the higher level of short-term interest rates
and to the steepening term structure of interest rates over this period. These
interest rate factors alone explain more than 40 percent of the alphas of large U.S.
dealers and banks in the post-election period (figure 3). Presumably, these factors
tend to benefit banks and other lenders by increasing such firms’ expected net
interest margins on balance.
Although market volatility has declined, on net, since the election, volatility spiked
in the immediate aftermath of the election. We find that the temporary increases
in equity and fixed-income volatility after the election are also related to the post-
election alphas of U.S. dealers and asset managers. In theory, volatility should
benefit broker-dealers’ trading businesses through increased client activity, while
asset managers would potentially benefit from increased trading opportunities
and fund flows. Our regression results show that changes in volatility explain
about 20 percent of the time-series variation of U.S. dealers’ and asset managers’
abnormal performance since the election.
Finally, we find that our proxies of investor sentiment regarding the potential for
financial deregulation also played a statistically significant—albeit comparatively
small—role in explaining U.S. dealers’ and banks’ post-election alphas. In
particular, the indexes of Google searches for the topics “Dodd-Frank Act” and
“deregulation” explain about 5 percent of the abnormal performance of U.S.
dealers and banks in the post-election period. In contrast, we find that the post-
election performance of foreign dealers is not significantly related to our
sentiment indexes, likely because foreign dealers are perceived to be less exposed s
t
e
to U.S. regulatory developments. We note that our proxies are imperfect and thus k
r
are likely to understate the importance of regulatory sentiment on the stock price a

Foreign Developments
Since the June FOMC meeting, the primary force behind foreign asset price
movements has been central bank communications in the AFEs. Communications from
the Bank of Canada (BOC), the ECB, and the Bank of England variously highlighted the
improved economic outlook; the temporary nature of the recent weakness in inflation;
and, in the case of the United Kingdom, the persistence of above-target inflation. The
BOC raised its policy rate in the July meeting. On net, 10-year yields increased 27 basis
points in the United Kingdom and more than 30 basis points in Canada and Germany, and
2-year yields also increased notably.
The heightened focus on the potential for reduction in policy accommodation
abroad weighed on the value of the dollar against AFE currencies. The dollar depreciated
4 percent against the Canadian dollar, 1¾ percent against the euro, and 1½ percent s
t
e
against the British pound. The exception was a 3 percent appreciation of the dollar k
r
a
against the Japanese yen, as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) was viewed as least likely among M
l
a
AFE central banks to change its policy any time soon. The BOJ reaffirmed its ci
n
commitment to keeping Japanese 10-year bond yields near zero by conducting a fixed- a
n
Fi
rate purchase operation. The dollar edged down against EME currencies. Taken
together, the broad dollar depreciated ¾ percent, on net, over the period.
The performance of global equity prices and other risky assets was somewhat
mixed over the period. AFE equity prices were little changed, on net, while EME equity
prices edged up. European peripheral spreads narrowed over the period following
outcomes of the French parliamentary election, Greek debt negotiation, and the Italian
bank resolutions. (For more discussion, see the box “Implications of Recent Euro-Area
Bank Resolutions.”) EME sovereign spreads widened slightly, on net, while fund flows
into EMEs decreased somewhat but remained positive overall.

Implications of Recent Euro-Area Bank Resolutions
In June, EU authorities resolved three banks in the euro-area periphery—Banco Popular, a
medium-sized Spanish lender, and Banca Veneto and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, two small
Italian banks. In early July, they also authorized the rescue of a medium-sized Italian bank,
Monte dei Paschi (MPS), under a state-funded recapitalization plan. Because these bank
interventions are the first under the finalized rules of the EU banking union, they provide the
first signals about how EU authorities will apply the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
(BRRD) and how the union’s Single Resolution Board (SRB) will function. EU authorities used
different approaches in each case. This flexibility proved effective in containing negative
spillovers but also highlights shortcomings in the banking union’s rules and institutions.
All four banks had been under pressure to address capital and asset quality deficiencies for at
least one year before these interventions. MPS and Banco Popular were among the weakest
performers in the most recent EU-wide stress test, the results of which were released in mid-
2016. Subsequently, MPS failed to raise needed capital in private markets and was forced to
request state aid, while Banco Popular openly sought a merger or sale after an internal audit
revealed additional losses. The smaller Italian banks had struggled to raise capital since
shortfalls were initially identified in the 2014 EU-wide stress test. In the process, they
exhausted private aid provided through a support fund financed by other Italian banks.
In most instances, the resolution and recovery of banks in the euro area are governed by the
BRRD, a set of rules designed, in large part, to break the “doom loop” between bank rescues
and national budgets by placing restrictions on the provision of public funds. Under these
rules, at least 8 percent of a bank’s liabilities—including senior liabilities, if needed—have to
absorb losses (that is, be “bailed in”) before state aid can be considered. However, the
s
t
e framework allows for exceptions to the bail-in clause and gives EU authorities some discretion
k
r over how and to which banks they apply the rules. In tackling these cases, EU authorities relied
a
M
extensively on this flexibility. As a result, no senior creditors were bailed in, an event that many
l
a feared would lead to large negative spillovers.
ci
n
a
n
Fi Banco Popular was resolved under BRRD rules, with no exceptions, and sold for one euro. The
resolution was smoothed by the presence of a ready buyer, Santander, which agreed to raise
the private capital needed to absorb Popular’s assets in their entirety. As a result, no public
funds were used and bail-in of senior debt was not required.
The two small Italian banks were ruled as not systemically important by the SRB. This
distinction allowed EU authorities to take advantage of discretion within the framework to
avoid resolution under BRRD rules and to instead pursue resolution under national bankruptcy
procedures. Because Italian bankruptcy procedures do not require the 8 percent liability bail-in
minimum, senior liabilities of the two banks, along with their good assets, were sold to
domestic leader Intesa. To encourage Intesa to accept the deal, the Italian government
provided it with state funds and guarantees of up to €17 billion (1 percent of Italian GDP)
without the government taking an ownership stake.

--- Page 62 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 14, 2017
A plan to rescue (not resolve) MPS was approved under a BRRD exception called
“precautionary recapitalization.” This exception permits state aid for solvent banks that have
capital shortfalls under a stress test while protecting senior liabilities from bail-in. Unlike the
Intesa case, the injection of roughly €5 billion of state funds to MPS will give the Italian
government an ownership stake, estimated at 70 percent of the bank’s equity.
Market reaction to these interventions ranged from muted to positive. Bank share prices in
Spain, Italy, and the broader euro area rose, on average, after the resolution actions (figure 1).
Spreads of Italian and Spanish 10-year government bonds to German equivalents were also
stable or slightly narrower (figure 2). This market reaction contrasts markedly with previous
bouts of localized bank distress, which resulted in sizable negative spillovers to broader euro-
area bank equities and government bonds.
However, because these resolutions of medium- and small-sized banks were facilitated by the
presence of healthy buyers, it remains unclear whether EU authorities would be able to resolve
larger and more systemically important banks as smoothly. Moreover, EU authorities’
approaches to these first resolutions highlighted shortcomings in the banking union.
First, the supervisory framework is not yet as effective as envisioned. Although asset quality
and capital deficiencies at all four banks were identified, deficiencies were not adequately
remediated. In addition, supervisors were slow to declare the three resolved banks likely to
fail, a condition that triggers the resolution process. Second, significant amounts of state aid
were used in the Italian case, casting doubt on the willingness of EU authorities to use the
BRRD to break the doom loop between bank recapitalizations and national budgets. Finally,
the Italian resolutions highlight the lack of a European deposit guarantee program, which had
been proposed as an element of the banking union. In Italy, deposit insurance is largely funded
after the fact with contributions from domestic banks. Absent public funds, the remaining s
t
e
banks would have had to cover the losses of the failed banks’ insured depositors—which many k
r
Italian lenders, weakened by bad loans and thin capital buffers, reportedly could ill afford. a

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
The effective federal funds rate rose in line with the 25 basis point increase in the
target range and held steady near the middle of the target range except on the quarter-end
date. Overnight Eurodollar rates closely tracked the effective federal funds rate, while
overnight Treasury repo rates continue to be just a little above the offering rate on the
Federal Reserve overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations. Meanwhile,
continuing the trend seen throughout this FOMC tightening cycle, retail MMF yields
increased only a fraction of the policy rate increase. And, unlike the rates on other
money market instruments, shorter-dated Treasury bills did not rise in response to the
target range hike, which reportedly is partially attributable to a reduction in Treasury bill
supply associated with sizable corporate tax payments in June.
Over the intermeeting period, ON RRP take-up averaged $196 billion except on
the June quarter-end date, when take-up increased to $399 billion, reflecting a temporary
surge in participation by both prime and government MMFs.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households in the second
quarter have generally continued to be supportive of growth in spending and investment.
However, respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending
Practices (SLOOS) in July continued to report weaker demand for business loans from
banks and tighter lending standards for commercial real estate (CRE) and consumer loans
on balance.
 Net fundraising by nonfinancial firms slowed somewhat in June, bringing
overall second-quarter net borrowing in line with the moderate first-quarter
pace. A reduction in corporate bond issuance and continued sluggish
commercial and industrial (C&I) lending were offset by a rebound in net
originations of institutional leveraged loan.
 Financing conditions for CRE transactions and projects remained
accommodative, with loan growth at banks only gradually moderating amid
reports of tightening credit standards, particularly for construction and land
development loans.
 In municipal bond markets, there was little broad-market imprint from Puerto
Rico’s filing for court-supervised debt restructuring or from Illinois’s
tumultuous budget negotiations.
 Overall, consumer credit continued to grow at a moderate pace in recent
months despite ongoing tightening of lending standards—especially for
nonprime borrowers—reported by banks.
 Residential mortgage credit remained broadly available, and flows of new
credit have continued at a moderate pace.

rate spreads narrowing somewhat further for both bonds and bank loans. Gross issuance
of corporate bonds stepped down in June from a torrid pace in May. In contrast,
institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be robust through June.
C&I lending by banks remained quite weak in the second quarter, with lending by
domestic banks continuing to grow slowly and lending by foreign banks continuing to
contract somewhat. Responses from the SLOOS indicated that depressed demand was
largely responsible, and that banks’ standards were little changed. The most cited reason
for the lackluster loan demand was decreased investment by nonfinancial businesses, but
banks also reported that some borrowers were shifting to other sources of financing or to
using internally generated funds. Banks also reported in the SLOOS that standards for
most C&I loan categories were on the easier end of the range that has prevailed
since 2005.
Credit quality of nonfinancial corporations generally remained favorable over the
intermeeting period, with relatively few upgrades or downgrades logged in June. The
trailing six-month bond default rate remained near its lowest level since 2014, and
aggregate expected year-ahead defaults implied by Moody’s KMV were little changed,
on net, in recent months, although expected defaults for oil firms increased a bit.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations was solid in the second
quarter, mostly reflecting robust seasoned equity offerings. The volumes of announced
share repurchases and of announced and completed mergers and acquisitions deals in the
second quarter all decreased relative to year-ago levels.
With few actual earnings reports on hand, second-quarter earnings for S&P 500
firms are expected to increase modestly relative to the first quarter (on a seasonally
adjusted basis), which implies robust earnings growth over year-ago levels. The outlook
for corporate earnings remains favorable, and projections by Wall Street analysts for
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 companies were essentially unrevised last month.

Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for CRE remained accommodative, though loan growth at
banks has moderated somewhat amid reports of tightening credit standards, particularly
in construction and land development—the riskiest loan category. Banks also reported
that the levels of standards on CRE loans were on the tight end of their historical range,
and that, on net, demand for CRE loans has been weakening in recent months. Issuance
of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) through the first half of the year has
been similar to the pace seen last year. Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools
originated before the crisis have continued to increase as these loans mature and fail to
refinance. These delinquencies have largely been expected by market participants and
have had no material effect to date on credit availability or other market conditions (see
the box “What Are the Implications of the Sharp Rise in the Delinquency Rate for
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities in This Market?” in the March Tealbook).
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on
balance, and neither Puerto Rico’s filing for court-supervised debt restructuring nor
Illinois’s tumultuous budget negotiations left a noticeable imprint on the broader
municipal bond market.1 Gross bond issuance by state and local governments remained
solid in June but was lower than a year ago. Yields on 20-year municipal bonds and their
ratios over comparable-maturity Treasury yields were little changed relative to the time
of the June FOMC meeting. On net, the credit quality of state and local governments
deteriorated somewhat in June as credit rating downgrades outpaced upgrades, mostly
reflecting reduced ratings on Illinois-related municipal bonds.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative
for most potential borrowers over the intermeeting period, and flows of new credit have
continued at a moderate pace. However, growth of loans on banks’ books has slowed n s
o
somewhat in the first half of this year. This slowdown appears to have been partly driven ti
di
n
by a continuing shift of credit toward government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and

C

the past two years. Although a budget proposal was passed in early July over the governor’s veto, Illinois’s a

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, as aggregate originations of home-
purchase mortgages have continued to rise. SLOOS respondents, on net, reported that
standards on most loan categories were little changed. Residential mortgage rates
increased toward the end of the intermeeting period, in line with yields on longer-term
Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), but remain low by historical standards.
Consumer Credit
Consumer credit continued to grow at a moderate rate on a year-over-year basis,
notwithstanding the upward drift in interest rates. Credit card and auto lending appear to
have moved out of the more rapid expansion phase of the credit cycle that was evident
through the end of last year. The less exuberant financing conditions in consumer credit
markets appear to be, in part, a response to rising delinquency rates for some categories
of loans, particularly for subprime borrowers. In the July SLOOS, banks, on net,
reported having tightened standards and widened spreads for auto and credit card loans,
and the level of standards was reported as being particularly tight for the subprime
segments of these loan types. Reflecting in part continued tightening of lending
standards, consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter;
however, that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions.
Finally, the issuance of consumer ABS remained robust in recent months amid tight
spreads on such securities.

We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic activity as s
k
s
being in line, on balance, with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by Ri
the FOMC. On the one hand, many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted
as reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty—including options-based indexes of
expected stock market volatility (such as the VIX) and corporate bond spreads—remain
subdued, and we still see less uncertainty associated with the foreign economic outlook
than late last year. On the other hand, we judge that notable uncertainty remains about
the future direction of some federal government policies.
The box “New Measures of Upside and Downside Risks to the Economic
Outlook” and the exhibit that accompanies it present quantitative estimates of the
distribution of risks around the staff outlook, conditional on available indicators of
economic activity, inflation, financial stress, and macroeconomic volatility. The current
estimates of the conditional distribution of risks around the staff forecasts for GDP
growth and for the unemployment rate are not especially wide compared with what they
have been over the past two decades, nor are they particularly skewed.
Consistent with those estimates, we continue to judge the risks around our
medium-term projections for both GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
As in the previous Tealbook, we consider the risks to our outlook associated with
monetary policy possibly having to return to the effective lower bound (ELB) as having
receded substantially from earlier in the recovery. Based on stochastic simulations in the
FRB/US model around the current baseline forecast, we estimate that the probability of
returning to the ELB sometime over the next three years is close to the steady-state value
shown in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate.”1
1 As noted in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section, we lowered our
assumption for the long-run equilibrium rate of interest (r*) in this forecast. Because r* is the intercept
term in the baseline monetary policy rule, the assumed path for the federal funds rate is lower and, in turn,
both the projected trajectory of the ELB risk probability and its steady-state value are now higher. (The
methodology for calculating this probability was described in the box “A Guidepost for Dropping Effective
Lower Bound Risk from the Assessment of Risks” in the April 2017 Tealbook.)

e In this discussion, we describe a recently developed framework that provides estimates of the
c
n magnitudes of upside and downside risks to key variables in the staff’s baseline forecasts.1 By
U
& examining the historical record of staff forecast errors through the lens of a statistical model, we
s
k find that several contemporaneously available macroeconomic and financial market indexes are
s
Ri significant indicators of risks to the forecasts. This evidence provides a foundation for our new
measures that gauge the risks to current economic forecasts.
To accommodate potentially asymmetric risks to the forecasts, our framework assumes that
forecast errors for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and headline CPI inflation follow
“double normal” distributions with particular shapes that vary over time. An example of this
distribution is shown in figure 1. In contrast to a standard (symmetric) normal distribution, the
double normal distribution allows downside risk to be governed by a parameter σ that can be
down
different from the parameter that governs upside risk, σ . In the figure, downside risk is plotted
up
to be greater than upside risk, although this skew could be reversed.2 We use standard statistical
techniques to estimate (1) how both σ and σ for staff forecast errors at a four‐quarter
down up
horizon have varied over time using historical staff forecast errors from 1986 to 2016 and (2) the
extent to which that variation was correlated with a set of indexes summarizing macroeconomic
and financial market conditions that were available contemporaneously.
The indexes that we find to be most useful for estimating risks to the staff forecasts are shown in
figure 2. In panel A, an index of several real activity indicators is plotted. Our estimates suggest
that forecasts constructed when this index is low (for example, during recessions) tend to have
more pronounced downside risk for GDP growth and greater upside risk for the unemployment
rate. Panel B shows an index of inflation. We found that when this index is relatively high, the

Staff Baseline Forecast,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research
and Statistics, July 12.
2 That the distribution of staff forecast errors may be asymmetric does not imply that the forecasts are
biased or inefficient. Indeed, our analysis maintains the assumption that the staff’s assessment of the modal
outcomes for macroeconomic variables is correct, implying that the mode of forecast errors is always zero.

upside risk to the forecast for headline CPI inflation tends to be elevated. Panel C shows an index
of financial market indicators. When this indicator is low (in periods of elevated financial stress),
downside risks to the GDP growth forecast and upside risks to the unemployment rate forecast
tend to be exacerbated. Panel D shows an indicator of macroeconomic uncertainty. This index
gauges the average month‐to‐month volatility of more than 100 macroeconomic series. We
found that when this index is elevated, the confidence intervals for all three macroeconomic
forecasts are wider, with upside risks to the staff’s inflation and unemployment rate forecasts
and downside risks to the staff’s forecast for GDP growth being especially affected.3
The exhibit “Time‐Varying Macroeconomic Risk” presents time‐series estimates of risks to the
staff baseline economic forecasts that were generated using our new framework. As shown in
the top panel, upside risk to the forecast for the unemployment rate is estimated to vary
substantially over time, from about ½ percentage point during quiescent periods to more than
2 percentage points during periods of turbulence. In contrast, downside risk to the
unemployment rate forecast appears to be relatively stable over time. As shown in the middle
panel, upside risk for the staff’s GDP growth forecast is estimated to fluctuate moderately around
2 percentage points. However, downside risk tends to occasionally surge, with the lower edge of
the interval plunging from typical levels of around negative 2 percentage points to around
negative 4 percentage points or lower at certain times. The bottom panel shows the distribution
of staff forecast errors for inflation. Upside risk for inflation is estimated to vary more strongly
over time than downside risk, with upside risk increasing primarily during periods of heightened
macroeconomic volatility.
3 Other instruments that we tested but found to have less explanatory power included measures of
economic policy uncertainty and survey‐based measures of expected future economic activity.

With regard to inflation, we still see the current level of uncertainty around our
y
projection as in line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside t
n
ai
and upside as balanced; this assessment is consistent with the new quantitative estimates t
r
e
of the conditional distribution of inflation forecast risks shown in the exhibit “Time- n c
U
Varying Macroeconomic Risk.” To the downside, the recent run of soft inflation &
s
readings could prove more persistent than we have assumed. Also, the Michigan survey k
s
Ri
measure of longer-run inflation expectations has drifted down in recent years and remains
relatively low, although other survey-based indicators of longer-run inflation expectations
have not moved down. In addition, U.S. monetary policy normalization could generate a
more substantial appreciation of the dollar than we have anticipated in the baseline
forecast. To the upside, with the economy projected to be operating above its long-run
potential, inflation may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the
predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities in the U.S.
financial system as moderate. Vulnerabilities stemming from asset valuation pressures
have increased from a “notable” to an “elevated” level. That assessment is driven
primarily by high price-to-earnings ratios and low implied volatility in equity markets, a
further narrowing of corporate bond spreads, and historically low commercial real estate
capitalization rates. However, these valuation pressures have not been accompanied by
an increase in other financial vulnerabilities. Borrowing in the nonfinancial sector
continues to increase at only about the same pace as nominal GDP growth. While
leverage among corporations remains elevated, borrowing by the riskiest firms has
slowed in recent years. Vulnerabilities from leverage in the financial system continue to
be low, as capital positions at banks and at insurance companies are high by historical
standards. Vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity transformation also remain low,
partly because large bank holding companies continue to maintain historically high levels
of liquid assets and the use of short-term wholesale funding still has not picked up.
Moreover, money market fund reforms still appear to have reduced run risk, as assets
under management at potentially riskier alternatives to prime money market funds have
not grown rapidly.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
y
t
n
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the ai
t
r
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario explores the e
c
n
effects of combining two factors: a stronger positive response of wages to tightening U
&
labor market conditions and less-well-anchored long-run inflation expectations. In the s
k
s
second scenario, we consider the implications of lower long-run inflation expectations. Ri
The third scenario presents outcomes associated with a lower natural rate of
unemployment, where policymakers and the staff only gradually recognize the deviation
from the baseline. The fourth scenario illustrates the possible economic consequences of
a substantial correction of asset values in both the equity and bond markets. In the fifth
scenario, we analyze the effects of stronger foreign economic growth in combination with
a faster normalization of monetary policy in AFEs. The last scenario contemplates the
possibility that a slowdown in China’s economy triggers financial turbulence in other
EMEs, with significant spillovers to the global economy.
We simulate these scenarios using two staff models.2 Except where noted, the
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline. The size and
composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the
scenarios.
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]
Despite the tight labor and product markets in the baseline forecast, core PCE
price inflation is projected to reach 2 percent only in 2019. This outlook is consistent
with the combination of a flat Phillips curve and well-anchored long-run inflation
expectations—features incorporated in both the judgmental analytical apparatus and the
FRB/US model. However, some recent research suggests that the relationship between
labor utilization and wage growth (and, in turn, price inflation in the FRB/US model)
may be stronger when the labor market is tight.3 This scenario captures that risk by

economy, and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

Under these circumstances, inflation increases to 2½ percent by 2019 and to

s
increases more rapidly than in the baseline; real longer-term interest rates are also slightly
Ri
higher. As a result, real GDP growth is a bit slower and the trajectory for the
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher by the end of 2022.
Lower Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]
The Michigan survey measure of median longer-run inflation expectations has
trended down and is at a low level by the historical standards of this series. In this
scenario, we assume that the downtrend in the Michigan survey measure is an indication
that the longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting are
½ percentage point lower than in the baseline in the second quarter of 2017. Thereafter,
those expectations are affected by the economy’s experience of inflation to a greater
extent than in the baseline. Eventually, the conduct of monetary policy drives actual
inflation and, hence, inflation expectations into line with the FOMC’s 2 percent
objective.
Under these assumptions, headline inflation is 1¼ percent at an annual rate in the
second half of 2017 and rises to only 1¾ percent by the end of 2019, ¼ percentage point
below the baseline. Inflation remains persistently below the 2 percent target in part
because the baseline policy rule is quite inertial. The federal funds rate runs about
¼ percentage point lower than the baseline for several years.
Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment with Misperception [FRB/US]
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate will fall slightly
below 4 percent in 2019, around 1 percentage point below the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate of unemployment. However, the natural rate is estimated with considerable
4 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the
current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of the increase reflects a comparison between
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

y
unemployment has been 4 percent for the past few years and will remain at that level in t
n
ai
the future. We also assume that policymakers’ and the staff’s perceptions of the natural t

Because the lower natural rate—along with the correspondingly higher level of
Ri
potential—are not fully recognized until near the end of the simulation period, the lower
path of the unemployment rate is (incorrectly) perceived as implying a more positive
output gap than in the baseline, prompting a higher federal funds rate, all else being
equal. As events unfold in this scenario, the slightly tighter stance of policy over the next
few years holds real GDP growth below the baseline for some time. However, as
policymakers and the staff come to recognize that resource utilization is less tight than
they had initially perceived, the federal funds rate eventually moves below the baseline.
GDP growth rises a touch above the baseline forecast in 2021, while the unemployment
rate is ½ percentage point below it. Inflation falls a shade below the Tealbook projection
by the end of 2018.
Market Correction [FRB/US]
Broad equity market indexes have increased significantly since last year, even as
common measures of future corporate profitability have not improved much. Standard
equity valuation measures, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, suggest elevated valuation
pressures. Similarly, both investment-grade and high-yield bond spreads currently are
near their lowest levels since the financial crisis. While some of the decline in bond
spreads reflects improvements in the credit quality of bond issuers, estimates of bond risk
premiums suggest that bondholders are now more willing to take on risk.
In this scenario, we assume that equity and bond risk premiums return more
quickly to historically normal levels. By mid-2018, equity prices fall about 16 percent,
while the term premium on Treasury securities rises halfway to its assumed long-run
value. At the same time, the triple-B corporate bond spread rises about 30 basis points
above the baseline, enough to move it back close to its median historical value.
Economic activity is further curtailed by an erosion in consumer and business sentiment.
Primarily reflecting the deterioration in sentiment assumed in this scenario, real
GDP growth slows to about 1½ percent in 2018, roughly ¾ percentage point less than in

k s Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy [SIGMA]
s
Ri
Our baseline forecast envisions monetary policy normalization abroad—
especially in the major AFEs—to occur slowly as central banks remain attentive to
downside risks, particularly to inflation. However, the ongoing strength in economic
indicators could signal more buoyant foreign economic growth and lead to higher
inflation than is currently in the baseline, inducing foreign central banks to embark on
markedly faster policy tightening. In this scenario, we assume that foreign GDP growth
runs at over 3 percent per year in the second half of 2017 and in 2018, about
¾ percentage point above the baseline. In addition, we assume that the improved outlook
prompts AFE central banks to tighten their policy rates more aggressively than what is
prescribed by the baseline policy rule. Higher interest rates abroad—including from a
rise in term premiums—along with some reversal of earlier flight-to-safety flows into
U.S. assets contribute to a 10 percent depreciation of the broad real dollar.
Despite the sharp tightening of monetary policy abroad and some spillovers of
that tightening into U.S. interest rates, U.S. activity benefits as stronger foreign growth
and the weaker dollar boost net exports. U.S. real GDP expands, on average, 2¼ percent
in 2018 and 2019, about ¼ percentage point more than in the baseline. The
unemployment rate falls to around 3½ percent by the end of 2019. Higher import prices
and greater resource pressures cause core PCE price inflation to rise noticeably above
2 percent in 2018 and 2019. The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the
baseline, increasing to 3¾ percent by the end of 2019.
China-Driven EME Turbulence [SIGMA]
In our baseline forecast, we expect Chinese real GDP growth to gradually
moderate from about 7 percent in the first half of this year to a still-solid 5¾ percent pace
by the end of 2019. However, given China’s underlying vulnerabilities—including high
corporate debt and a large and opaque shadow banking system—adverse shocks could
trigger a quicker and more pronounced slowdown of Chinese GDP growth and renewed
pressures on the renminbi, with negative spillovers to other EMEs. This scenario
assumes that such a risk materializes. GDP growth in China and other EMEs falls to only

to tighten monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on inflation arising from the

The appreciation of the dollar, weaker foreign economic activity, and adverse
financial spillovers cause U.S. GDP growth to slow to about 1 percent in 2018 and the
unemployment rate to rise to 4½ percent in 2019. Weaker economic activity and lower
import prices reduce core PCE price inflation to about 1¼ percent in 2018. The federal
funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, rising to 2½ percent by the end
of 2019.
5 In our baseline forecast, GDP growth in other EMEs (that is, ex China) is projected to be about
2¾ percent in 2018.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
t
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with
those in the Tealbook baseline. The simple rules and optimal control exercises reviewed
here prescribe lower trajectories for the federal funds rate now than they did at the time of
the June Tealbook. These changes mainly reflect two adjustments to the staff projection.
First, the outlook for inflation is a bit weaker in the near term. Second, and more
important, the staff lowered, by 50 basis points, its assessment of the real federal funds
rate expected to prevail in the longer run. The box “The Equilibrium Real Rate in the
Longer Run” discusses some of the estimates of the real federal funds rate in the long run
that informed the staff’s decision to lower its assessment. Even with these changes, most
simple rules and optimal control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal
funds rate over the next few years than is assumed in the staff forecast.
In this Tealbook, we have reintroduced a nominal income (NI) targeting rule to
the set of simple policy rules routinely considered. Under the NI targeting rule, monetary
policy reacts to the gap between the level of actual nominal GDP and some
predetermined level. In addition to minimizing the output and contemporaneous or
projected inflation gaps (in common with other rules), this rule seeks to make up for past
misses in inflation. Accordingly, the amount of stimulus that NI targeting delivers
depends importantly on the target path for nominal GDP and, in particular, on the initial
deviation in nominal GDP that policymakers seek to offset. The version of the NI
targeting rule considered here seeks to make up for the cumulative shortfall in nominal
GDP growth since 2011:Q4, just before the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation
objective. The target for NI rises at a rate consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent
inflation objective and the staff’s estimate of the path of real potential output; as a result,
the NI targeting rule with a 2011:Q4 anchor inherits an NI shortfall of about 2 percent in
the current quarter.1 This shortfall arises principally from the fact that, since 2011:Q4,
inflation has run below the 2 percent objective.2
1 The Monetary Policy Strategies section of the March 2016 Tealbook B illustrated the importance
of the anchor date in NI targeting rules.
2 The NI shortfall reflects an inflation gap of about 3 percentage points, which is only partially
offset by a positive real GDP gap of 1 percent.

The Equilibrium Real Rate in the Longer Run
The equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate in the longer run is the rate consistent with
the economy operating at its potential once the cyclical effects of economic shocks have abated.
This “longer-run equilibrium real rate,” along with the Committee’s inflation objective,
determines the longer-run level of the nominal federal funds rate and other interest rates in the
staff’s economic models. The longer-run equilibrium real rate is also a parameter in simple policy
rules, including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in the Monetary Policy Strategies
section.1
Since June 2014, the staff has, in several steps, lowered its assumption for the longer-run
equilibrium real rate from 2 percent to ½ percent, including a 50 basis point reduction in this
s
e
gi Tealbook. The median and range of the longer-run level of the real federal funds rate implied by
e FOMC participants’ projections reported in the Summary of Economic Projections have also

highlights that the estimates from the two models have remained low in recent years. In
particular, the most recent estimate from Laubach and Williams is near zero, and the Johannsen-
Mertens model places substantial probability on a longer-run equilibrium real rate that is less
than 1 percent.
Although the Laubach-Williams and Johannsen-Mertens modeling approaches are not identical,
they have the common feature that they use time-series methods to model the co-movements of
major variables like inflation, interest rates, output, and unemployment to infer the longer-run
equilibrium interest rate. Both approaches suggest very low estimates of the longer-run
equilibrium interest rate. This finding has been corroborated by a variety of studies that use
either data or methodologies that are substantially different. For instance, Gagnon, Johannsen,
and Lopez-Salido (2016), in a study emphasizing the role of demographics, have estimated the
longer-run equilibrium rate at about ½ percent and have suggested that demographic trends will

continue to be a source of downward pressure on rates for some time. Christensen and
Rudebusch (2017) provide an alternative perspective by inferring the longer-run equilibrium
interest rate mainly from financial market data. Their point estimate is also near zero, and they
too predict that the rate is “more likely than not” to remain low in the near term (p. 4).3
Furthermore, “model free” measures, such as the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities five-
year, five-year-forward rate, remain low, though its movements could reflect changes in term
premiums.
In addition to the estimates discussed previously, we summarize, with the yellow bar in the
figure, a range of point estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate from a collection of empirical
studies. The range of point estimates spans from almost 0 to 1¾ percent. Taken together, these
studies indicate that the staff’s current assumption for the longer-run equilibrium rate is well
within the range of empirical estimates, especially given that each of these estimates is subject
to considerable uncertainty. As the figure illustrates, the uncertainty bands around the longer-
run equilibrium real rate in the Johannsen-Mertens model are large. Therefore, each study taken
individually is only modestly informative about plausible values of the longer-run equilibrium rate,
but the concordance of estimates using different data and modeling assumptions is somewhat
reassuring.

NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), a first-difference rule, and the NI targeting rule.3
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output gap and
inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels, and, except for the first-difference
rule, use the staff’s revised assumption for the longer-run real federal funds rate of
50 basis points in the intercept term. The top and middle panels also provide the path for
the federal funds rate used in the staff baseline, which is derived using an inertial version
s
e of the Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary adjustment to the intercept. Because this
gi
e
t adjustment is small, the baseline rule provides essentially the same path for the federal

r
t funds rate as the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule without such adjustment, which

M made in the June Tealbook because of both lower projected inflation and the
downward revision to the real federal funds rate in the long term. The
prescriptions from these rules, which do not feature interest rate smoothing
terms, remain well above the Tealbook baseline policy path.
• The near-term prescriptions of the first-difference rule are a little lower than in
June, reflecting minor changes to the staff’s projection of the output gap over
the next few quarters.
• The NI targeting rule calls for values of the federal funds rate below the
baseline Tealbook projection, primarily reflecting the cumulative shortfall in
inflation since the end of 2011. These prescriptions are also lower than those
that would have been made using the NI targeting rule under the June
Tealbook projection because weak inflation readings since then have widened
the NI gap in the near term.

A MEDIUM-TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model given
the staff’s baseline projection. This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• The current-quarter estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is about
5 basis points lower than the one based on information from the time of the
June Tealbook, reflecting a small downward revision to the trajectory of the
output gap over the next few years.4
• At 2.16 percent, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is a little more than
1½ percentage points above the staff’s estimate of the real federal funds rate
in the longer run. In addition, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is nearly
1½ percentage points above the average projected real federal funds rate in the
staff forecast for the same 12-quarter period.
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is
below the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction
function used by the staff in constructing the baseline forecast includes an
interest rate smoothing term and reacts to both the output gap and inflation
deviations from 2 percent and is therefore not designed to close the output gap
over exactly three years.
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and
the NI targeting rule.5 These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output
4 The revision to the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*, a medium-term concept, is smaller than the
revision to the staff’s estimate of the real federal funds rate in the longer run. A key reason is that the
revision only has a moderate effect on the staff’s assessment of medium-term economic dynamics.
5 The simulated paths for each policy rule are obtained under the assumptions that policymakers
are committed to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial market participants,
price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through on this commitment
but also understand the macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.

1. Where applicable, the intercepts of rules conditional on the current and previous Tealbook projections are 0.5 percent and
1 percent, respectively. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous
Tealbook projection" report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but
conditional on the current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period
(beginning in the current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The
"average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same 12−quarter period
as the Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*.

gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified
policy rules.6
• The policy rate path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a minor downward adjustment to the intercept.
The federal funds rate increases, on average, about 1 percentage point per year
in 2017 and 2018 and reaches 3 percent in the middle of 2019. The pace of
tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at almost
4 percent in 2021 before moving toward its long-run level of 2½ percent.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate tightening in
policy. However, this tightening is less pronounced than in recent Tealbooks
because of the revision to the real longer-term federal funds rate, which
affects the intercept of these rules. For the Taylor (1999) rule, the real federal
funds rate lies above the Tealbook baseline through 2021, leading to a higher
real 10-year Treasury yield through the early part of the simulation.
Consistent with tighter financial conditions, the unemployment rate is higher
than under the Tealbook baseline through the middle of 2021. The
Taylor (1993) rule calls for lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over
the period shown because the first of these two rules responds less strongly to
the projected rise in output above its potential level over the next several
years. Later in the simulation period, the real federal funds rate falls below
the Tealbook baseline for a sustained period. Market participants anticipate
these lower rates and, as a result, the real 10-year Treasury yield is lower than
the Tealbook baseline path over most of the simulation period. The more
accommodative financial conditions are associated with a higher trajectory for
inflation and, eventually, a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate than
under the Tealbook baseline.
• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower path for
some years thereafter. This latter divergence occurs because the first-
difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap
rather than to its level, reacts to the projected narrowing of the output gap late
6 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

in the decade and beyond. The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2018,
in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies
lower longer-term real rates over the entire projection period than in the
Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of resource utilization and
inflation. Thus, the first-difference rule generates outcomes for the
unemployment rate that are below those associated with the baseline policy
rule and inflation outcomes that are above those in the Tealbook baseline
projection.
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the
federal funds rate than the other rules because the NI targeting rule seeks to
compensate for the cumulative shortfall of growth in the GDP deflator since
the end of 2011. Because we assume that the commitment to closing this gap
is credible, economic agents correctly anticipate this long period of low rates,
leading to higher inflation and lower real 10-year Treasury rates than under
the other policy rules and the Tealbook baseline. The path for the
unemployment rate is substantially lower than for all the other simulations
shown, reaching a minimum of 3¼ percent in the middle of 2020.
• The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are lower than those conditional
on the June Tealbook projection, reflecting the downward revisions to the real
federal funds rate in the long run and to the near-term inflation forecast.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix in this Tealbook’s

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices, which
may improve economic outcomes.8
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path. This higher path arises
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome
that these policymakers judge to be costly. The tighter policy results in a path
for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of
the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the
Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited
response of inflation to changes in levels of resource utilization in the
FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal
weights; it is also below the Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric
loss function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered
by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that
helps achieve this outcome. Because the public believes that policymakers
will follow through on this policy rate path even as the unemployment rate
8 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ to take actions that will not be optimal from
the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). Moreover, these
promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants. However,
under the alternative assumption of optimal policy under discretion, which does not rely on the credibility
of policymakers’ promises, the results only differ significantly in the simulation in which there is an
asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.

substantially undershoots its natural rate, the tighter labor market brings
inflation to 2 percent somewhat more quickly than in the case of equal
weights. Starting around 2025 (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a
little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers seek to contain
the inflationary pressures stemming from a prolonged period with limited
resource slack.9
• The third simulation exercise, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a
loss function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is
five times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
s
e identical. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative
gi
e
t than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with
a
r
S t undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years. The reason
y
c is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff
li
o
P because inflation responds only weakly to resource utilization. Hence,
y
r
a policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the
t
e
n natural rate of unemployment, which this specification of the loss function
o
M
sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but
that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than
under the specification with equal weights in an effort to undo the projected
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment; the federal funds rate
remains near 6 percent over much of the remainder of the period shown. The
paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 10-year Treasury yield are
also notably higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights.
Because of the flat Phillips curve in FRB/US, this policy leaves the trajectory
9 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time-inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to re-optimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function. For the other three
specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under commitment and discretion are not much
different from one another.

for inflation close to those of all except one of the other loss functions over
the period shown, even though it keeps the unemployment rate close to the
staff’s estimate of the natural rate.10
• With the exception of the simulation with a minimal weight on rate
adjustments, the federal funds rate paths prescribed by optimal control under
the above loss functions are about ¼ percentage point lower, on average, than
in the June Tealbook over the period shown, reflecting lower projected
inflation in the near term and the revision to the real longer-run federal
funds rate.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described above.
10 After 2022, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes above and
sometimes below the case of equal weights.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic
implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as commitment
strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES”
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives the expressions for the four simple policy
rules reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. The table also reports the expression for
the inertial Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses an intercept-adjusted version of that rule in the
construction of the Tealbook baseline projection. denotes the nominal federal funds rate for
quarter t. The right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core

change in the output gap (∆4ygap ). The value of policymakers’ longer-run inflation objective,
t+3|t
denoted πLR, is 2 percent.
The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined
as the difference between nominal income, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of the
level of nominal GDP, and a target value, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q∗4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently,
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of
potential GDP. These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the
sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level
it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 The intercepts of these four rules, denoted ,
are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objecti𝐿𝐿v𝐿𝐿e

and a longer-run real federal funds rate of 0.5 percent.3 The prescriptions of the first-difference
rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the Tealbook is published early in a
quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters. When the Tealbook is

minal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.

published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters. Rules that
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. To isolate the effects of
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate. The “Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model
of the U.S. economy.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The measure is
derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based expectations—that is,
agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future variables are
determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and
the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close
the output gap at the end of this time frame, whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal
funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the

simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
price inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps

specifications of the loss function.

The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
