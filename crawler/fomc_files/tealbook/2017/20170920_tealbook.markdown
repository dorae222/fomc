Notwithstanding the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey, national output DD

and employment still look on track to post above-trend increases this year.1 Real GDP oo

EE
rose at a solid pace in the second quarter—and by more than we had estimated in the July cc
ttii
ss
Tealbook—following a lackluster first quarter. Smoothing through the quarterly swings ee
mm
in activity likely to be induced by Harvey, we expect output growth to average 3 percent oo
DD
at an annual rate in the second half of this year. On this forecast, real GDP will rise to
nearly 1½ percent above potential by year’s end, slightly more than in the July Tealbook.
Labor market conditions have also continued to tighten, largely as expected, with payroll
employment gains through August running well above the pace required to absorb the
trend growth in the labor force. The unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent in August, has
moved down 0.3 percentage point on net since the end of last year, and we expect it to
decline a little further over the remainder of the year.
Beyond this year, we expect real GDP growth to slow gradually—to 2¼ percent
in 2018, 2 percent in 2019, and 1½ percent in 2020—as monetary policy tightens. We
anticipate this slowing despite the small boost to growth from expansionary fiscal policy
that we continue to assume will begin next year. Altogether, GDP stands a bit more than
2 percent above potential by the end of 2019, a touch higher than in the July Tealbook.
In 2020, with GDP rising less quickly than potential, the output gap begins to narrow.
The unemployment rate is projected to fall to 3.7 percent in 2019 and then to hold at that
level in 2020, about 1 percentage point below our revised estimate of its natural rate.
Smoothing through hurricane-related effects, our forecast for inflation is about
unrevised. Although the incoming data on consumer prices through July again surprised
us slightly to the downside, we expect the monthly readings on core PCE price inflation
to pick up modestly in the second half of this year as recent low readings prove transitory
and rising core import prices pass through to domestic consumer prices. As resource
utilization tightens further and the anomalously low inflation readings of this year are not

weekend. More than 19 million Floridians live in the projected path of Hurricane Irma, including the
Miami and Tampa metropolitan areas.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
e
D
the June FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection
n
o with the one we presented in the June Tealbook.
c
E
c
ti
Since June, we have revised up our projection for the increase in real GDP slightly in 2017 and
s
e
m by a similar amount over the next few years. This upward revision comes despite the fact
o that in the July Tealbook we reduced the size of our assumed fiscal policy expansion. The
D
unemployment rate falls somewhat more than in the June forecast and stands at 3.7 percent
at the end of 2020, reflecting both the somewhat faster pace of GDP growth and a
0.1 percentage point downward revision to our estimate of the natural rate to 4.8 percent.
On balance, resource utilization, as measured by the gap between the unemployment rate
and its natural rate, is a little tighter in this projection.
The news since June led to a slightly lower forecast for core PCE price inflation this year, but
as we continue to view this year’s weak inflation readings as importantly reflecting
idiosyncratic and transitory factors, inflation is essentially unrevised thereafter. Total PCE
inflation is still projected to move up modestly, reaching 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.
Despite showing a marginally tighter GDP gap, the federal funds rate path from the
intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline forecast is below
that of the June Tealbook, reflecting a downward revision to our estimate of r*. 1

Hurricane Harvey ee
DD
nn
Historic rainfall and widespread flooding from Hurricane Harvey have profoundly oo
cc
EE
altered the lives of many individuals and severely disrupted economic activity in
cc
ttii
Houston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, and other communities along the ss
ee
mm
Gulf Coast. The full extent of the personal loss and property damage is still unknown, oo
DD
and with only limited data available, any estimate of Hurricane Harvey’s effect on the
economy will necessarily be tentative.
We currently estimate that Hurricane Harvey will subtract ½ percentage point at
an annual rate from GDP growth in the third quarter.2 As the level of production returns
to its normal pre-hurricane path and a small portion of lost spending is made up, we
anticipate a slightly larger boost to growth in the fourth quarter. Our review of past
hurricanes suggests that the makeup of the lost spending and production, as well as some
rebuilding of damaged property, will be gradual and stretch over several years. Thus, the
anticipated effect of Hurricane Harvey on the contour of growth in our medium-term
forecast is negligible in any particular year.
 The disruption of energy and petrochemical production is the largest
single channel by which Hurricane Harvey is adversely affecting
economic activity. Several large oil refineries and petrochemical plants
along the Gulf Coast of Texas were in the path of the storm. At the peak
of the storm’s impact, 21 percent of U.S. refining capacity was offline, and
another 8 percent was operating at reduced capacity. In addition, about
60 percent of U.S. petrochemical capacity was shut down, and crude oil
and natural gas production also slowed in the region.3 We estimate that
the net loss in production in the energy and petrochemical sectors will
subtract roughly 2 percentage points at an annual rate from the growth of
2 Our estimate of Hurricane Harvey’s economic effect draws on analysis of previous hurricanes,
specifics of the affected Gulf Coast economy, information collected by the Federal Reserve Banks
(including Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond), and high-frequency data on production and spending. For more
details, see the August 31, 2017, staff memo to the FOMC titled “Preliminary Assessment of Effects of
Hurricane Harvey on the U.S. Economy.”
3 Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, it appears that many facilities remain
offline and others are only slowly returning to normal operations. These lingering effects of the hurricane
are expected to be a drag on the growth rate of industrial production in September.

Note: These estimates come from state-level indexes of retail sales spending constructed
using First Data electronic transaction data. The Hurricane Harvey estimates use Texas
retail spending, which constitutes 8 percent of national retail spending. The Hurricane
Sandy estimates use data from New York and New Jersey, which together compose
10 percent of national retail spending. These data are received with a 3-day lag.
4 These daily, geographically detailed spending series from credit and debit transactions are the
outcome of our collaboration with Palantir Technologies and First Data Corporation as part of our effort to
expand the range of economic indicators we rely on to measure economic activity and price inflation.
5 This estimate also reflects a drag from higher gasoline prices, a relatively modest effect on
monthly new light vehicle sales, and a small assumed offset from government transfers to households for
disaster relief.

 We anticipate an increase in federal government outlays for hurricane
relief of about $70 billion over the medium term, mostly in the form of
transfer payments to individuals and businesses affected by the storm
(including flood insurance payments).
 Disruptions at refineries are putting upward pressure on gasoline prices,
and we expect national gasoline prices to average $2.72 per gallon in
September on a seasonally adjusted basis, an increase of $0.45 per gallon
since August. Prices are expected to remain elevated but edge lower in
October and then return to pre-hurricane levels by November. This boost
in gasoline prices contributes about 0.4 percentage point to the 12-month
change in total PCE prices in September and October. We also nudged up
core inflation by a couple of basis points in September to reflect a
temporary effect of the hurricane on non-energy prices (such as airfares,
housing services, and motor vehicles).
 Both exports and imports through Texas ports have been disrupted by
Hurricane Harvey. However, our baseline estimate is that the contribution
of net exports to GDP growth will be mostly unaffected as international
trade flows will be rerouted to other U.S. ports. Petroleum exports may be
harder to reroute given Texas’s major role in producing and exporting
these goods. However, because these exports are less than 5 percent of
U.S. exports of goods and services, even if petroleum exports were to
temporarily decline, the effect on the net export contribution would
be modest.
6 These reductions in the value of capital stocks will probably have small implications for our
estimates of capital services, potential output, and productivity.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Fiscal Policy
 Considerable uncertainty remains about the potential size, timing, and
composition of federal fiscal policy changes that may be enacted during the
forecast period. That said, we have retained our placeholder assumption that
adjustments to federal fiscal policy will increase the primary budget deficit
(that is, the deficit excluding interest costs) by ½ percent of GDP, and that this
fiscal expansion will take the form of a cut in personal income taxes that starts
in the first quarter of 2018 and then will begin to phase out after five
years. This fiscal expansion is expected to boost the level of real GDP about
¼ percent by the end of 2020, exclusive of multiplier effects and any offsets
from higher interest rates and a stronger dollar.
 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government
(including the small effects of the assumed hurricane relief outlays) will have
a roughly neutral effect on real GDP growth in 2017 but will boost output
growth about ¼ percentage point per year in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
 The federal government continues to face multiple fiscal deadlines, though the
horizon now appears to have been pushed back to December. The most
notable items requiring action are the federal debt limit—we estimate the
Treasury will exhaust its extraordinary measures in the first week of
October—and appropriations for the fiscal year beginning October 1.8 We
7 The survey reference week for payroll employment in August was before Hurricane Harvey hit.
8 A lapse of appropriations that results in a short-term shutdown of the federal government would
have only minor implications for the outlook. For example, the staff estimates that the 16-day shutdown in
October 2013 reduced measured real GDP growth by ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that year

disruptions to government operations or financial markets. Indeed, on
&&
ee ll September 8, the Congress passed legislation that funds the government and

mm
Monetary Policy
oo
DD
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection
calls for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than 1 percentage point
per year, on average, over the projection period and to average 3.9 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2020. This path is a bit steeper than in the July Tealbook,
reflecting the slightly tighter economy we are projecting.
 The SOMA portfolio is assumed to begin a gradual and predictable decline in
the fourth quarter as reinvestments from principal repayments on securities
held in the portfolio are phased out.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise over the medium term from an
average of 2.3 percent in the current quarter to 3.5 percent by the end of 2020;
by the end of 2019, the level of the 10-year yield is a touch higher than our
July projection.
 The path of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is also little revised. However,
we lowered our projection for the triple-B corporate bond spread slightly in
the near term in response to the persistently lower-than-projected spread
observed over the past several months.
and boosted it by an equal amount in the following quarter. This calculation embodies our judgment that
there were no material effects on private investment or consumption due to reduced confidence or increased
uncertainty. In contrast, the consequences of a failure to lift the debt ceiling are not well understood and
could potentially be large. (See the box “Debt Ceiling” in the Financial Markets section.)
9 Under the Senate bill, the Treasury Department would be able to implement extraordinary
measures; therefore, the next debt limit exhaustion date would not occur until sometime in early 2018.

Equity Prices and Home Prices t l
u
O
 The change in equity prices since the July Tealbook has been close to our &
l
expectation. As before, we see notable valuation pressures as limiting the e
v
e
scope for further stock price appreciation over the medium term. D
n
o
Accordingly, equity prices are projected to rise at an average annual rate of c
E
only ½ percent from here forward, about the same as in the July Tealbook. c
ti
s
e
m
 Incoming data on house prices have been mostly in line with our expectations, o
D
and we have kept our forecast for house price appreciation this year around
6 percent. We judge that the ratio of house prices to rents is marginally above
its long-run trend. We project the growth in home values to slow to about
4 percent per year over the medium term, a pace that would stabilize the ratio
of house prices to rents.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign real GDP growth picked up to an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the
second quarter, ½ percentage point faster than estimated in the July Tealbook.
This revision largely reflects stronger-than-expected growth in Canada, along
with a gentler slowdown than we estimated in Mexico, and we expect foreign
growth to moderate to 2¾ percent in the second half of this year, a bit stronger
than forecast in July Tealbook. Foreign growth is then projected to settle at
just above 2½ percent for the remainder of the forecast period, supported in
part by accommodative monetary policies.
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 3 percent since the time of the
July Tealbook, bringing the cumulative depreciation since the December 2016
Tealbook to almost 7½ percent. For the rest of the forecast period, we expect
the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of 1¾ percent, as market
expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast.
Relative to the July Tealbook, the path of the broad real dollar starts about
3 percent lower, with the rate of appreciation little revised.
Oil Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil closed on September 6 at $54 per barrel, up
about $6 per barrel since the time of the July Tealbook. Oil prices were
boosted by several factors including a weaker dollar, greater optimism about

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP o
D
We now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the second
quarter, a noticeable step-up from the modest pace of growth in the first quarter.
Available indicators point to continued, solid GDP growth in the second half of the year,
although, as discussed earlier, Hurricane Harvey will likely affect the quarterly pattern of
growth.11 For the year as a whole, we now expect real GDP growth of 2½ percent, up
¼ percentage point from the July Tealbook and 1 percentage point above our estimate of
potential output growth.
 Real PCE increased 3½ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, a solid
bounceback, as we had expected, from a tepid first quarter. The pace of
spending on most consumer goods remained firm through July.12 However,
motor vehicle sales fell unexpectedly by ¾ million units in August. Although
we attribute only a small portion of this decline to the hurricane, we think the
weakness in August will prove transitory. More broadly, we are projecting
real PCE to increase 2¾ percent in the second half, on average, supported by
ongoing gains in income and wealth as well as by upbeat consumer sentiment.
In its annual revision in July, the BEA substantially marked down its estimate
of wage and salary income last year with only minor revisions to consumer
10 Hurricane Harvey has had little effect on the Brent price of oil. Reflecting reduced demand
from refineries, the spot price of the domestic benchmark WTI initially declined $2 per barrel, but the price
has returned to a level comparable to before Harvey.
11 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2017:Q3 Real GDP Growth,”
the median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System
stands at 2.5 percent. However, only the Kansas City Fed model includes an explicit hurricane effect. The
staff’s judgmental projection excluding hurricane effects is 2.8 percent.
12 The advance estimate of retail sales for August will be released on Friday, September 15. The
Census Bureau’s advance estimate (with a small sample and potential reporting delays due to the storm)
may not fully capture the hurricane’s effect.

ee
mm
the 7 percent increase in investment in equipment and intangibles that we
oo
DD
expect this year (which is somewhat stronger than in the July Tealbook) is a
striking improvement from the lack of any growth last year.
 We now expect that the sizable boost to GDP growth from nonresidential
structures investment in the first half of this year will give way to a modest
drag on output growth in the second half. A leveling off of the number of oil
rigs in operation and the fairly flat path for crude oil prices suggest that the
recovery of investment in drilling and mining structures will slow markedly
this quarter and next, even aside from any hurricane-related disruptions.
Outside of the energy sector, nonresidential construction spending is estimated
to have fallen sharply in June and July; these monthly indicators led us to
lower the near-term trajectory substantially.
 Residential investment declined at an annual rate of 6¼ percent in the second
quarter following a sizable gain in the first. Most of the available data suggest
a further decline but at a more modest pace in the second half of the year.
Overall, the weakening in residential investment this year is broadly
consistent with the rise in mortgage rates since last fall. In addition, supply
constraints also appear to be weighing on construction in some markets. (See
the box “Supply Constraints in the Single-Family Housing Market.”)
 Government purchases are expected to edge up in the second half of this year
after declining in the first half. However, the latest data on both construction
and employment in the state and local sector have been disappointing;
13 This downward revision to the level of historical measured income partially resolves what had
been puzzling weakness in the level of spending last year but had little effect on our PCE growth forecast
going forward. For more discussion, see the nonfinancial staff briefing to the Board on May 22, 2017.

As a result, overall net exports made a positive contribution of ¼ percentage

DD
point to U.S. GDP growth in the first half of this year. We now look for a
similar positive contribution in the second half. These contributions are
revised up from the July Tealbook, mainly reflecting stronger export and
weaker import data than we expected.
 Inventory investment was near zero in the first half of this year, and the step-
down from the elevated pace of late last year subtracted ¾ percentage point
from GDP growth. Smoothing through hurricane-related disruptions,
inventory investment is expected to return to more sustainable levels in the
second half, providing a modest boost to GDP growth.
 Manufacturing production rose at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first
half of this year, but we expect the gains in factory output to soften some in
the second half. Readings on new orders in the regional and national
manufacturing surveys remain upbeat, but, given elevated motor vehicle
inventories, we expect output in that sector will provide only a modest
impetus to production, on balance, through the end of the year.14
For the medium term, we project real GDP will increase 2¼ percent in 2018,
2 percent in 2019, and 1½ percent in 2020. This forecast for gradually slower growth
over the next few years is little revised from the July Tealbook and reflects the ongoing
normalization of monetary policy.
14 We project that light vehicle production will fall in the third quarter largely because of problems
with model-year changeovers and retooling in July. However, with days’ supply remaining high, we
project only a moderate rebound in fourth-quarter light vehicle assemblies.

OO Supply Constraints in the Single-Family Housing Market
&&
ll
ee The pace of single-family housing construction, the blue line in figure 1, remains fairly slow by
vv
ee historical standards and appears insufficient to accommodate population growth, further economic
DD
nn expansion, and demographic changes.1 In recent years, much of the increase in home demand has
oo
cc been absorbed by declining vacancy rates (figure 2). Meanwhile, house prices—the black line in
EE
cc figure 1—and rents have been rising at a steady clip, and the market for existing homes appears
ttii
ee ss especially tight. In combination, these patterns and the evidence presented in this discussion
mm
suggest that supply conditions in the single-family housing market are tighter today than before the
oo
DD recession.
The Beige Book and other sources report claims by homebuilders that they face shortages in the
supply of construction labor; however, empirical evidence on such claims is mixed. On the one hand,
the workweek for production workers in the construction industry, shown in figure 3, is above the
levels observed during the housing boom in the mid-2000s. On the other hand, the elevated
workweek has not translated to a sustained pickup in wage growth (figure 4).

1 This discussion focuses on single-family homes to ensure consistency between data sources. Single-family
homes account for the bulk of new construction and, with their relatively high value per unit, are an even larger share
of residential investment.

Anecdotal reports have also pointed to short supplies of vacant developed lots—that is, graded OO
parcels with road and plumbing connections. The supply of such lots remains somewhat elevated in &&
ll
the aggregate, but this aggregate masks substantial geographic heterogeneity. In particular, as ee

inhibiting construction: Since the national house price trough in 2012, house prices have risen faster cc
ttii
in inelastic metropolitan areas, such as New York and San Francisco, and slower in elastic areas, such ee ss
mm
as Houston and Atlanta. These patterns suggest that limited lot availability is restraining
oo
construction activity in a subset of areas. DD
Supply conditions vary within metropolitan areas as well. Over the period from 2000 to 2015, Census
tracts between 2 and 10 miles from the city center—neighborhoods that are, for the most part,
already built out—saw faster price growth but smaller net increases in the number of single-family
homes than tracts beyond 10 miles (figure 6).3 This pattern is suggestive of more-restrictive supply
in the 2-to 10-mile band. These close-in neighborhoods face potentially binding regulatory
constraints: With existing lots already built out, restrictive zoning laws commonly prevent the
subdivision of large lots into townhouse or other dense development. Tracts beyond 10 miles, by
contrast, are more likely to include vacant land and thus have lower development costs. At the
fringes of cities, regulations may include density or other restrictions but generally allow single-
family construction.
The staff’s medium-term construction and house price projections are consistent with supply
constraints restraining investment now and loosening somewhat over the projection period.
Although it is difficult to precisely quantify the effects of easing supply constraints, the staff forecast
calls for a continued strengthening in construction activity toward the pace we estimate to be
consistent with demographic requirements and for a deceleration in house price growth.

2 The elasticity estimates come from Albert Saiz (2010), “The Geographic Determinants of Housing Supply,”
Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 125 (3), pp. 1253–96. Saiz estimates city supply elasticities as functions of
geographic features (for example, coastlines and mountains) and regulation (for instance, zoning laws). From 2000
to 2015, the 11 inelastic metropolitan areas accounted for 22 percent of total net unit growth.
3 Tracts within two miles are excluded; they are difficult to compare because of an abundance of multifamily
housing, a different regulatory environment, and growing demand for urban amenities (see Victor Couture and Jessie
Handbury (2017), “Urban Revival in America, 2000 to 2010,” working paper, University of Pennsylvania, July).

DD
by 2 percent, nearly unrevised from the July Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
On balance, the two employment reports received since the July Tealbook
indicate that labor market conditions continued to improve largely as we expected.
 Private payroll gains are estimated to have averaged 191,000 per month over
the past three months, about 15,000 more per month than in the July Tealbook
projection. However, government employment edged down, on average, over
the same period and is now somewhat weaker than in the July Tealbook,
mainly reflecting softer estimates for the state and local education sector.15
Since the start of the year, the monthly increase in total nonfarm payrolls has
averaged 176,000, 11,000 lower than the average gain over the whole of 2016,
because of flat government employment.
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in August, a
touch higher than expected. The unemployment rate has been about flat since
April, but it is still 0.3 percentage point below the level at the end of last year.
The labor force participation rate came in at 62.9 percent in August,
0.2 percentage point higher than expected, and has been close to this level
since the beginning of the year. As a result, the employment-to-population
ratio, at 60.1 percent in August, was one-tenth higher than expected and up
0.2 percentage point since the beginning of the year.
 In the remaining months of the year, we expect the gains in total payroll
employment to average about 190,000 per month, about 20,000 more than in
15 We have taken only a small signal from these disappointing data for our forecast, as government
payrolls—and, in particular, education payrolls—tend to be volatile around this time of the year.

the July Tealbook. We expect job gains in September to be held down about tt ll

50,000 by the aftereffects of Hurricane Harvey but anticipate that this shortfall
&&
will be made up by November. We continue to project that the unemployment ee ll
vv
ee
rate will average 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, while the participation rate DD
nn
is now expected to edge down only to 62.8 percent, 0.1 percentage point oo
cc
EE
higher than in our previous projection. cc
ttii
ss
ee
mm
In response to the ongoing strength in labor force participation, we made a small
oo
DD
upward revision to our estimate of the trend labor force participation rate, raising its level
0.1 percentage point at the end of this year and 0.2 percentage point by the end of 2020.
We also revised down the natural rate of unemployment to 4.8 percent. Higher trend
participation and the lower natural rate of unemployment led to a small upward
adjustment in the level of potential output.
 Although the unemployment rate in August was a little (15 basis points)
higher than we had expected at the time of the July Tealbook, taking a longer
perspective, the rate has come down by more than we would have predicted
6 or 12 months ago, given our usual Okun’s law relationship. Moreover,
inflation has been surprisingly low recently, and wage growth has remained
modest. Accordingly, we nudged down our estimate of the natural rate
another tenth, to 4.8 percent at the end of last year, and carried this revision
through to the end of the medium-term projection.
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed, the outlook for the
labor market is similar to our July Tealbook projection.
 After having decreased about 1¼ percentage points since early 2015, the
unemployment rate is projected to decline another ¾ percentage point over the
next two years, reaching a low of 3.7 percent in 2019 and where it remains in
2020, 0.2 percentage point below the previous Tealbook. One-tenth of the
revision to the unemployment rate reflects the downward adjustment to the
natural rate; the other tenth reflects tighter labor market conditions.
 Total payroll gains are expected to slow from an average monthly increase of
about 180,000 this year and next to about 120,000 in 2019 and 110,000
in 2020.

though a little higher than its average over the preceding several years.16
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The 12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.4 percent in July, and we expect it
to edge up only to 1.5 percent by year-end. Taking account of hurricane-related effects
on gasoline prices, we expect the 12-month change in total PCE prices to move up to
1.9 percent in September before moving back down to 1.5 percent by the end of the year.
 Core consumer prices edged up in July, slightly less than we had expected.17
We continue to view the negative surprises this year as largely transitory,
driven by idiosyncratic movements in a few specific categories, and we
project that core price inflation will pick up modestly in the second half. In
response to the larger projected increases in import price inflation over the
remainder of the year, we slightly revised up our core PCE price projection for
the second half of this year. We continue to think that a small amount of
residual seasonality will restrain the inflation readings in the second half.18
 PCE energy prices dropped in the second quarter following sizable increases
in the previous two quarters. Smoothing through the fluctuations associated
with the hurricane, we expect consumer energy prices to move up modestly in
the second half of this year.
16 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly because a larger share of workers hired in a tight labor market have below-average
productivity than is the case during a slack labor market.
17 The August CPI will be released on Thursday, September 14.
18 Our current estimate (based on average effects over the past 10 years) is that residual seasonality
in prices adds roughly 0.1 percentage point at an annual rate to core PCE price inflation in the first half of
the year and subtracts a comparable amount in the second half.

 Core import price inflation is expected to step up from a 2½ percent pace in nn

the second quarter to 4 percent by the fourth quarter, reflecting recent dollar EE

depreciation and higher commodity prices. Import price inflation then slows ss
ee
mm
to a ¾ percent pace by late 2018, consistent with moderate foreign inflation, a
oo
DD
gradually appreciating dollar, and slowly declining commodity prices.
The latest readings on longer-term inflation expectations accord with our view
that these expectations remain reasonably stable.
 In the final August report from the University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers, the median inflation expectation over the next 5 to 10 years was
2.5 percent, near the midpoint seen over the past couple of years but lower
than the readings before then.
 The August reading on median three-year-ahead expected inflation from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was
2½ percent, at the low end of the range of values observed this year.
 The median projection for 10-year average PCE price inflation from the
Survey of Professional Forecasters (a reading taken in August) ticked back
down to 2.0 percent in the third quarter.
 The TIPS-based measure of five-year-forward inflation compensation
currently stands at 1¾ percent, little changed from its value at the time of the
July Tealbook.
Beyond the near term, our outlook for inflation is unrevised. We continue to
project that both headline and core PCE price inflation will move up to 1.9 percent next
year and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020, as the transitory factors pushing down inflation this
year abate and resource utilization continues to tighten.19
19 We have maintained for now our assumption that trend inflation rises gradually from 1.8 percent
in recent years to 1.9 percent in 2019 and 2020.

tt ll The information received on hourly compensation since the July Tealbook sent
uu
OO
mixed signals on underlying wage growth. The latest readings on average hourly
&&
ee ll earnings (AHE), the employment cost index, and the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker
vv
ee
DD are all broadly consistent with a gradual pickup in wage growth over the past several
nn
oo years. In contrast, compensation per hour was revised down substantially last year as a
cc
EE
cc result of the BEA’s annual revision; we suspect that last year’s compensation per hour
ttii
ss
ee reading was anomalously low. Taken together, we continue to forecast that the relatively
mm
oo tight labor market will bring about a step-up in the growth of hourly compensation to a
DD
pace of 3 percent this year and around 3½ percent over the medium term.
 The AHE of all employees in August was about as we expected in the July
Tealbook. It increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in August,
about even with the gain a year earlier, but higher than the average pace seen
before that.
 The employment cost index (ECI) rose 2¼ percent in the second quarter, in
line with our forecast in the July Tealbook. On a four-quarter basis, ECI
growth has picked up slightly in recent years.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3.3 percent
in July, below its recent highs but still well above the pace observed a few
years ago.
 Compensation per hour is now estimated to have edged down 0.1 percent
during 2016, a downward revision of 1¾ percentage points. Growth in the
first half of this year was higher than we had expected in the July Tealbook,
but even so, the four-quarter change as of the second quarter of 2017 is
1¼ percent, well below the pace of more than 3 percent in 2015.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We lowered our assumption for the natural rate of unemployment to
4.8 percent in the longer run. We continue to assume that the growth rate of
potential GDP will be 1.7 percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing

2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about 1½ percentage
points above its long-run value of 2.5 percent in 2021. It then moves back
toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Recent data from abroad have reinforced our narrative of a solid global expansion
coupled with low inflation. Foreign real GDP growth picked up further from an annual
rate of 3 percent in the first quarter to 3.3 percent in the second—well above trend and
½ percentage point higher than estimated in the July Tealbook. Stronger-than-expected
growth in Canada, along with a gentler slowdown than we estimated in Mexico,
contributed the most to the upward revision. The sustained and broad-based pickup in
foreign growth in the first half of 2017 has been supported by accommodative monetary
k
policy, especially in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), and it has been o
o
l
accompanied by a recovery in international trade. t
u
O
&
We expect that foreign growth will moderate to 2¾ percent in the second half e l
v
e
of 2017 primarily as economic activity in Canada slows to a more sustainable pace. This D
n
forecast is a bit stronger relative to the July Tealbook, as we have taken some signal from o
c
E
the better-than-expected GDP data. Thereafter, our outlook is little changed, as effects
l
’
t
n
from greater momentum are largely offset by those from the recent appreciation of many I
currencies against the dollar. All told, we project that foreign growth will settle by early
next year at a near-potential pace of just above 2½ percent.
Foreign inflation surprised us on the downside in the second quarter, and recent
data have remained somewhat weak. In the AFEs, inflation declined to a meager
0.3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from 2.3 percent in the first, largely
reflecting plunging retail energy prices. Core inflation held up better, though it also fell.
Data through August suggest that overall AFE inflation will increase to 1 percent in the
current quarter, but that is still a bit lower than forecast in July. As retail energy prices
stabilize and resource slack diminishes, we continue to project that inflation will rise
toward the central banks’ 2 percent targets in most AFEs. In the emerging market
economies (EMEs), inflation came in at 3.2 percent in the second quarter, about as
expected. We project that EME inflation will decline to 2½ percent in the current
quarter, depressed by widespread declines in food prices, before settling at near 3 percent
later in the forecast period.
We continue to anticipate that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative
in most AFEs. In the euro area, given the recent appreciation of the euro and the
acknowledgment that the Governing Council only just, at its September meeting, began
Page 41 of 132

--- Page 45 ---

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) September 8, 2017
discussing tapering its asset purchases, we now assume that the European Central Bank
(ECB) will normalize its policy stance a bit more gradually than assumed in the July
Tealbook. We also see the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Bank of England (BOE) keeping
their policies on hold a little longer than foreseen in July. In Canada, in contrast, in
response to the better-than-expected GDP data, the Bank of Canada (BOC) raised its
policy rate in September, and we expect the BOC to tighten its policy more rapidly than
previously anticipated. In the EMEs, several central banks have continued to ease policy,
given the relatively low incoming inflation data, including in Brazil, Colombia, India, and
Indonesia, while the Bank of Mexico (BOM) stopped its tightening in June.
k Although our forecast calls for foreign inflation to gradually pick up, we cannot
o
o rule out the possibility that it will remain low despite strong growth, especially in the
l
t
u
O AFEs, prompting a slower normalization of AFE monetary policy and an appreciation of
&
l the dollar. This risk is explored in the alternative scenario “Stronger Foreign Growth and
e
v
e Lower Inflation in the AFEs” in the Risks and Uncertainty section. In addition, whereas
D
n financial markets have been fairly quiescent thus far in 2017 and many threats from
o
c
E abroad appear less pronounced than over the past several years, important risks remain.
l
’
t
n In particular, we continue to be concerned that the expansion of credit needed to support
I
China’s strong growth may be further fueling financial imbalances. As such, we also
feature a “China-Driven EME Turbulence with Financial Spillovers” alternative scenario
in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Canada. Real GDP growth strengthened further in the second quarter, to 4.5 percent,
from an already robust pace of 3.7 percent in the first quarter. Household
consumption remained the key driver of growth, whereas residential investment
contracted, in part because of measures taken over the past year that were aimed at
slowing the rapid increases in house prices. With GDP growth surprising on the
upside—almost 2 percentage points higher than we had written down in July—and
monthly indicators remaining strong, we see greater momentum in the economy;
accordingly, we have revised up our growth projection in the second half of this year
½ percentage point to 2½ percent. We still see growth slowing to about 1¾ percent
(near potential) by early next year and staying at about that rate over the remainder of
the forecast period.

Quarterly inflation slowed more sharply than expected in the second quarter, to about
zero, as retail energy prices declined more markedly than anticipated and core
inflation came in surprisingly weak. However, inflation showed some life in the July
data, and we expect a rebound to about 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the second half
and to 2 percent over the remainder of the forecast period. Citing the stronger GDP
data, the BOC unexpectedly raised its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points to
1 percent in September, marking its second straight meeting with a rate hike. With
economic slack rapidly diminishing and inflation expected to rise, we now assume the
BOC will tighten its policy further in each of the next three quarters, taking the
overnight rate to 1.75 percent by mid-2018. We expect the policy rate to reach
2.75 percent by end-2020; this path is ½ percentage point higher, on average, over the k
o
o
forecast period relative to the July Tealbook. t l
u
O
&
• Japan. The pace of activity picked up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter to
l
e
v
2.5 percent in the second, well above the estimated trend pace of ½ percent. The e
D
positive tone of incoming data, including July’s rebound in exports, led us to revise n
o
c
up growth a bit this quarter and next. Thereafter, we see growth moderating to E
l
’
t
1 percent in 2018 before stalling in 2019 because of a legislated tax hike. n
I
Inflation has continued to disappoint—with both overall and core inflation remaining
negative in the second quarter—despite the relatively strong growth and a tight labor
market. Accordingly, we now forecast that inflation will edge up to only ¼ percent in
the current quarter and rise to slightly above 1 percent by 2020, thus remaining well
below the BOJ’s 2 percent target. Against this background, we anticipate that the
BOJ will keep the current settings of its “yield curve control” policy in place a bit
longer than previously assumed, holding the deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent
through 2020 and targeting a rate around 0 percent for the 10-year Japanese
government bond yield through the end of 2018.
• Euro Area. Real GDP growth rose from 2.2 percent in the first quarter to 2.6 percent
in the second, its fastest pace in more than two years. Indicators through August,
such as PMIs and surveys of economic sentiment, suggest that activity in the current
quarter will continue to expand at a solid pace, supported by highly accommodative
monetary policy. Growth should then settle near 1¾ percent, a bit above potential, by
mid-2018. The outlook for 2018 and 2019 is down slightly from the July Tealbook,
reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro.

Quarterly inflation fell to almost zero in the second quarter as the result of a sharp
decline in retail energy prices. Data through August suggest that retail energy prices
have continued to decline, though at a slower pace. On a 12-month basis, however,
the numbers were more encouraging, with headline inflation at 1.5 percent in August;
core inflation was 1.3 percent, well up from the average pace of 0.8 percent over
the 2014–16 period. We forecast that headline inflation will remain near 1½ percent
in 2018 but edge up to 1¾ percent by 2020. Compared with the July Tealbook, this
projection is down a touch because of the stronger euro.
Given the subdued inflation outlook and the concerns ECB officials have expressed
k about euro appreciation, we expect that monetary policy will be a bit more
o
o
t l accommodative than we assumed in the July Tealbook. At the press conference
u
O
following the ECB’s September meeting, President Draghi acknowledged that the
&
e l Governing Council started discussing the future trajectory of the asset purchase
v
e
D program and signaled that a decision could be reached in October; however, as this
n
o discussion comes after several meetings in which the withdrawal of stimulus was not
c
E
l debated, it appears there is a lack of strong consensus on the way forward.
’
t
n
I Accordingly, we now assume that the ECB will keep purchasing assets a bit longer
than previously anticipated. Amid considerable uncertainty as to exactly how its
policy will evolve, we assume that the ECB will step down its monthly purchases
from €60 billion to €30 billion in January and maintain this pace until mid-2018,
before tapering them to zero over the third quarter. We also delayed the first rate hike
one quarter to early 2019.
• United Kingdom. Economic activity has picked up a bit, with real GDP growth of
1.2 percent in the second quarter relative to 0.9 percent in the first. The main driver
of growth was government spending, while private consumption slowed sharply.
Incoming data on retail sales and PMIs suggest that growth will rise to only
1½ percent this quarter, ¼ percentage point lower than forecast in the July Tealbook.
Going forward, growth should settle around a near-potential pace of 1¾ percent, as
we expect the drag on spending exerted by Brexit-related uncertainties to be offset by
continued accommodative monetary policy.
Inflation, which had been boosted by the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate, fell
from 3.9 percent in the first quarter to 3 percent in the second, and we forecast a
further decline to 2 percent in the third, mainly due to falling retail energy prices. We
expect headline inflation to rise a bit at the end of this year as energy inflation

rebounds and the sterling depreciation continues to pass through, but then to
gradually edge down to the BOE’s 2 percent target. Even so, given recent
disappointing data on activity, sluggish wage growth, and uncertainties surrounding
Brexit and its effects on the economy, we anticipate that the BOE will remain quite
accommodative, and we have moved the timing of the first policy rate increase to the
third quarter of 2018, a quarter later than assumed in the July Tealbook. The policy
rate rises only to 1¼ percent by the end of the forecast period.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth moderated a touch to
k
o
6½ percent in the third quarter from 6.8 percent in the second. Industrial production o
l
t
contracted in July after a very strong expansion in June. Other indicators, such as u
O
PMIs and retail sales, were solid, and investment has held up better than expected in &
l
e
the face of the authorities’ modest credit tightening since late last year. With the v
e
D
generally strong tone of data in recent quarters, we now expect economic activity to n
o
slow somewhat more gradually over the forecast period than we did in the July c
E
l
’
Tealbook, to 6¼ percent by the fourth quarter and to 5¾ percent by 2020. Inflation t
n
I
has remained subdued this year, albeit buffeted by swings in food prices, and we
expect it to average 2½ percent going forward.
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth fell to 3.4 percent in the second quarter
from an unusually strong 4.3 percent pace in the first. This slowdown resulted
primarily from Korea and Taiwan, where exports took a breather, and India, where
the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) appears to have disrupted
activity. We expect exports in the region to rebound in the third quarter as anticipated
new product launches boost demand for the region’s high-tech products. Incoming
indicators, however, suggest that this rebound may be less pronounced than
previously expected. In addition, while we anticipate a bounceback in Indian growth,
we expect the GST implementation to continue to weigh on growth in the third
quarter. All told, we see growth edging up to 3¾ percent in the second half of the
year and remaining at about that pace throughout the forecast period. Relative to the
July Tealbook, our forecast is down slightly in the current quarter but is up a touch
over the rest of the forecast period, in line with the small upward revision to
Chinese growth.

• Mexico. Real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from 2.7 percent in
the first but ¾ percentage point above our July Tealbook estimate. Demand-side
components of GDP have not been released yet, but monthly indicators suggest that
household demand held up better than we expected, while investment remained weak
amid tight fiscal and monetary policies. We expect the tight policy stance to continue
to weigh on growth in the second half of the year but then see growth moving
gradually up to 3 percent by the end of the forecast period, supported by diminishing
fiscal drag, some monetary easing, and past reforms in the energy sector. A powerful
earthquake struck off the coast of southern Mexico as the Tealbook was going to
press. Although early indications suggest that the damage is limited, the situation is
k still evolving.
o
o
l
t
u
O With the fading effects of January’s fuel price hikes, headline inflation eased from
&
9.9 percent in the first quarter to 6.9 percent in the second, a still-high figure that
l
e
v
e reflected a sharp rise in food prices. Data through August suggest that, although food
D
n inflation remains elevated, core inflation is falling. We continue to see inflation
o
c
E moving back down, almost reaching the BOM’s 3 percent inflation target by early
l
’
t
n next year. The BOM kept its policy rate unchanged at its August meeting, and with
I
inflation projected to move down further, we anticipate some easing in 2018
and 2019.
• Brazil. Economic growth slipped from 4.2 percent in the first quarter to 1 percent in
the second, a step-down we largely expected, given that the first-quarter surge was
driven by a temporary spike in agricultural exports. Even so, household spending
increased in the second quarter, and recent indicators, including industrial production
for July, have been relatively upbeat. Accordingly, we project that growth will
increase slightly to 1½ percent in the current quarter. However, with monetary and
fiscal policies still tight, and political uncertainty weighing on investment, we
continue to see growth rising only to a modest 2 percent by 2018 and 2¼ percent
thereafter, despite Brazil’s emergence from the deepest recession in its history.
Twelve-month inflation fell to 2.5 percent in August, its lowest level in 18 years and
below the lower end of the central bank’s target range. Citing low inflation and a
gradual recovery, the central bank has cut its policy rate twice since the July
Tealbook, by a cumulative 200 basis points to 8.25 percent. We now expect the rate
to fall to 7 percent by early 2018.

• Venezuela. The political and economic crisis has substantially deteriorated.
Although official data on GDP and inflation have not been released since 2015,
economic activity is collapsing and inflation is estimated to be approaching
800 percent per year. Amid rising social unrest, on July 30, the country held a highly
controversial election for a new assembly to rewrite the constitution, effectively
empowering the government to dissolve the opposition-controlled congress.
Subsequently, the U.S. government imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, prohibiting
U.S. businesses from buying new debt issued by the Venezuelan government or
government-controlled entities, such as the state oil firm PDVSA.

Financial Market Developments
Over the intermeeting period, longer-dated nominal Treasury yields moved lower
on the heels of intensifying geopolitical risks and waning expectations for pro-growth
U.S. fiscal policies but were little affected on balance by mixed economic data. At the
same time, the continued weak incoming inflation data appeared to weigh on
expectations for monetary policy. Corporate bond spreads widened moderately while
broad equity price indexes were little changed on net over the period, even as Hurricane
Harvey and anticipation of Hurricane Irma’s landfall pushed down share prices in the
insurance industry. Rates for Treasury bills maturing just ahead of the mid-October debt
ceiling deadline initially rose during the intermeeting period but dropped back after
reports that the Congress would pass a short-term debt limit extension. Other short-term
funding markets exhibited no material effects.
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probabilities of a rate
increase at the September and the November meetings are close to zero, while
the probability of a rate hike occurring in December has declined to about
25 percent, although the true probability may well be higher due to the
presence of negative term premiums. FOMC communications reinforced
investors’ expectations that balance sheet normalization plans will be
s
announced at the September meeting. t

was little changed on net over the intermeeting period. Corporate bond yield
spreads widened modestly.

communications. Emerging market indexes generally climbed.
 The broad dollar index depreciated about 2¼ percent.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
Over the intermeeting period, FOMC communications were apparently
interpreted as indicating a somewhat slower-than-expected pace of policy rate increases.
Market participants were attentive to the Committee’s assessment of recent below-
expectations CPI data and the acknowledgment in the July FOMC minutes that inflation
might continue to run below 2 percent for longer than expected. A straight read of
federal funds futures rates suggests that market participants now place essentially zero
odds on the next rate hike occurring at either the September or the November meeting.
The odds of a rate hike at or before the December meeting declined from around
50 percent to roughly 25 percent, though adjusting for term premiums would indicate
higher odds.1 In addition, the OIS-implied federal funds rate at year-end in 2018 and
2019 moved down 18 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, with a staff model
attributing most of the declines to decreases in expected rates.

policy agenda. While the market reportedly remained focused on the continued weak
inflation data, yields appeared to be little affected on net by the mixed bag of economic
data releases. Staff models attribute about half of the declines in longer-term Treasury
yields over the intermeeting period to declines in term premiums.
Over the intermeeting period, both the 5-year and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based
measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net. The option-adjusted
spreads of yields on the production-coupon MBS over Treasury yields moved slightly
lower. Market participants reportedly continue to expect a limited price effect from a
reduced pace of MBS purchases by the Federal Reserve following a change in the
FOMC’s reinvestment policy.
Since the July FOMC meeting, the S&P 500 index was little changed on net. The
one-month-ahead option-implied volatility of the S&P 500 index—the VIX—also
changed little on net despite brief spikes associated with shifts in geopolitical tensions
and domestic political uncertainties. Stock prices of utilities outperformed the broader
market while banks underperformed, which is typical when interest rates fall. Largely
owing to the anticipated damage from Hurricane Irma, on top of that from Hurricane
Harvey, stocks in the S&P 500 Insurance group were down about 6 percent over the
period.
Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields of investment-grade bonds over

Foreign Developments Fi
Since the July FOMC meeting, rising tensions with North Korea and increased
political uncertainty in the United States resulted, at times, in an increase in volatility in
financial markets. Risky asset prices were mixed, on balance, with equity indexes falling
in the AFEs and rising in most EMEs.
Despite better-than-expected foreign economic data, long-term yields in the AFEs
declined, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions, U.S. political uncertainty, and
foreign central bank communications. As expected, the Bank of England kept its
monetary policy stance unchanged at its meeting on August 3 but lowered its outlook for
growth, which pushed yields lower. The ECB also kept its policies unchanged at its

September 7 meeting, but communications over the period shifted expectations toward a
more gradual withdrawal of stimulus. In contrast, the Bank of Canada surprised markets
with a 25 basis point increase at its September 6 meeting. On net since the July FOMC
meeting, 10-year sovereign yields are lower by nearly 30 basis points in the United
Kingdom and Germany but are down only 8 basis points in Canada.
The dollar continued to weaken on waning expectations of pro-growth U.S. fiscal
policies and improving economic prospects abroad. Since the previous FOMC meeting,
the broad dollar index depreciated about 2¼ percent. The decline was widespread: The
dollar declined by 4 percent against the Chinese renminbi, which was boosted by strong
economic data prints and less pressure from net capital outflows. The euro appreciated
on better-than-expected data releases, and the Canadian dollar rose after the Bank of
Canada tightened policy sooner than expected. Following escalating tensions in the
Korean peninsula, the Korean won modestly depreciated, while the Japanese yen,
commonly viewed as a safe-haven currency, appreciated.
Despite generally better-than-expected earnings releases, most advanced economy
stock market indexes declined slightly, with bank stocks underperforming broader
indexes. Outside of Korea, emerging market asset prices have been largely resilient to
the recent escalation of geopolitical risks, supported by lower interest rates in the
advanced economies and higher commodity prices. Most emerging market equity
indexes climbed, with the notable exception of the Korean Kospi index, which fell s

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Following news of an agreement between the Administration and the Congress to
extend the debt ceiling by three months, rates on Treasury bills maturing in October
retraced their entire increase from early in the intermeeting period (see the box “Debt
Ceiling”). Outside of the Treasury bill market, conditions in domestic short-term funding
markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. Excluding month-ends, the
effective federal funds rate held steady at 1.16 percent, closely tracked by the overnight
Eurodollar rate. Overnight triparty Treasury repo rates remained around the low end of
the federal funds target range. Term funding rates, both secured and unsecured, also
remained roughly flat. Volumes across money markets were roughly stable. ON RRP

Debt Ceiling
On September 6, the Administration and congressional leaders announced an
agreement to extend the debt ceiling by three months.1 The U.S. Treasury had
announced earlier that it would be critical for the Congress to act by September
29; the Board staff had estimated that the Treasury could operate with the cash it
would have on hand without breaching the debt ceiling until mid‐October.
Concerns about the possibility of an October debt ceiling impasse were apparent
in Treasury yields during most of the intermeeting period. As shown by the red
line in figure 1, yields on Treasury bills maturing in October increased by as many
as 20 basis points, with one‐week‐forward bill rates (the red line in figure 2)
showing the largest increase for the first week in October. Yields on Treasury
coupon securities maturing around early October appeared to increase for some
time as well.2 These increases were generally consistent with moves seen in
previous debt limit episodes, though the rise in bill yields began much earlier than
in previous episodes. Immediately following reports on September 6 of the
forthcoming agreement, however, yields on bills maturing in early October
retraced much of these moves (the black line in figure 2).

During the 2011 and 2013 debt ceiling impasses, money market funds (MMFs)
experienced sizable net redemptions and made significant portfolio shifts. No
evidence of serious concerns emerged among MMFs during the intermeeting
period, although anecdotal reports indicated that some funds were avoiding
Treasury securities maturing in October, and MMFs remain vulnerable to
potential debt ceiling risks. Following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s s
t
e
MMF reforms, the government MMF sector today is much larger, with k
r
substantially greater holdings of Treasury securities than two years ago. As such, a
M
MMF redemptions and portfolio shifts could be sizable if a debt ceiling impasse
l
a
extends close to an anticipated breach date. Moreover, “flight to quality” shifts ci
n
in MMF portfolios could result in greater MMF usage of the Federal Reserve ON a
n
RRP facility than in past debt ceiling episodes, which would drain cash from the Fi
market.

take-up over the intermeeting period averaged $120 billion, lower than the previous
intermeeting period, which included the usual high MMF participation leading to quarter-
end.2
As the Treasury maneuvered to remain below the debt ceiling, its account balance
at the Federal Reserve declined to about $50 billion, below its stated policy target of
precautionary balances to cover an average week of gross outlays. The decline
corresponded with an increase in reserve balances, which was primarily absorbed by
branches and agencies of foreign banks.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households continued to be
accommodative and supportive of growth in spending and investment in recent months.
The only markets in which terms and standards appeared to have tightened are subprime
auto loans and subprime credit cards. Nonetheless, even in these markets conditions
overall appeared to be accommodative for subprime auto loans and only somewhat tight
for subprime credit cards. Most indicators of credit quality for businesses and households
were consistent with strong loan and corporate bond performance, although delinquency
rates continued to tick up for subprime auto and credit card loans.
• Gross issuance was robust for both corporate bonds and equities in July and
August. Institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed in July, probably
because of seasonal factors, after a strong pace of issuance in the first half of
the year.
• Bank lending to nonfinancial firms stayed relatively subdued in July and
August. Although commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth ticked up
from its pace in the first half of the year, it remained much weaker than earlier
in the economic recovery.
• Household debt continued to increase at a moderate pace in the second
quarter, albeit at a slightly slower pace than disposable income.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
Over the intermeeting period, financing conditions for large nonfinancial firms
remained accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate bonds increased in August over
its robust pace in July, and companies reportedly continued to earmark most of the
proceeds of issuance for refinancing existing debt. Institutional leveraged loan issuance s
n
o
in June continued its robust pace, although it slowed notably in July as it entered the ti
di
typically quiet summer season. Gross equity issuance was solid in July and August, n
o
C
mostly reflecting the pace of seasoned equity offerings.

C&I loan growth over July and August ticked up but remained weak. Responses
to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)
suggest that lackluster demand was a key factor in this weakness earlier this summer, and
more recent reports indicate that loan demand has remained weak, especially at
large banks.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained favorable over the
intermeeting period. The volume of corporate bond upgrades exceeded that of
downgrades in both July and August, and the trailing bond default rate in July remained
near its lowest level since 2014. Meanwhile, the expected year-ahead default rate stayed
near the midpoint of its historical range in August.
The corporate earnings reporting season for the second quarter drew to a close
over the intermeeting period. Aggregate earnings for S&P 500 firms increased
1.3 percent from their levels in the first quarter (seasonally adjusted) and 10 percent over
their year-ago levels. The outlook for corporate earnings remained favorable through
mid-August, as the strong projections by Wall Street analysts for year-ahead earnings for
S&P 500 companies were essentially unrevised relative to the previous month.
Small Businesses
Overall, credit market conditions for small businesses have remained fairly stable,
with small business lending activity staying relatively flat in recent months. The most
recent Wells Fargo Small Business Index survey and the SLOOS continued to suggest
that the growth in small business lending activity is limited by weak demand for credit
rather than by tight credit standards. Delinquency rates on existing debt remained just
above record lows.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for CRE remained accommodative, although loan growth at
banks continued to moderate in July and August. The weakening was concentrated in
nonfarm nonresidential loans and in construction and land development loans, especially
s
n
at large banks. Meanwhile, CMBS issuance so far this year has been in line with the o
ti
same period last year. di

CMBS spreads decreased slightly since the July FOMC meeting and remained g

the crisis. However, as the staff has noted previously, these delinquencies were largely
expected by market participants and do not appear to be having any material effects on
credit availability or market conditions.1 Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages
held by other financial institutions continued to drift down from low levels.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets continued to be accommodative on
balance. Gross issuance of municipal bonds remained solid in August. Yields on 20-year
municipal bonds were little changed, and their ratios over comparable-maturity Treasury
yields increased a touch relative to the July FOMC meeting. The credit quality of state
and local governments improved in recent months, as the number of credit rating
upgrades notably outpaced the number of downgrades. While CDS spreads on Illinois
bonds have been falling since the state’s budget was approved in early July, they
remained very elevated.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative
for most borrowers over the intermeeting period. Mortgage rates decreased in line with
longer-term Treasury and MBS yields. The rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now
stands at about 3.9 percent, 20 basis points lower than at the July FOMC meeting.
Overall, historically low mortgage rates and accommodative mortgage credit availability
have supported a continued increase in mortgage originations for home purchases.
However, credit conditions remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or with
hard-to-document incomes.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative,
although lending standards and terms have tightened somewhat for auto and credit card
loans, particularly in the subprime segments of these categories. The tightening is likely s

originations to subprime borrowers declined so far this year, and the average credit
score of borrowers who took out auto loans in the second quarter remained close to the
upper end of the range seen in recent years. Even so, auto loan credit appeared to be
available to most subprime borrowers, while standards for subprime credit cards were
somewhat tight.
That said, overall consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace
through the second quarter, with credit card, auto, and student loans all posting growth
rates of around 6 percent on a year-over-year basis in June. More-recent data indicate
that growth in credit card balances at banks picked up somewhat further this summer.
(The box “Recent Trends in Credit Borrowing and Convenience Use” places the growth
in credit card balances in a larger context.) The ABS market continued to provide steady
support for consumer lending. In particular, year-to-date issuance of consumer ABS
remained robust and outpaced that of the previous year amid tighter yield spreads and
favorable market conditions.

Recent Trends in Credit Card Borrowing and Convenience Use
Outstanding balances on credit cards have risen 5½ percent at an annual rate for the past
three years, raising concerns that some households are becoming overextended. Unlike
other types of household borrowing, however, not all increases in credit card balances
represent higher household indebtedness. Aggregate credit card balances can rise when
households use credit cards to pay for a larger share of their purchases even if such a
shift in use generates additional “convenience balances” that are paid in full each month.
This discussion introduces a new measure of the share of outstanding credit card
balances that represents actual borrowing as opposed to convenience balances. The
measure uses data collected from the Quarterly Report of Credit Card Plans. As shown by
the black line in figure 1, this “borrowing share” of outstanding credit card balances
hovered above 80 percent before the financial crisis. It then stepped up to more than
90 percent in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, likely reflecting card holders
tapping credit cards to meet spending needs during this period of financial stress. Since
early 2011 the share has been trending down, reaching about 77 percent in early 2017.
Accordingly, although both convenience balances (the orange area in figure 1) and total
balances have expanded to historical highs, balances associated with actual borrowing
(the yellow area in figure 1) remain a bit below the pre‐crisis peak level. The subdued
increase in actual borrowing may reflect two factors. First, tight lending standards since
the financial crisis made credit cards less available for borrowers with subprime credit
histories. Such borrowers are more likely to be budget constrained than prime
borrowers, and they are particularly likely to deploy their cards for borrowing rather than
convenience use. Second, consistent with the broad post‐crisis trend of household
deleveraging, credit card holders, in aggregate, may have become more cautious about
accumulating debt.
This trend, however, is not uniform across all lenders and households. Figure 2 shows our
borrowing share measure for a particular institution whose credit card lending is
concentrated in the subprime sector. In contrast to the aggregate measure, this measure
has been rising steadily for three years. This heavy borrowing among the subset of
subprime borrowers who are able to access credit card debt may help explain the recent
rise in delinquencies among such borrowers.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n c
U
&
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic activity as s
k
s
being in line, on balance, with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by Ri
the FOMC. Many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted as reflective of
macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued: Corporate bond spreads have largely
moved sideways recently and remain low, while the VIX has moved up some but remains
near the low end of its historical range. In addition, we continue to see less uncertainty
associated with the foreign economic outlook than through most of last year. That said, it
appears to us that considerable uncertainty remains about the future direction of several
aspects of federal fiscal policy.
We continue to judge the risks around our medium-term projections for both GDP
growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. Consistent with that view, estimates of
the distribution of risks around the staff forecasts for GDP growth and the unemployment
rate conditional on available indicators, shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying
Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly skewed. Moreover, the risks to our outlook
associated with monetary policy having to return to the effective lower bound (ELB)
remain substantially lower than they were earlier in the recovery. Based on stochastic
simulations in the FRB/US model around the current baseline forecast, we estimate that
the probability of returning to the ELB sometime over the next three years, shown in the
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” has moved down a little since the
previous Tealbook.1
With regard to inflation, we still see the current level of uncertainty around our
projection as in line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside
and upside as roughly balanced. This assessment is consistent with the estimates of the
conditional distribution of inflation forecast risks. To the downside, the recent soft
readings on inflation could prove to be more persistent than we have assumed. Also, the
Michigan survey measure of longer-run inflation expectations has drifted down since
1 These ELB risk estimates and the confidence intervals around the baseline projection were
calculated using the revised method for stochastic simulations described in the memo “A New Procedure
for Generating the Stochastic Simulations in FRB/US” distributed to Federal Reserve Bank research
directors on September 7, 2017.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first two scenarios explore
downside and upside risks to our inflation outlook. In the first scenario, a different
inflation process is assumed in which both the wage and price Phillips curves are even
flatter and inflation expectations are lower, such that inflation remains persistently below
the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. In contrast, the second scenario examines the risk that
the response of wages and, in turn, prices to a further tightening of labor market
conditions will be stronger than we have assumed. In the third scenario, we present the
implications of a negative shock to aggregate demand in an environment of lower long-
run inflation expectations. The fourth scenario illustrates the effects of a broad policy
disappointment in which consumer, business, and investor expectations deteriorate
markedly, as the anticipated fiscal expansion and reduction in regulatory burdens do not
materialize. The fifth scenario envisions that inflation in the advanced foreign economies
(AFEs) remains very low despite robust economic growth, inducing AFE central banks to
normalize policy more slowly than in the baseline. The last scenario considers the
possibility that a slowdown in China’s economy triggers financial turbulence in emerging
market economies (EMEs), with significant spillovers to advanced economies.
We simulate these scenarios using three staff models.2 (Forecast errors over
recent years from two of these models, FRB/US and EDO, are discussed in the box at the
end of this section.) In all of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the same
policy rule as in the baseline. The size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are
assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios.
2 The models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; EDO, which is an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy;
and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

c
long-run inflation expectations—features incorporated in both the judgmental forecast n
U
apparatus and the FRB/US model. However, it is possible that the process for inflation &
s
k
has changed over the past two decades in ways that are not yet embedded in the baseline s
Ri
projection for inflation. In particular, the Phillips curve may be even flatter, and thus the
projected tight economy may contribute much less—if at all—to the return of inflation to
the 2 percent objective. Furthermore, long-run inflation expectations may prove more
important for inflation dynamics than in the baseline. In this scenario, we reestimate the
price–wage block of the FRB/US model on the (admittedly rather short) post-2000
sample and indeed obtain a much flatter Phillips curve and a greater role for expectations
than in the baseline version of the model.
Under these circumstances, the flatter Phillips curve eliminates the upward
pressure to inflation from tightening labor resources in the baseline. Lower actual
inflation feeds through into lower long-run inflation expectations and—given the greater
role of these expectations in driving actual inflation—results in further downward
pressure on inflation. As a result, inflation hovers around 1½ percent until the end of
2020 before edging up to only 1¾ percent in 2022.
In response to the lower path for inflation, the federal funds rate increases less
rapidly than in the baseline. Real GDP growth is a bit faster, and the unemployment rate
falls more rapidly, bottoming out at 3½ percent in 2020 and remaining lower than in the
baseline for some time thereafter.
Steeper Phillips Curve [FRB/US]
Alternatively, as labor and product markets continue to tighten, inflation could
rise much faster than in the baseline. Some recent research suggests that the relationship
between labor utilization and wage growth, and hence price inflation in the FRB/US
model, may become stronger—the Phillips curve may steepen—as the labor market

Lower Inflation Expectations and Weaker Aggregate Demand [EDO]
The baseline projection assumes that inflation expectations are roughly consistent
with the Committee’s 2 percent objective. However, those expectations could be driven
lower—for example, by the persistent experience of inflation below 2 percent in recent
years. In addition, inflation expectations may decline if households and firms perceive
that the ELB introduces a sizable asymmetry in inflation dynamics.5 In this scenario, we
explore the implications of adverse aggregate demand developments in an environment
of low inflation expectations. In particular, expectations of inflation over the next
five years fall 25 basis points relative to the baseline. Against that background, an
adverse shock to aggregate demand pushes inflation even further below the FOMC’s
objective.
Under these circumstances, real GDP growth slows to 1½ percent in the middle of
2018 and then rebounds to 2¼ percent in 2019. The unemployment rate increases to
4½ percent at the beginning of 2018, ½ percentage point above the judgmental

times larger than in the current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of the increase reflects a
comparison between estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the
late 1990s. Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those
representing inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

In this scenario, we assume that federal policymakers fail to implement the fiscal
expansion that is incorporated in the baseline. Other policy changes that financial market
participants may have priced into current asset values, such as an easing of regulatory
burdens, also fail to materialize.6 Moreover, this scenario assumes that the staff has not
fully appreciated the positive effects on consumer and business sentiment of anticipated
fiscal and regulatory actions. Consequently, in addition to the direct, conventional
restraint on aggregate demand stemming from the fact that the fiscal expansion does not
materialize, economic activity is also curtailed by an erosion in consumer sentiment and
an increase in perceived risk by businesses and financial markets. In particular, we
assume that equity and bond risk premiums rise more quickly than in the baseline. By
mid-2018, equity prices fall about 15 percent, while the term premium on Treasury
securities rises 40 basis points. At the same time, the triple-B corporate bond spread rises
about 55 basis points above the baseline.7
Primarily reflecting the deterioration in sentiment assumed in this scenario, real
GDP growth slows to ¾ percent in 2018, roughly 1½ percentage points below the
baseline. The unemployment rate rises to its natural rate of 4.8 percent in 2019, and
inflation is a bit lower than in the baseline in the 2019–22 period. With a lower level of
resource utilization and slightly lower inflation than in the baseline, the federal funds rate
rises only very gradually after the first half of 2018, reaching 2¼ percent at the end of
2020, about 1½ percentage points below the baseline rate.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Lower Inflation in the Advanced Foreign
Economies [SIGMA]
In our baseline forecast, we expect that inflation in the AFEs will gradually edge
up to their central banks’ targets as output expands at a solid pace and labor markets
progressively tighten. This scenario considers the possibility that foreign activity in both
6 To be clear, in both the baseline and the alternative simulation, regulatory relief is assumed to
not affect the economy directly but rather indirectly through its effects on sentiment and asset values.

AFEs pushes down AFE bond yields relative to the baseline, including through effects on
term premiums, and induces an appreciation of the broad real dollar of around 2 percent.
These developments raise U.S. output, as the stimulus to net exports from higher
foreign activity more than offsets the restraining influence of a slightly stronger dollar.
In addition, because the easier monetary policy abroad reduces U.S. term premiums,
domestic demand is also higher. On net, U.S. real GDP expands 2½ percent in 2018,
about ¼ percentage point more than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate dips
below 3½ percent in 2019. Core PCE inflation runs slightly above 2 percent over most of
the forecast period, as the boost from stronger activity is only partly offset by the dollar
appreciation. The federal funds rate rises somewhat faster than in the baseline, increasing
to 4½ percent by the end of 2020.
China-Driven Emerging Market Economy Turbulence with Financial
Spillovers [SIGMA]
In our baseline forecast, we expect Chinese real GDP growth to gradually
moderate from about 7 percent in the first half of this year to a still-solid 5¾ percent pace
by the end of 2020. However, given China’s underlying vulnerabilities—including high
corporate debt and a large and opaque shadow banking system—adverse shocks could
trigger a quicker and more pronounced slowdown of Chinese GDP growth and renewed
pressures on the renminbi, with negative spillovers to other EMEs. This scenario
assumes that such a risk materializes. GDP growth in China and other EMEs falls to just
3 percent and 1 percent, respectively, in 2018, as corporate borrowing spreads increase
150 basis points and confidence declines. The stresses in EMEs also trigger a sizable rise
in borrowing spreads in the United States and in the AFEs, while flight-to-safety flows
cause the dollar to appreciate 10 percent and depress term premiums on U.S. government
bonds. Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central banks are assumed
to tighten monetary policy to mitigate the upward pressure on inflation that arises from
the depreciation of their currencies.
The appreciation of the dollar, weaker foreign activity, and adverse financial
spillovers cause U.S. GDP growth to moderate to about 1¼ percent in 2018 and the

ee This discussion reports real‐time forecast errors for the FRB/US and EDO models over the past

Tables 1 and 2 report the forecast errors of the judgmental projection and of the FRB/US and EDO

April Tealbook of the corresponding year. The tables also report the revisions to the 2017
projections since April 2016.
The FRB/US and EDO forecast errors are, on average, somewhat larger than the judgmental
forecast errors, and neither model uniformly dominates the other one in forecasting
performance. FRB/US slightly overpredicted GDP growth in 2016 as it did in 2015, while EDO
projections were very close to the observed data. Like the judgmental projection, both models
underpredicted the decline in unemployment in 2014 and 2015.2 In 2016, while the EDO model

was still surprised on the downside by unemployment, FRB/US predicted a sharper decline in the yy
tt
unemployment rate than the realized one, leading to a positive forecast error. FRB/US did well in nn

forecasting total PCE inflation from 2014 to 2016. That said, both models viewed inflation as tt

fundamentals; both models have revised down their forecast for this year significantly.

Overall, the economy in 2016 was somewhat weaker than the FRB/US model had projected, with
RRii
lower GDP growth, a higher unemployment rate, and weaker inflation. The lower‐than‐expected
GDP growth in 2016 is accounted for by softer‐than‐expected fiscal data and weaker supply‐side
conditions.3 The model largely attributed the upward surprise in the unemployment rate to
transient labor market shocks. Similarly, the model attributed the bulk of the forecast error in
core PCE inflation to “own” shocks affecting non‐energy price equations‐‐‐in other words, the
surprise could not primarily be explained by misses in other conditioning variables such as slack.
The smaller forecast error in headline PCE inflation reflects offsetting shocks to the energy‐sector
equations.
FRB/US promulgates a number of the shocks that resulted in forecast errors in 2016. For instance,
the more adverse supply conditions are persistent, which, all else being equal, translates to a
downward revision to the 2017 projection for GDP growth. However, these weaker supply‐side
factors are partially offset by the more‐accommodative‐than‐expected stance of monetary policy
since April 2016‐‐‐FRB/US expected the path for the federal funds rate to follow that prescribed by
the inertial Taylor rule, and the outcome has been flatter. Likewise, the weaker non‐energy prices
are propagated in the projection horizon, leading to a downward revision for both measures of
inflation in 2017.
Real activity in 2016 was a bit stronger than predicted by the EDO model, although, as previously
mentioned, inflation surprised to the downside. The model interpreted the positive news about
GDP growth as a transient improvement in productivity that offset softer‐than‐expected
government and foreign spending and business investment. The model attributed the lower
unemployment rate to softer‐than‐expected wages (shocks to the wage Phillips curve that made
hiring more favorable). The lower inflation is attributed not only to these negative shocks to the
wage Phillips curve, but also, given the upward surprise to GDP growth, directly to idiosyncratic
movements in the price data, as in FRB/US. In the EDO model, these idiosyncratic movements
take the form of negative shocks to the price Phillips curve.
As in the FRB/US model, monetary policy in 2016 was more accommodative than the EDO model
expected, and, as a result, the model projection for 2017 GDP growth was revised up and the
unemployment rate was revised down. The model also projected forward the negative shocks to
the wage Phillips curve—it revised down the projected path for wage growth, which contributed
to a further downward revision to the projection for unemployment and also resulted in lower
inflation.
3 Over the course of 2016, the supply‐side assumptions in the judgmental forecast were also revised,
including a reduction in the estimate of structural productivity growth.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from cc

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&&
ss
kk
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals ss
RRii
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval

median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with
those in the Tealbook baseline. The simple rules and optimal control exercises reviewed
below prescribe trajectories for the federal funds rate that are little changed or slightly
higher than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s small upward revisions to the
projected output gap. In the special exhibit “Implications of Policy Inertia in a
Recession,” we discuss a number of monetary policy strategies in a recession scenario.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), a first-difference rule, and a nominal income
(NI) targeting rule.1 These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for
the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels, and, except for
the first-difference rule, use the staff’s assumption for the longer-run real federal funds
rate of 50 basis points as the intercept term. The middle panel also provides the staff’s
baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of
the Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary adjustment to the intercept. Because this
adjustment is small, the baseline rule yields essentially the same path for the federal
funds rate as the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule without the temporary
adjustment; we therefore omit results under the latter rule.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules are slightly
higher than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revisions to the
staff’s forecasts of the output gap. The prescriptions from these rules, which
do not feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the Tealbook
baseline policy path.
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section.

• The prescriptions of the first-difference rule are a bit higher than those in the
July Tealbook, reflecting small upward revisions in the staff’s near-term
projections of core inflation and the change in the output gap.
• Under the NI targeting rule, monetary policy reacts to the gap between the
level of actual nominal GDP and a target path determined by growth in
potential output plus 2 percent inflation. The nominal income gap can be
expressed as the sum of the current output gap and the shortfall of the GDP
deflator from the level it would have attained had it increased at an annual rate
of 2 percent since a reference date. The amount of stimulus that NI targeting
delivers depends importantly on the initial deviation in nominal GDP that
policymakers seek to offset. In our implementation, the reference date is
2011:Q4, and the initial shortfall in nominal GDP is 3.5 percent. As a result,
unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, the NI targeting rule
does not call for raising the federal funds rate in the near term.
A MEDIUM-TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model given
the staff’s baseline projection. This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• At 2.32 percent, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is slightly
higher than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s small upward revisions
to the projected output gap.
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is
1½ percentage points below the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because the
policy reaction function used by the staff in constructing the baseline forecast
includes an interest rate smoothing term, reacts to both the output gap and
inflation deviations from 2 percent, and, more generally, is not designed to
close the output gap in three years.

SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and
the NI targeting rule. These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output
gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified
policy rules.2 The simulations are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers
commit to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial market
participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow
through on this commitment, but also understand the macroeconomic implications of
s

• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate, large tightening in policy. The
real federal funds rate lies above the Tealbook baseline through 2021, leading
to a higher real 10-year Treasury yield through 2019. Consistent with the
tighter financial conditions, the unemployment rate is higher than under the
Tealbook baseline through 2021.
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate tightening in policy but
prescribes lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over the period
shown because it responds less strongly to the projected rise in output above
its potential level. The real federal funds rate falls below the Tealbook
baseline for a sustained period starting in 2020. Market participants anticipate
these lower rates and, as a result, the real 10-year Treasury yield is lower than
the Tealbook baseline path over the period shown. The more accommodative
2 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.
3 Contrary to our modeling assumptions, the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC
might well entail a period during which the public learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic
implications. Large changes in policy strategy might be especially likely to be associated with drawn-out
learning periods or a misinterpretation of the Committee’s intentions by the public. We abstract from such
considerations here.

financial conditions are associated with a higher trajectory for inflation and,
eventually, a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate than under the
Tealbook baseline.
• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate for the next two years than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower
path for some years thereafter. The latter divergence occurs because the first-
difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap
rather than to its level, reacts to the narrowing of the output gap over the next
decade. The associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction
with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer-term
real rates over the entire projection period than in the Tealbook baseline and
therefore higher levels of resource utilization and inflation. Thus, the first-
difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower
than, and inflation outcomes that exceed, the corresponding outcomes in the
Tealbook baseline projection.
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the
federal funds rate than the other rules because the rule seeks to compensate for
the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as measured by the growth rate of the
GDP deflator) from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.
Because we assume that the FOMC credibly commits to closing this gap, and
that economic agents correctly anticipate the long period of low federal funds
rates, inflation is higher and nominal and real 10-year Treasury rates are lower
than under the other policy rules and the Tealbook baseline. The path for the
unemployment rate is substantially lower than for all the other simulations
shown, dropping slightly below 3¼ percent in the middle of 2020.
• The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are slightly higher than those
conditional on the July Tealbook projection, reflecting the staff’s small
upward revisions to the projected output gap.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.4
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices, which
may improve economic outcomes.5
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path. This higher path arises
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome
that policymakers judge to be costly. The tighter policy results in a path for
the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook
baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of
inflation to changes in levels of resource utilization in the FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal
4
The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix in this Tealbook section
provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
5 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from
the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). Moreover, these
promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants. Under the
alternative assumption of optimal policy under discretion, which does not rely on the credibility of
policymakers’ promises, the results differ significantly only in the simulation in which there is an
asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

weights; it is also below the Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric
loss function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered
by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment. Because
the public believes that policymakers will follow through on this policy rate
path even as the unemployment rate substantially undershoots its natural rate,
the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2 percent somewhat more quickly
than in the case of equal weights. Starting in 2026 (not shown), the
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as
policymakers seek to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the
prolonged period in which resource utilization is elevated.6
• The third simulation exercise, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a
loss function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is
five times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical to that specification. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly
more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming
years. The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an
unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds only weakly to resource
utilization. Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to raise inflation in the
near term only a modest amount—a policy strategy that is seen as costly under
this specification of the loss function.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but
that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than
under the specification with equal weights and remains near 6 percent over
much of the remainder of the period shown. This strong tightening of policy
6 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “Asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to re-optimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function.

results from an effort to prevent the projected undershooting of the natural rate
of unemployment. The paths for the real federal funds rate and the real
10-year Treasury yield are also notably higher for a couple of years than in the
case of equal weights. Because the short-run Phillips curve is quite flat in the
FRB/US model, this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to that in
the equal-weights case over the period shown, even though it keeps the
unemployment rate much closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.7
• The federal funds rate paths prescribed by optimal control under the above
loss functions are somewhat higher than in the July Tealbook over the period
s
e shown. These higher paths reflect a slightly lower unemployment rate relative
gi
t e to the natural rate in the staff’s baseline projection than in the July Tealbook.8

P
y In this special exhibit, we use the FRB/US model to examine how the degree of
r
a

e
n
o based on the alternative scenario titled “Broad Policy Disappointment with Market
M
Correction” in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook, but with larger
negative shocks than considered in that scenario.9 In our scenario, real GDP begins to
contract in the third quarter of 2018 and continues to decline for four quarters. We
display simulations of this scenario under four alternative monetary policy strategies: the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule used to construct the scenario, the (non-inertial)
Taylor (1999) rule, the Reifschneider-Williams (2000) rule (described below), and
optimal control with equal weights in the loss function. The start of the simulation period
coincides with the beginning of the recession.
7 After 2023, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes above and
sometimes below the corresponding values observed in the case of equal weights.
8 The staff lowered its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment from 4.9 percent to
4.8 percent and lowered the projected unemployment rate by a slightly larger amount.
9 As in the alternative scenario “Broad Policy Disappointment with Market Correction,” we
assume that the federal government fails to implement the fiscal expansion projected in the baseline, that
other policy changes expected by financial market participants also fail to materialize, and that economic
activity is further curtailed by an erosion in consumer sentiment as well as an increase in perceived risk by
businesses and financial markets following the policy disappointment. However, the decline in consumer
and business sentiment is larger, and the cumulative decline of equity valuations by the third quarter of
2018 is twice as large in our recession scenario compared with the alternative scenario in the Risks and
Uncertainty section.

• When policymakers follow the prescription of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule,
the federal funds rate falls only gradually because of the interest rate
smoothing term in the rule. The federal funds rate bottoms out near ½ percent
at the end of 2020 before rising gradually to just above 2 percent at the end of
the period shown. Under this strategy, the unemployment rate peaks at
6 percent in the first quarter of 2020, up nearly 1¾ percentage points from the
current level. Inflation stays below 2 percent even after the end of the
recession.10
• When policymakers follow the prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) rule, which
has no interest smoothing term, they lower the federal funds rate more
aggressively than under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, reaching the effective
lower bound in the second quarter of 2019.11 Despite this more aggressive
action, the resulting path for inflation is further below 2 percent throughout
the period shown, whereas the unemployment gap is only a little lower in the
first couple of years and higher thereafter. The reason for these differences
lies in the prescribed path of the federal funds rate over the medium term:
The non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a higher federal funds rate path
than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule starting in 2021. Because the public
anticipates the stance of monetary policy in the future, the more substantial
tightening in the medium term pushes longer-term rates up while the quicker
monetary easing at the beginning of the recession pushes longer-term rates
down. Thus, the effects of the lack of inertia in the Taylor (1999) rule on
economic activity in the near term are ambiguous.
• Our implementation of the Reifschneider-Williams (RW) rule seeks to
compensate for policymakers’ inability to lower the federal funds rate below
its effective lower bound. Under the RW rule, policymakers delay increases
in the federal funds rate during the economic recovery until they have made
up for the cumulative shortfall in policy accommodation caused by a binding
10 This persistent shortfall in inflation results from an assumption in the construction of the
scenario that inflation expectations erode during and after the recession. Inflation eventually returns to
2 percent, helped by a period of tight resource utilization beyond the period shown.
11 In this simulation, we add a downward intercept adjustment of 25 basis points to the Taylor
(1999) rule in the third quarter of 2018 only. Absent this adjustment, this rule would call for a modest
increase in the federal funds rate in the first quarter of the recession.

assumption that policymakers follow the prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.

effective lower bound.12 When policymakers follow the prescriptions of this
rule, they initially lower the federal funds rate at a pace virtually identical to
that of the Taylor (1999) rule but they then keep the federal funds rate at the
effective lower bound for two more quarters. The resulting monetary policy
stance is only very slightly more accommodative than that prescribed by the
Taylor (1999) rule because the cumulative shortfall in policy accommodation
is small. Therefore, the paths of inflation and the unemployment rate are
almost the same as those obtained under the Taylor (1999) rule.
• When policymakers follow the prescriptions of optimal control with equal
weights, they optimally take into account that macroeconomic outcomes are
affected by both current and future policy choices. In this case, the federal
funds rate drops to the effective lower bound at a pace similar to that under
the Taylor (1999) rule but then stays there until the second quarter of 2022
before rising to just under 2 percent at the end of the period shown. This
monetary policy stance is unambiguously more accommodative than those
associated with the policy rules described above. It is also worth noting that
the initially quick pace of easing under optimal control occurs despite the
costs associated with policy rate adjustments because these costs are judged to
be small when compared with those associated with high unemployment
during and after the recession.
• These simulations illustrate that the absence of inertia in the policy response
has two opposing effects. On the one hand, lowering the policy rate quickly at
the onset of a recession provides additional accommodation; on the other
hand, a more rapid pace of subsequent normalization can offset this
accommodation if it is anticipated by the public. Under our modeling
assumptions, the effective amount of accommodation provided by monetary
easing in a recession depends not so much on how quickly the federal funds
rate is lowered over the first few quarters, but rather on the public’s
expectations about the entire path of the policy rate over the short run and
medium term. Moreover, because changes in the stance of monetary policy
affect the economy with long lags, they can counter only some of the rise in

the unemployment rate and the drop in inflation that accompany large
negative shocks to aggregate demand.
• Several caveats apply to these results. Notably, as in all simulations in this
Tealbook section, it is assumed that the public immediately understands which
policy strategy is being followed by policymakers. But it is possible that the
initial policy actions of policymakers are taken as signals about the nature of
the strategy that policymakers will subsequently follow. For example, a
gradual policy response to an incipient recession of the kind prescribed by the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule could well lead the public to conclude that
s
e policymakers are intent on maintaining a tighter policy stance than that
gi
e
t prescribed by that rule; this conclusion could, in turn, exacerbate the
a
r
S t recession. Moreover, in these simulations, the public perfectly anticipates the
y
c future path of policy, even at long horizons.13 If the public instead had an
li
o
P incomplete understanding of the policy path further in the future, or if the

r

t
e
n term prescriptions of their policy strategies, the pace of monetary policy
o
M
easing at the beginning of the recession could be more important for spending
and pricing decisions than the uncertain normalization phase later on.14
Finally, the model underlying the simulations abstracts from the effects of
policy actions and communications on economic confidence more generally.
A strong and swift monetary policy response at the onset of a recession could
be valuable if it provided a timely boost to economic confidence.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.
13 Our assumption of “model-consistent expectations” implies that the public knows the structure
of the economy, understands policymakers’ strategy concerning current and future settings of the federal
funds rate, and uses that knowledge when forming expectations of future movements in asset prices, wages,
and inflation.
14 Indeed, when we conduct the simulations in this special exhibit under the alternative assumption
that the public forms expectations based solely on historical relationships as represented by small-scale
statistical models (frequently called “VAR-based expectations” in Tealbook A), the difference in effective
accommodation provided by the Taylor (1999) rule and optimal control diminishes considerably.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic
implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as commitment
strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES”
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection. The
table further reports the expression for the rule proposed by Reifschneider and Williams (2000),
as implemented in the special exhibit. denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by

corresponds to the historical value in the economic projection. The right-hand-side variables
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE price inflation for the current
quarter and three quarters ahead ( and ), the output gap estimate for the current period
(ygap), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap (∆4ygap ).

The value of policymakers’ longer-run inflation objective, denoted πLR, is 2 percent.
The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined
as the difference between nominal income, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of the
level of nominal GDP, and a target value, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q∗4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate

of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently,
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of
s

Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and chosen
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objectiv𝐿𝐿e𝐿𝐿 and a longer-run real
𝑟𝑟
federal funds rate of 0.5 percent.3 The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on
the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).
The “Near-term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate. The “Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model
of the U.S. economy.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The measure is
derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based expectations—that is,
agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future variables are
determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and
the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close
3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.
4 For a discussion of this and other concepts of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and
others (2016).

the output gap at the end of this time frame, whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal
funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
s
e
gi large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
e simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
t
a
r simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no

weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.
