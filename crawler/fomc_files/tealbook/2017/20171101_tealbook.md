The data we have received since the September Tealbook indicate that economic DD

activity continues to advance at a solid pace. Smoothing through the effects of the oo
cc

hurricanes, we expect real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second half, cc

unrevised from the previous projection. Payroll employment in the September labor ee
mm
report appeared to be held down markedly by the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, oo
DD
and we expect that job gains will be boosted this month and next as payrolls return to a
more normal level. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2 percent in September,
and the labor force participation rate moved up. Overall, we assess that the economy has
continued to improve at around the same pace we anticipated in the September Tealbook.
Over the medium term, we expect real GDP growth to slow gradually from
2½ percent this year to 2 percent in 2019, and then to 1½ percent in 2020 as monetary
policy continues to tighten. This pace of growth is sufficient to push the level of real
GDP about 2 percent above our estimate of its potential in 2020, similar to our forecast in
September. Likewise, the unemployment rate is projected to fall to 3.6 percent by the
end of 2019 and to remain at that level in 2020, about 1¼ percentage points below our
estimate of its natural rate.
The incoming data on consumer prices through September once again point to
softer-than-anticipated PCE price inflation, and our forecast for core inflation this year is
a bit lower than in the September Tealbook. We still view the low readings this year as
largely transitory and expect core PCE price inflation to pick up next year. However, in
this projection we have carried forward a small portion of this year’s downward inflation
surprise into 2018. Both total and core PCE price inflation are projected to move up from
about 1½ percent this year to 1¾ percent in 2018, and then to 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.
The Effects of the Recent Hurricanes
In recent months, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate caused significant
destruction and dislocation in the United States and its territories.1 As shown in the table,
1 Hurricane Maria has been devastating for Puerto Rico, but we do not include its effects in the
calculations shown, as economic activity in U.S. territories is not included in aggregate U.S. GDP or labor
market statistics. In addition, analysis from the San Francisco Fed suggests that the effects of the wildfires
in California will be too small to noticeably affect the national economic statistics.

we currently estimate that the hurricanes subtracted ½ percentage point at an annual rate
from real GDP growth in the third quarter, the same as in the previous Tealbook. We
factored in the hit to economic activity from two more hurricanes, Irma and Nate, which
made landfall on the U.S. mainland after the time of the September Tealbook projection;
however, we revised down the estimated effect of Harvey.2 As the level of production
returns to its pre-hurricane path, rebuilding continues, and a small portion of lost
spending is made up, we anticipate a boost to growth in the fourth quarter that is slightly
larger than the third-quarter loss. Beyond the near term, the makeup of the lost spending
and production, as well as the rebuilding of damaged property, will be gradual. Thus, the
hurricanes do not leave a discernable imprint on the contour of growth in the medium-
term projection.
 We estimate that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma reduced payroll employment by
200,000 in September.3 That said, we anticipate employment will rebound in
2 This information updates previous estimates of the economic effects of Hurricanes Harvey and
Irma. For more details about those earlier estimates, see the staff memo to the FOMC from September 14,
2017, titled “Preliminary Assessment of Effects of Hurricane Irma on the U.S. Economy and Updated
Assessment of Hurricane Harvey.”
3 The uncertainty around this estimate is large, but it is consistent with data from the household
survey showing an unusually large number of people (1.5 million) being absent from work due to bad
weather during the third week of September, the reference week for the household and payroll surveys.

 For industrial production, the disruptions to the energy and petrochemical ss
ttii
ee
mm
sectors from Hurricane Harvey account for most of the overall hurricane
oo
DD
effect. We estimate activity in affected industries to be returning to normal
over the course of the fourth quarter.
 Retail gasoline prices climbed in the wake of Hurricane Harvey but have since
trended down as production at storm-affected refineries has returned to
normal. We expect this boost to gasoline prices will have reversed by next
month. As a result, the 12-month change in total PCE prices is boosted only
in September and October. Gasoline prices did not move much in response to
the subsequent hurricanes, which caused only modest refinery disruptions.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Fiscal Policy
 At the end of September, congressional and Administration leadership
released a broad framework for tax reform, and the Congress has begun the
initial legislative steps to make policy changes. Nonetheless, considerable
uncertainty remains about the potential size, timing, and composition of
federal tax policy changes that may be enacted. We have retained our
placeholder assumption that a tax cut will increase the primary budget
deficit—that is, the deficit excluding interest costs—by ½ percent of GDP,
and that it will take the form of a reduction in personal income taxes that starts
in the first quarter of 2018 and then begins to be phased out after five years.
This policy action is expected to boost the level of real GDP about ¼ percent
by the end of 2020, exclusive of multiplier effects and any offsets from higher
interest rates and a stronger dollar.
 We anticipate an increase in federal government outlays for hurricane relief of
about $85 billion over the medium term, mostly in the form of transfer

 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule used in our projection calls
for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than 1 percentage point per
year, on average, over the projection period and to average 4 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2020, in line with our previous forecast.
 The SOMA portfolio begins a gradual and predictable decline in the current
quarter as securities are redeemed in a manner consistent with the June 2017
addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise over the medium term from an
average of 2.5 percent in the current quarter to 3.6 percent by the end of 2020.
During this period, the 10‐year valuation window moves through a period of
rising short-term interest rates, and the term premium—the compensation that
investors require for the risk of holding longer-term instruments—is projected
to increase to more normal levels.
 The paths of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond
rate generally follow the contour of the 10-year Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices have come in about 4 percent higher than we had anticipated in
the September Tealbook, and we carried that higher level forward in our
4 Federal government appropriations expire on December 9. We assume the Congress will pass
appropriations in time to avoid a disruption in government operations. That said, a lapse of appropriations
that results in a short-term shutdown of the federal government would have only minor implications for the
outlook. For example, the staff estimated that the 16-day shutdown in October 2013 reduced GDP growth
¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that year and boosted it by an equal amount in the following
quarter. This estimate embodies our judgment that there were no material effects on private investment or
consumption due to reduced confidence or increased uncertainty.

an average annual rate of about 4 percent over the next three years. Despite
ooo
DDD
the brisk pace of house price increases, the ratio of house prices to rents is
projected to remain only marginally above its estimated long-run trend.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 We estimate that foreign economic growth will moderate from an annual rate
of 3¼ percent in the second quarter to a still-strong 2¾ percent pace in the
second half. Over the medium term, we project economic growth abroad to
hover around 2½ percent per year, in line with our estimate of foreign
potential growth.
 After having depreciated around 9 percent year-to-date by the time of the
September Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has since appreciated nearly
2 percent, reflecting in part an increase in U.S. interest rates over this period.
We expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of 1½ percent
through the forecast period, as market expectations for the federal funds rate
move up toward the staff forecast. As a result of the recent appreciation of the
dollar, our projection for the broad real dollar by the end of 2020 is
1¼ percent higher than in the September Tealbook.
Oil Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen to $58 per barrel, about $4 per
barrel higher than at the time of the September Tealbook. The impetus for
this rise comes from foreign developments—political tensions in the Iraqi
Kurdish region and continued efforts by Saudi Arabia to curtail oil supply—
rather than from disruptions to U.S. Gulf Coast production; accordingly, U.S.
benchmark prices have increased by less than Brent prices. In an environment
of robust supply growth, these oil price increases are expected to be
temporary. Indeed, current spot oil prices are somewhat above that of farther-

Real GDP growth is expected to step up from an annual rate of about 2 percent in cc

cc
the first half of this year to 3 percent in the second half, reflecting a positive swing in the ttii
ss
ee
contributions of inventory investment and net exports that we anticipate to be short lived. mm
oo
Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP, are expected to continue to advance at a DD
healthy clip. As mentioned previously, we think the effects of recent hurricanes will
leave little imprint on real GDP growth in the second half.5 For this year as a whole, we
continue to expect real GDP growth of 2½ percent.
 Readings on consumer spending through September were positive, on
balance, and included a jump in motor vehicle sales. Incoming data and
anecdotal reports suggest that much of the spike in motor vehicle sales in
September was attributable to transitory factors—including robust
replacement of vehicles following Hurricane Harvey and a surge in fleet sales
to rental car companies—so we expect sales to drop back in coming months.
We continue to project that real PCE growth will average 2¾ percent over the
second half of the year, a bit above its pace in the first half. Consumer
spending is likely being supported by ongoing gains in income and wealth as
well as by buoyant consumer sentiment. (The box “Student Loan Debt and
Aggregate Consumption” points out that the run-up in student loan debt over
the past decade likely has not been holding down consumption growth
materially.)
 Business investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is expected to
increase at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second half of this year—its
fastest pace since 2014—following a healthy gain of nearly 6 percent in the
first half. This year’s pickup comes on the heels of moribund E&I spending
in 2016 and corresponds to an upswing in several measures of business
optimism and expected profitability. Moreover orders and shipments of
5 Within the second half of the year, we project GDP growth of 2.9 percent in the third quarter and
3.2 percent in the fourth. Despite the swing in output related to the hurricanes, the growth rates for the two
quarters are similar, in part because of the concentration of the inventory and net export boost in the third
quarter. We receive the BEA’s advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter on October 27.

uuu Student Loan Debt and Aggregate Consumption Growth
OOO
&&&
eee lll Between 2001 and 2016, the real amount of student debt owed by American households more than
vvv
eee tripled, from about $340 billion to more than $1.3 trillion. The increase largely reflects an acceleration in
DDD
student loan originations that was mainly due to a surge in college enrollment and ongoing increases in
nnn
ooo
real tuition levels. The expansion of student loan borrowing, and the associated increase in post-college
ccc
EEE
student loan debt service, has raised concerns that this borrowing is constraining consumption and
ccc
tttiii economic growth. Although student debt service is undoubtedly a source of severe financial strain for
sss
eee some individuals, in this discussion we show that the direct effect of increased student debt service on
mmm
ooo aggregate consumption growth is likely small. We also argue that indirect—and hard-to-quantify—
DDD
channels, such as the effect of student loan debt on access to credit or debt aversion, are probably small
as well, but we cannot rule out that these channels could hold down consumption more meaningfully.
It is important to emphasize that as long as student loans are leading to better educational outcomes,
the increase in student loan originations over the past couple of decades could be associated with a
positive effect on consumption growth. Indeed, the existing literature suggests that, on average,
college graduates have substantially higher incomes than high school graduates and that this income
differential may be rising over time.1 Nevertheless, the average returns to education mask substantial
heterogeneity, and there is a concern that the increase in student loan originations since 2001 (and
especially during the Great Recession) was concentrated among students who received little value from
their additional education.2 Moreover, continued increases in tuition costs since the Great Recession
contributed to a rise in post-college debt payments that might have outpaced any education-related
gains in income. Given these concerns, we explore an extreme scenario of what the negative effects of
the loans could be had there been no positive effect of increased education on borrowers’ incomes.3
The most direct way in which increased student loan debt service payments could hold back
consumption is by crowding out other household spending. Had student loan originations stayed at
their 2001 level of roughly $60 billion in real terms per year (the blue dotted line in the figure on the next
page) through the end of the 2015–16 school year, we estimate that annual debt service payments would
have been $50 billion lower by 2016—representing 0.3 percent of personal income.4 Even if we assume
(in the spirit of our upper bound) that those debt payments held back household consumption dollar-
for-dollar, the drag on real GDP growth would be less than 0.05 percentage point in any particular year.5
Although increases in debt payments since 2001 appear to have had, at most, only a small direct effect
on consumption, increased student loan debt could hold back consumption through other indirect
channels. First, high levels of student loan debt may increase debt-to-income ratios or reduce credit
scores, so some borrowers may lose access to other types of loans, such as mortgages and auto or credit
card loans. Curtailed access to credit more broadly could potentially reduce aggregate consumption
1 Christopher Avery and Sarah Turner (2012), “Student Loans: Do College Students Borrow Too Much—or Not
Enough?” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 26 (Winter), pp. 165–92.
2 For instance, enrollment surged in for-profit schools, which are associated with lower returns to education, lower
graduation rates, and higher rates of loan delinquencies.
3 Student loans could also boost consumption through other channels not considered here such as an increase in
education-related expenditures and higher profits for lenders or schools.
4 To estimate this effect, we assume that all student loan debt originated in a given year starts being repaid by
borrowers four years later under a fixed 10-year plan with an interest rate of 6.8 percent—the maximum rate for
undergraduate federal student loan borrowers from 2001 to 2016. Under these assumptions, the effect of increased
originations on debt service payments builds gradually over time.
5 Our strong dollar-for-dollar assumption might be justified if the relevant households are credit constrained. If,
instead, some of the households are unconstrained and forward looking, the higher debt would merely reduce their net
worth, yielding a smaller effect on consumption through the standard wealth effect.

growth beyond the level estimated earlier. There is evidence that student loan borrowers in their mid- uu
OO
20s who are saddled with greater student debt delay their first home purchases, in part because of
&&
reduced access to mortgages.6 However, homeownership by itself does not boost consumption if a
ll
ee
household simply converts from rental to ownership in the same size and quality unit. Moreover, even if vv
ee
a reduced homeownership rate is associated with reduced spending on housing services and home- DD
nn
related durables, the small number of affected households suggests that this effect is not large in the oo
aggregate.7 Although access to auto loans also could be curtailed by student loan debt, higher student EE cc
loan debt does not appear to lower the likelihood of purchasing a vehicle.8 Finally, reduced access to cc
ttii
credit card loans might hold back consumption for some borrowers, although there is no available ss
ee
mm
evidence that we can lean on to quantify this channel.
oo
DD
Second, borrowers may have psychological responses to debt that could affect consumption. In
particular, if borrowers are especially averse to debt, they may choose to curtail consumption to repay
their student loans more quickly. Available evidence points to the existence of debt aversion in different
settings, suggesting this mechanism might play some role in reducing consumption.9
Finally, increases in student loan debt could be problematic for lenders, posing risks to financial stability.
However, we currently view that outcome as unlikely. The federal government guarantees more than
90 percent of outstanding student loan debt, and, thus, financial institutions are not highly exposed to
the associated direct credit risk. Moreover, the subpopulation of borrowers who have been struggling
to meet their student debt obligations typically owe only small amounts on other debts. Consequently,
lenders do not appear to face much indirect exposure through loans to borrowers currently having
trouble paying their student loans.

Reserve System, June), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.010r1.
7 Estimates from Mezza and others (2016) imply that roughly 20 percent of the decline in the homeownership
rate for young adults since 2005 was due to increased student debt. This percentage accounts for less than 800,000
households. If renting has held back the total spending of each of these households by $25,000 annually—the difference
in average spending between homeowners and renters in the Consumer Expenditure Survey—the total effect on
aggregate consumption would be less than $20 billion.

 Residential investment is forecast to decline at an annual rate of 3½ percent in

DD
the second half of the year. Single-family and multifamily housing starts have
been lackluster since the start of the year, in part because there appear to be
some constraints on the availability of labor and developed lots. Sales of
existing homes ticked up in September following three consecutive months of
declines, but they remain below their level from a year ago. Although we
think that this year’s higher mortgage interest rates have contributed to the
recent softening in sales, healthy labor market conditions and increased
household formation point to a gradual improvement in the pace of home sales
next year.
 Government purchases are expected to move sideways, on balance, in the
second half of this year after declining in the first half. The incoming data on
state and local construction spending have been surprisingly weak, and
although we expect construction activity to bounce back somewhat in the
fourth quarter, the contribution of total government purchases to GDP growth
this year is still lower than in the previous Tealbook.
 Net exports are expected to contribute ½ percentage point to real GDP growth
in the second half of 2017 and then to be a neutral influence on growth in
2018. After starting 2017 strong, growth of both exports and imports slowed,
with imports declining in the third quarter, given notable weakness in oil and
consumer goods imports. However, we expect this weakness in overall
imports to be transitory. Growth rates for exports, supported by foreign
demand, are expected to firm this quarter and remain elevated for the rest of
the forecast period. Compared with the September Tealbook, the contribution
of net exports to the rate of real GDP growth is nearly ¼ percentage point
more positive in the second half, reflecting incoming data.

production in the third quarter, but we anticipate factory output to climb
2¾ percent this quarter, consistent with a pickup in automakers’ production
schedules as well as ebullient readings from regional and national
manufacturing surveys.
Over the medium term, we project real GDP will increase 2½ percent in 2018,
2 percent in 2019, and 1½ percent in 2020, a deceleration that reflects the ongoing
tightening of monetary policy.
 Our forecast is little changed relative to the September Tealbook, as the
positive effects of the higher projected trajectory for equity prices are mostly
offset by the negative effects of the stronger path for the dollar.
 We continue to assume that potential GDP growth will edge up to 1¾ percent
by the end of the medium term. With real GDP growth expected to outpace
potential growth throughout much of the projection, resource utilization
tightens further. In 2019 and 2020, real GDP is projected to exceed its
potential level by about 2 percent.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
Looking through the effects of the recent hurricanes on payroll employment,
conditions in the labor market appear to have tightened further in September. We expect
the labor market to continue to tighten over the medium term at about the same pace as in
the September Tealbook projection.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment fell 33,000 in September, and there were
some downward revisions to payrolls in previous months. As noted earlier,
we estimate that the hurricanes reduced payroll employment by 200,000 in
September. Excluding the effects of the hurricanes, we estimate that payroll

 The near-term labor market forecast is little changed, on balance, from the mm

September Tealbook. Excluding the hurricane adjustments, we revised down DD
our current-quarter projection for payroll growth by roughly 15,000, to
176,000 per month. Factoring in a post-hurricane rebound in October and
November, we now project payrolls to rise about 240,000 per month this
quarter. We project the unemployment rate to remain at 4.2 percent through
December; the year-end level is unrevised from our September projection. As
a consequence of some unusual movements in the underlying labor flows data
in September, which we think will largely unwind, we expect that the rise in
the participation rate last month will reverse over the next few months.6 As a
result, the labor force participation rate is forecast to end the year at
62.8 percent, the same as in our previous projection.
 Our projection for the unemployment rate in the current quarter is
½ percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate, and the participation
rate is 0.2 percentage point above its estimated trend. (See the box
“Alternative View: Hysteresis and the Natural Rate Fallacy” for a different
perspective suggesting that the natural rate of unemployment moves with the
actual unemployment rate, and that the natural rate is now substantially lower
than the staff assumes.)
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little revised, the outlook for the
labor market is similar to our September Tealbook projection and calls for a further
tightening of labor market conditions through 2019.
 After decreasing ¾ percentage point over the past two years, the
unemployment rate is projected to decline another ¾ percentage point over the
6 In September, there was a noticeable and unexpected increase in the number of individuals who
moved from out of the labor force to employed, a pattern that, based on history, we expect to largely
reverse by the end of the year.

Alternative View: Hysteresis and the Natural Rate Fallacy
&&&
lll
eee
vvv The most vexing puzzle for U.S. monetary policymakers is the absence of rising
eee
DDD
inflation in the face of the apparent closing of the unemployment rate gap. To account
nnn
ooo for this puzzle, we need to reconsider an implicit assumption behind the staff’s
ccc
EEE
judgmental forecast—namely, the notion that the behavior of the natural rate of
ccc
tttiii
unemployment is independent of the behavior of actual unemployment.
sss
eee
mmm
ooo
Some Keynesians have resisted this implicit assumption. They argue that the fallacy of
DDD
the natural rate hypothesis is in the belief that the natural rate is solely determined by
supply factors that cannot be affected by aggregate demand. They point out the
possibility that as demand pushes unemployment away from the current natural rate,
this causes the natural rate itself to change over time.
This alternative hypothesis, known as “hysteresis,” has been heavily studied in the
research literature, but the degree to which it has been accepted by policymakers in
the United States is less clear. This alternative view updates Ball (1997) to test for the
presence of hysteresis today.1 The approach is to let changes in the inflation rate reveal
innovations to the natural rate. Ball’s method involves an accelerationist Phillips curve
that links changes in the quarterly core PCE inflation rate to the unemployment rate
gap:
(cid:2024) (cid:3398)(cid:2024) (cid:3404)(cid:3398)(cid:1853)(cid:4666)(cid:1873) (cid:3398)(cid:1873)(cid:3015)(cid:4667), (cid:1853) (cid:3408) 0. (cid:4666)1(cid:4667)
(cid:3047) (cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)
This specification has a number of advantages. First, equation (1) uses a Phillips curve
associated with the natural rate hypothesis. Second, because expected inflation is
represented by an observable variable (lagged inflation), the only latent variable in
equation (1) is the natural rate. Third, equation (1) is extremely parsimonious, as it has
only one unknown coefficient.
Following Mankiw (2001), I calibrate a as 1/8 based on what he described as an old
convention that a year of above‐normal unemployment of 1 percentage point is
associated with a ½ percentage point decline in inflation.2 Later, I consider a
significantly flatter Phillips curve and show that it strengthens the results. By inverting
equation (1), one derives the natural rate as
(cid:1873)(cid:3015) (cid:3404)(cid:1873) (cid:3397)(cid:1853)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(cid:4666)(cid:2024) (cid:3398)(cid:2024) (cid:4667). (cid:4666)2(cid:4667)
(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)
The idea is to infer a lower natural rate if inflation is falling. Ball (1997) recommended
taking only the low‐frequency movement from (cid:1873)(cid:3015)measured by a Hodrick‐Prescott (HP)
(cid:3047)

calculated by multiplying 4 (annualization of the quarterly rate) by 1/8 (the slope of the Phillips curve).

b ‐0.02 0.26 0.29
(t‐stat) (‐0.71) (7.40) (6.98)
The table shows the results. During the early sample period, the absence of hysteresis
cannot be rejected, as shown by column (A). In other words, actual events appeared to
support the dichotomy between the actual and natural rates of unemployment in the
earlier sample. However, as shown by column (B), the absence of hysteresis can be
easily rejected in the second sample: One‐fourth of every 1 percentage point change in
(cid:1873) is now transmitted to the natural rate. Column (C) shows the case of assuming a
(cid:3047)
flatter Phillips curve, where the slope of the Phillips curve is assumed to be 5 times
smaller. Because we infer what happened to the natural rate by inverting the Phillips
curve, the flatter the Phillips curve, the larger the change in the natural rate assumed
from a given change in inflation. Thus, the estimate of hysteresis can only go up.
Hysteresis is found only in the second sample period, because the volatility of the
unemployment rate did not change much between the two periods despite a large
reduction in inflation volatility. The only way for the accelerationist Phillips curve to
reconcile the asymmetry of unemployment and inflation volatilities is to infer that the
natural rate must have been tracking the actual unemployment rate in the more recent
period. This procedure indicates that the current point estimate of the natural rate can
be as low as 3.9 (a=1/8) percent or 2.8 (a=1/40) percent.3
The implication for monetary policy is clear: There should be no rush to tighten
monetary policy. The binding effective lower bound in the aftermath of the Great
Recession implied that the economy faced a tremendous demand shock. If hysteresis
was at work, such a shock affected supply in the absence of other stimulative policies.
However, if reverse hysteresis also is now at work, “it might be possible to reverse
these adverse supply‐side effects by temporarily running a ‘high‐pressure economy,’
with robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market.”4
3 Note that if I replace the lagged inflation term in the Phillips curve with anchored inflation
expectations of 2 percent, the point estimates are even lower.

 We project that productivity will increase about 1 percent per year over the
forecast period—slightly below our estimate of its structural pace, though a
little higher than its average over the preceding several years.7
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The incoming data on consumer prices indicate that inflation has been slightly
lower than we anticipated in the September Tealbook.
 Core PCE prices rose 0.1 percent in August, a touch below our expectations in
the previous Tealbook. With the most recent CPI and PPI data in hand, we
estimate that core PCE prices also rose 0.1 percent in September, again less
than we expected, leaving the 12-month change in that month at 1.3 percent.
 We project core PCE prices to continue increasing just 0.1 percent per month
this quarter, held down by the residual seasonality that we see in these data.
We project the 12-month change in core PCE prices to fluctuate between
1.3 and 1.4 percent until March of next year when it steps up to 1.6 percent, as
the unusual decline in core prices seen this past March drops out of the
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly because workers hired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to
workers hired during a slack labor market.

 PCE prices for food increased at a subdued pace of about 1 percent in the first m

half of the year, which is nevertheless a step-up from the declines seen in D
2016. We expect food price inflation to continue to run at about a 1 percent
pace in the second half, held down by recent declines in commodity prices.
 Core import price inflation is expected to step up from a 1½ percent pace in
the third quarter to 3¼ percent in the fourth. Our fourth-quarter inflation
forecast reflects price pressures arising from dollar depreciation and
commodity price increases that occurred in the third quarter. That said, the
second-half increase has been revised down notably relative to the September
Tealbook, reflecting both weaker-than-expected incoming data and an
expected drag from more recent dollar appreciation. Starting in the second
half of 2018, import price inflation is expected to slow to a ¾ percent pace,
consistent with moderate foreign inflation, a gradually appreciating dollar, and
slowly declining commodity prices.
 On balance, the latest readings on longer-term inflation expectations from
survey- and market-based measures accord with our view that these
expectations remain relatively stable.
While the continued soft readings on core inflation give us pause, unexplained
movements of several tenths in inflation are not unusual. Indeed, in 2016, core PCE
inflation, at 1.9 percent, was notably higher than we can readily explain, given our
judgment that soft core import prices and earlier declines in energy prices were holding
down core inflation and that the underlying inflation trend has been lower than
2 percent—that is, 1.8 percent. Nonetheless, while we continue to think that most of this
8 The unusually large decline in wireless telephone plan prices that occurred in March 2017 held
down that month’s core PCE reading about 0.1 percentage point. Other components also contributed to the
low reading in core PCE inflation in that month.

year’s soft core inflation will prove to be transitory, we have taken a small signal from t l
u
O
the recent downward surprises for our 2018 projection.9 As a result, core PCE price
&
inflation is projected to move up to 1.8 percent in 2018, 0.1 percentage point lower than e l
v
e
we had previously projected. For 2019 and 2020, both total and core PCE price inflation D
n
step up further to 2 percent, in line with the September Tealbook projection, as the o
c
E
transitory factors holding down inflation this year abate, resource utilization continues to c
ti
tighten, and our judgmental underlying inflation trend edges higher. e
s
m
o
D
We received only a little news on wages since the previous Tealbook.10 Hourly
labor compensation growth is projected to step up from a pace of 3¼ percent this year to
around 3½ percent in each of the next three years, as the labor market continues to
tighten. Over the medium term, compensation growth is unrevised.
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose
faster than expected in September, and earnings in previous months revised
up, which together boosted the 12-month change to 2.9 percent. We expect
the outsized September rise, which we think in part reflected a hurricane-
related shift in employment away from lower-wage workers, to partially
reverse in October. Even so, we still expect the 12-month change to be
2.8 percent by December, the same as in 2016 but higher than the preceding
several years.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was
3.6 percent in September, also about the same pace as a year ago but up from
earlier years.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment is 4.8 percent in
the longer run, and that potential GDP growth will be 1.7 percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
9 This judgment reflects the fact that this year’s downside misses have been both persistent and
concentrated in the market-based price categories, which tend to be less volatile than nonmarket prices. In
contrast, a large fraction of last year’s higher-than-can-be-explained inflation was driven by unusually high
nonmarket prices, which tend to carry little signal for future inflation.
10 The ECI for September will be released on October 31, the first day of the FOMC meeting.

D

D  PCE price inflation edges up to 2.1 percent in 2021 and hovers slightly above
the Committee’s long-run objective for several years before edging back down
to 2 percent.
 With output materially above its potential level and inflation a bit over the
Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about
1½ percentage points above its long-run value of 2.5 percent in 2021. It then
moves back toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign economic growth seems to be coming off the boil, but the pot continues
to simmer. Recent indicators suggest that growth abroad slowed from an annual rate of
3.2 percent in the second quarter to about 2¾ percent in the third. We had anticipated
some slowing, as activity in some economies—most notably, Canada and Japan—had
been running at an unsustainable pace, and we judge our estimated third-quarter growth
to still be slightly above potential, in contrast to the weakness observed early last year.
The pickup in growth over the past year has been underpinned by a rebound in trade and
k
manufacturing activity around the globe and, in some countries, by stronger investment o
o
l
growth. These factors are still supporting activity, and we have growth staying at near t
u
O
2¾ percent over the remainder of the forecast period. Even though growth abroad &
l
remains at about potential, we see the foreign recovery becoming more self-sustained and e
v
e
less dependent on monetary stimulus over time. Overall, our forecast is little changed D
n
o
relative to the September Tealbook.
c
E
l
’
t
n
Despite our relatively benign forecast, a number of downside risks remain. I
Grabbing headlines of late, political developments in the euro area—including the
separatist movement in Catalonia and increased anti–European Union (EU) populism in
Austria, Germany, and Italy—could intensify, damping the euro-area recovery and
weighing on global growth. This possibility is explored in the “Stronger Dollar and
Weaker Foreign Growth” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Inflation remains stubbornly low in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), with
core inflation running at an estimated annual rate of 1¼ percent in the third quarter. After
plunging to a mere ¼ percent in the second quarter, headline inflation in the AFEs rose to
an estimated 1 percent in the third, as the drag from declining retail energy prices
moderated. We see AFE headline inflation rising further to 1½ percent in the current
quarter and inching higher over the forecast period as output gaps narrow.
With inflation below target in many AFEs and projected to remain so for some
time, we continue to see monetary policies remaining accommodative. We expect the
European Central Bank (ECB) to announce at its October 26 meeting an extension of its
asset purchases through September 2018, albeit at a reduced pace. We also expect the
Bank of Japan (BOJ) to remain on hold. Consistent with the hawkish signals sent by the
Bank of England (BOE) at its September meeting, we believe that a rate hike is

--- Page 41 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) October 20, 2017
imminent, but we still expect the pace of subsequent tightening to be gradual. Similarly,
we see the Bank of Canada (BOC) proceeding cautiously in withdrawing stimulus.
However, AFE inflation could surprise on the upside, triggering a faster-than-expected
normalization of AFE monetary policy and a tightening of global financial conditions.
We discuss such a situation in the “Inflation-Driven Tightening in the AFEs” alternative
scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
In the emerging market economies (EMEs), inflation has been fairly stable in
recent quarters at around 3 percent, with declines in Latin America roughly offset by
increases in emerging Asia, and we expect it to hover at around this pace over the
k forecast period. In contrast to last year’s above-target readings, inflation is now more
o
o subdued in most South American economies, held down by previous monetary policy
l
t
u
O tightening and still-weak domestic demand. Monetary policy in some of these economies
&
l (notably, Brazil and Colombia), as well as in other EMEs, such as India, Indonesia, and
e
v
e Russia, has eased in recent months.

E ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES

I • Euro Area. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth remained near
2½ percent in the third quarter. We project growth to moderate to 2 percent this
quarter and then, as economic slack diminishes, to just above its potential rate of
1½ percent by late 2020. Although political uncertainty is likely to weigh on growth
in Italy and Spain, we do not expect it to derail recovery in the euro area. We assume
that the Catalan independence movement will ultimately lose steam, partly as
attention focuses more closely on the economic costs of exiting the euro area and EU.
That said, heightened tensions in Catalonia and growing anti-EU populism elsewhere
(including in Austria, Germany, and Italy) have increased downside risks to euro-area
prospects.
Core inflation remained subdued at 1.4 percent in the third quarter and is projected to
remain below 1½ percent through 2018, reflecting modest wage growth and the
recent appreciation of the euro. ECB officials now appear to be considering
extending asset purchases into the second half of 2018, albeit at a reduced pace.
Accordingly, we project that the ECB will soon announce an extension of its
purchases through September 2018 at a pace of €20 billion per month (down from
€60 billion a month at present) and will wait until the first quarter of 2019 to begin
raising its policy rate.

• United Kingdom. Incoming data suggest that real GDP grew 1¼ percent in the third
quarter, maintaining its second-quarter pace. Growth is projected to edge up to about
1¾ percent by 2020, supported by a recovery in real wages. Twelve-month inflation,
currently at 3 percent, should fall back to the BOE’s 2 percent target, partly as the
pass-through from earlier sterling depreciation fades. Our reading of the BOE’s
communication following its September meeting is that the central bank is less
willing to look through the elevated inflation rate and will likely raise the policy rate
this quarter, three quarters earlier than assumed in the September Tealbook. We see
the policy rate rising to 1½ percent by the end of 2020, ¼ percent higher than
projected in September.
k
o
• Japan. With consumption indicators weakening, we estimate that GDP growth o
l
t
u
slowed from 2.5 percent in the second quarter to 1½ percent last quarter—still well O
&
above our ¾ percent estimate of potential growth. We expect growth to moderate
l
e
v
further to 1 percent in 2018 before stalling in 2019 because of a legislated increase in e
D
the consumption tax. n
o
c
E
l
In the third quarter—following two quarters of slight deflation—higher energy prices t ’
n
I
and a depreciated yen boosted inflation to an estimated ½ percent, and these factors
should push it up further in the fourth quarter. However, because wage growth
remains sluggish (despite a very tight labor market) and inflation expectations have
not picked up, we expect inflation to be stuck around 1 percent through 2020, well
below the 2 percent target. As such, we see the BOJ maintaining its highly
accommodative policy, with the deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent through 2020 and
asset purchases sufficient to keep the 10-year yield around zero through end-2018. In
parliamentary elections on October 22, we expect Prime Minister Abe’s party to
retain its strong majority, which should provide continued support for the stimulative
policies known as Abenomics.
• Canada. After growing at a blockbuster 4 percent pace in the first half of the year,
driven by unusually strong consumption growth and a pickup in investment in the
energy sector, recent indicators suggest that growth moderated to 2½ percent in the
third quarter. We expect growth to average around 2 percent through mid-2018 and
to settle at its potential pace of 1¾ percent thereafter. Governor Poloz recently
emphasized that the BOC will proceed cautiously with monetary policy normalization
amid heightened uncertainty about the underlying strength of the economy and the

implications of this uncertainty for inflation. We continue to project that the policy
rate (currently at 1 percent) will increase only gradually, reaching 2¾ percent in 2020.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. Real GDP growth slowed to a still-solid 6.6 percent in the third quarter from
7 percent in the first half of the year, a touch above our September Tealbook forecast.
The slowdown reflected some moderation in export and manufacturing activity from
unsustainably strong growth in previous quarters. Although the authorities have
modestly tightened credit conditions since late last year, the effect of this tightening
has been relatively muted. Moreover, in late September, the authorities announced
k
o targeted cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for banks that meet certain thresholds
o
l
t
u for lending to small businesses, which should temper the effect of previous credit
O
& tightening. Nevertheless, we expect GDP growth to slow gradually to 5¾ percent
l
e
v by 2020 as the authorities’ efforts to rein in credit growth gain traction and as
e
D
potential growth slows.
n
o
c
E
l The Chinese Communist Party Congress is under way. President Xi will likely
’
t
n
I emerge from the Congress having significantly consolidated his power within the
Party at the start of his second five-year term. We expect little change in the pace of
market reforms, which has been disappointing in recent years.
• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP growth edged up to a solid
3¾ percent in the third quarter. Growth in the region was boosted by a partial
rebound in India from disruptions following the implementation of the Goods and
Services Tax in July and, elsewhere in the region, by a resurgence in high-tech
exports after a brief hiatus in the second quarter. We expect growth in the region to
rise to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as Indian growth fully recovers, and then to
slow gradually to 3½ percent, about the trend rate, by 2020.
• Mexico. Available data suggest that economic growth, having slowed gradually since
the middle of last year because of tight fiscal and monetary policies, fell further to
1½ percent in the third quarter. Investment contracted markedly in July, and private
consumption growth slowed. Activity was also disrupted, but likely only temporarily,
by two major earthquakes in September. We see growth rising to 2½ percent in the
fourth quarter—boosted by a sharp projected pickup in U.S. manufacturing and a
recovery from earthquake disruptions—and edging up to 3 percent by 2020. Growth
should be supported by diminishing fiscal drag, looser monetary policy, and past

reforms in the energy sector. Downside risks to our forecast are substantial amid
heightened uncertainty about the future of NAFTA, where negotiations have become
bogged down, and political developments ahead of next year’s presidential election.
Officials recently extended the timetable to renegotiate the NAFTA agreement
into 2018.
Despite continued upward pressure from food prices, quarterly inflation fell to
5 percent in the third quarter—down from a peak of 10 percent in the first—as earlier
monetary tightening and peso appreciation have helped bring down core inflation.
We expect the Bank of Mexico, which raised its policy rate a cumulative 400 basis
points between late 2015 and the middle of this year, to begin easing policy

o
in mid-2018. o

• Brazil. Brazil’s economy continues to crawl out of its recession. We estimate that &

real GDP growth picked up to 1½ percent last quarter from 1 percent in the second. v

The recent fall in inflation is boosting real incomes, diminished political uncertainty

However, we see growth rising to only 2 percent in 2018 amid tight fiscal policies. t ’

Inflation has declined from double-digit rates in early 2016 to 2½ percent on a
12-month basis in September, well below the authorities’ 4½ percent target. The
central bank has lowered the policy rate 6 percentage points since September 2016,
and we expect it to cut the rate further to a historic low of 7 percent by the end of
the year.
• Turkey. A number of political developments, including heightened tensions after the
Kurdish referendum in Iraq and diplomatic problems with the United States, led to a
selloff of Turkish assets. With inflation running over 10 percent, a current account
deficit of 4 percent of GDP, and heavy reliance on short-term external financing,
Turkey’s economy is vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment.

Financial Market Developments
Over the intermeeting period, changes in financial asset prices reflected FOMC
communications that were slightly less accommodative than investors anticipated,
domestic economic data releases that came in somewhat stronger than expected on
balance, and increased market expectations for U.S. tax reform. On net, both short- and
longer-dated nominal Treasury yields moved modestly higher, broad equity price indexes
increased, corporate bond spreads narrowed moderately, and the dollar appreciated
against most currencies. There was no discernible reaction in financial markets to the
FOMC’s widely anticipated change in its balance sheet policy.
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability of a rate increase
at the November meeting is close to zero, while the probability of a rate hike
occurring at the December FOMC meeting has increased to about 75 percent.
 Nominal Treasury yields increased modestly, on net, across the curve, with
2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury yields rising 16, 13, and 8 basis points,
respectively. TIPS yields rose slightly more than their nominal counterparts,
leaving inflation compensation a touch lower. Option-adjusted spreads on
current-coupon MBS were little changed.

 On net, broad U.S. equity price indexes ended about 2 percent higher, led by k

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were reportedly seen by
investors as somewhat less accommodative than expected. The Committee’s decision at
the September FOMC meeting to leave the target range for the federal funds rate
unchanged and to announce the start of its balance sheet normalization program in
October had been widely anticipated by the public. However, market participants noted

that the median projections in the September SEP continued to suggest one additional
rate hike of 25 basis points this year and three next year, whereas some investors had
expected slight downward revisions to those median projections. In addition, market
commentaries noted that despite low inflation readings in recent months, the
characterization of the inflation outlook in the statement was little changed, and FOMC
participants made only modest downward revisions to their near-term inflation
projections in the SEP. Chair Yellen’s speeches and other communications by FOMC
participants over the intermeeting period were also seen as reinforcing expectations for
further gradual removal of policy accommodation.
Domestic economic data releases over the intermeeting period came in mostly
above expectations and reportedly also contributed some to investors’ confidence in the
prospect of continued policy rate increases. Judging from futures quotes and without
adjusting for term premiums, market participants appeared to place essentially zero
probability on the next rate increase occurring at the November meeting, while the odds
of a rate hike at the December meeting rose from 50 percent just prior to the September
FOMC meeting to close to 75 percent.1 The probability currently assigned to a
December rate hike is higher than those seen before the rate increases in December 2015
and December 2016 at comparable dates, likely reflecting in part recent FOMC
communications that were interpreted as indicating stronger support among FOMC
members for a rate increase by year-end than in the two previous episodes. Furthermore,

intermeeting period, with yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury securities higher by 16,
13, and 8 basis points, respectively. Treasury yields rose not only following the
September FOMC meeting communications and mostly better-than-expected domestic
data releases, but also following the release of the GOP’s tax reform framework. Staff
models attributed the increase in medium- and longer-term Treasury yields about equally
to increases in expected rates and term premiums. Geopolitical developments over the
intermeeting period appeared to have left little imprint on yields on balance. Near-term
1 According to a staff model that adjusts for term premiums, market quotes implied a probability
of a rate hike by year-end of close to 90 percent. About 96 percent of respondents to the October Blue
Chip Financial Forecasts saw the December meeting as the most likely timing of the next rate increase.

measures of option-implied volatility on 10-year swap rates were little changed, on net,
over the intermeeting period and remained near historically low levels.
Since the September FOMC meeting, the 5- and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based
measures of inflation compensation have both edged lower by 5 basis points on net. The
September CPI data were slightly below expectations, and inflation compensation
measures moved down following the release.
Option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS over Treasury yields were little
changed over the intermeeting period. The Committee’s announcement at the September
FOMC meeting that it would initiate its balance sheet normalization program in October
appeared to have little effect on MBS spreads, as the announcement of gradual securities
redemptions was well anticipated.
The S&P 500 index increased just over 2 percent, on net, while the Russell 2000
index was up just over 4 percent. Broad equity price indexes reacted only modestly to
the release of the GOP’s tax plan on September 27. However, market participants cited
increased expectations of tax reform as supporting the Russell 2000’s outperformance,
particularly on the day of the announcement, when the Russell 2000 increased nearly
2 percent; this index is heavily weighted toward domestically oriented firms that would
presumably benefit more from a corporate tax cut than larger, more internationally
focused firms. Indeed, stock prices of small firms with relatively high domestic tax
s
t
e
liabilities outperformed small firms with relatively low domestic tax liabilities over the k
r
a
intermeeting period. Likely because of proposed tax policy reforms along with the rise in M
l
Treasury yields, financial companies also outperformed broader market indexes. On net, a
ci
n
bank equities increased around 4 percent over the intermeeting period. Meanwhile, one- a
n
month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—remained
Fi
extremely low, reaching an all-time daily low at the close on October 5.
Spreads on yields of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over
comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed modestly. Corporate bond spreads
remained quite low by historical standards, particularly for speculative-grade bonds,
which are below the 10th percentile of their historical range. The low levels of corporate
bond spreads likely reflect elevated investor risk tolerance as well as low expected
defaults.

Foreign Developments
Since the previous FOMC meeting, the broad dollar index has moved up about
1½ percent amid the rise in U.S. interest rates. Increased support for anti-EU parties in
the German and Austrian elections and political uncertainty surrounding the Catalonia
referendum weighed on the euro at times but did not seem to have a material imprint on
net. The British pound depreciated 2½ percent against the dollar, in part because of a
lack of progress in Brexit negotiations. The Mexican peso depreciated more sharply and
is down about 5½ percent against the dollar on uncertainty around NAFTA negotiations
and political developments in Mexico. Increased political tensions between the United
States and Turkey put further downward pressure on the Turkish lira, which was lower by
about 4½ percent over the period.
Over the intermeeting period, market-based measures of expected policy rates in
AFEs were little changed, and longer-term yields edged lower, with the exception of
Japan. The declines in German yields have been linked to political developments in
Europe and, to a greater extent, reports that the ECB may soon extend its asset purchase
program through September 2018, potentially signaling more accommodation than
previously anticipated by market participants. Canadian yields declined following dovish
comments by Bank of Canada Governor Poloz.
Most global equity indexes moved 1 to 4 percent higher over the intermeeting
period, and measures of implied volatility remained well below long-run averages. An t s
e
k
exception is Spain, where equity prices fell following the Catalan independence r
a
M
referendum. The aggregate MSCI EME equity index was near its historical high amid

continued strength in flows to EME equity funds.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets remained stable over the
intermeeting period. Aside from quarter-end, the effective federal funds rate held steady
at 1.16 percent, and rates and volumes in other unsecured and secured overnight and term
funding markets remained stable. Assets under management and net yields of MMFs
were little changed. Excluding quarter-end, ON RRP take-up averaged about
$150 billion. At the end of September, the changes in money market rates and volumes

2 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $11 billion of maturing Treasury securities,
purchased $25 billion of MBS under the reinvestment program, and did not roll any MBS settlements.
While the FOMC’s new balance sheet policy was effective October 1, the first Treasury auction with
reduced Federal Reserve participation occurred on October 19, and MBS purchases were first reduced on
October 16. There was no measurable market reaction in either case. See the Balance Sheet Projections
section of Tealbook B for a summary of expected SOMA redemptions in coming months.
On October 19, the Board conducted a test TDF operation that offered seven-day term deposits at
a rate of 1 basis point over the IOER rate with a maximum award per counterparty of $1 billion. Take-up
totaled $14.1 billion, which was in line with expectations, with 28 banks participating and 11 maximum

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households continued to be
broadly accommodative and supportive of growth in spending and investment in
recent months.
• Gross financing flows to large nonfinancial businesses through capital markets
continued to be robust amid highly accommodative conditions.
• In contrast, the growth of bank-intermediated credit to such firms remained
relatively sluggish. Respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported weaker demand for loans
by business customers amid highly competitive lending conditions.
• Consumer credit growth has moderated compared with the rates of increase seen
in previous years. Credit appeared to be available for most borrowers, although
conditions remained tight in the subprime credit card market. According to the
SLOOS, banks again tightened their credit policies on consumer loans during the
past three months.
• The collapse in Puerto Rican bond prices following Hurricane Maria left little
imprint in the broader municipal bond market.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
During the intermeeting period, financing through capital markets to large
nonfinancial firms remained very robust amid highly accommodative market conditions.
Gross issuance of corporate bonds dipped a bit in September but remained high overall
by historical standards in the third quarter. Institutional leveraged loan originations were
moderate in September, owing to a slowdown of issuance used for refinancing purposes,
s
while new-money originations remained robust and implied risk spreads remained quite n
o
low by historical standards. Gross equity issuance was solid in September, with seasoned di
ti
n
equity offerings at about their average pace over the past few years, and initial public o
C
offerings picking up somewhat following a slower-than-typical summer. g

In contrast to the robust capital market activity, growth in banks’ C&I loans
continued to be sluggish, although the rate picked up a bit in the third quarter. Responses
to the October SLOOS suggest that lackluster demand among banks’ business customers
was a key factor in this subdued growth. The survey also reported a notable increase in
the share of banks that narrowed loan spreads for C&I loans to firms of all sizes over the
past three months, with many respondents, on net, citing more aggressive competition
from other bank or nonbank lenders as an important reason for doing so. The box
“Which Borrowers Account for the Recent Decline in Banks’ Commercial and Industrial
Loan Growth?” provides a disaggregated analysis of the industrial sectors and geographic
regions that have driven the step-down in C&I lending in recent quarters.
The credit performance of bonds and loans extended to nonfinancial corporations
remained strong over the intermeeting period. In September, the volume of nonfinancial
corporate bond upgrades roughly matched that of downgrades, while the six-month
trailing bond default rate remained near its lowest level since 2014. The outlook for
corporate earnings remained broadly favorable, as the strong projections by Wall Street
analysts for year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 companies were essentially unrevised.
Corporations’ aggregate interest expenses relative to earnings remained at historical lows
even as the aggregate ratio of debt to assets for this sector inched up to its highest level in
more than two decades.
Small Businesses
Overall, credit market conditions for small businesses remained stable, with small
business lending activity staying relatively flat in recent months. The latest readings
from several surveys, including the October SLOOS, continued to suggest that the limited
growth in small business lending activity is due to weak demand for credit rather than
tight credit standards. Delinquency rates on existing small business debt remained just
above record-low levels.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing flows for commercial real estate were more robust in capital markets
s
n
than from banks in the third quarter. CRE loan growth at banks decelerated, especially o
ti
di
for nonfarm nonresidential loans. In the October SLOOS, banks reported that demand
n
o
for CRE loans had weakened over the third quarter on net. SLOOS respondents also C

Which Borrowers Account for the Recent Decline in Banks’
Commercial and Industrial Loan Growth?
Domestic commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth at banks has declined noticeably this
year. In particular, over recent quarters, C&I loans at the largest U.S. banks expanded at a
seasonally adjusted annualized rate of about 1½ percent, on average, after having grown at a
pace of nearly 7 percent in 2016 and 11 percent both in 2015 and in 2014.1 In this discussion
we provide some new information about the borrowers that account for the slowdown
based on an analysis of banks’ loan-level data.
We focus on C&I lending by the set of large domestic banks that undergo the Federal
Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR banks. These banks
hold about 70 percent of the C&I loans outstanding on domestic banks’ balance sheets and
account for more of the recent step-down in aggregate C&I lending than would be
suggested by their share of C&I loans alone.
Figure 1 ranks the industries, from left to right, to which the CCAR banks have reported the
largest decline in recent C&I lending (the tan bars), relative to an earlier base period,
2014:Q1 to 2016:Q3 (the blue bars). While the recent decline in banks’ C&I lending has been
widespread across industries, the step-down has been most pronounced for borrowers in
the oil and gas and manufacturing sectors.2 The oil and gas sector witnessed a sizable
contraction in outstanding loans in recent quarters after remaining about flat in the earlier
period, while the manufacturing sector experienced subdued positive lending compared
with robust lending in the earlier period. Together, these two sectors account for about
45 percent of the recent slowdown in C&I lending at the CCAR banks.
1 These numbers are based on staff calculations using the Board’s weekly FR 2644 data (“Weekly Assets
and Liabilities of Domestically Chartered Commercial Banks and U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign
Banks”). In this discussion, we do not consider C&I loans booked by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks; these institutions account for about 18 percent of the C&I loans outstanding to U.S. nonfinancial
corporations. Growth in such C&I loans has also stepped down significantly this year.
2 Within the manufacturing sector, borrowers in the industry subsegments of computer and electronic
products as well as chemicals account for particularly large shares of the recent decline in C&I loan growth.

--- Page 64 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) October 20, 2017
Figure 2 shows that the recent decline in C&I loan growth has been widely evident across
geographic regions of the United States, with businesses headquartered in all but one
Federal Reserve District having experienced such a decline. The declines in C&I loans
outstanding in the Dallas and Kansas City regions primarily reflect the reduction in lending to
borrowers in the oil and gas industries. The declines in other Districts, such as San Francisco,
Richmond, Atlanta, and New York, reflect the broader step-down in C&I lending across
industries.
While the factors behind the decline in C&I loan growth across the industrial sectors and
geographic regions depicted in figures 1 and 2 are difficult to precisely identify, the decline in
banks’ exposure to borrowers in the oil and gas industry began last year, likely in light of
greater realized and anticipated losses on loans to this sector amid prolonged declines in
energy prices. For example, when answering special questions in the April 2016 Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported that they
anticipated greater losses on their loans to the oil and gas sector and had tightened their
lending standards and terms on such loans in response.
We believe that the likely cause of the slowdown in lending to borrowers in other industrial
sectors is a broad-based reduction in businesses’ demand for bank credit. Indeed,
respondents to the SLOOS have indicated that demand for C&I loans from firms of all sizes
has weakened, on balance, in each of the first three quarters of 2017. Banks have cited a
range of reasons for this general weakening in their customers’ demand for C&I loans,
including borrowers’ increased usage of alternative sources of financing—such as retained
earnings, the capital markets, or other nonbank lenders—as well as fewer planned finance
investment projects or merger and acquisition activity.

With respect to capital markets, CMBS issuance has continued to be robust and in
line with last year’s pace. Spreads on lower-rated CMBS have widened slightly since the
September FOMC meeting but remained near the lower end of the range seen since the
financial crisis. Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools continued to decline in
September, largely reflecting the shrinking share of risky loans that were originated
before the financial crisis.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative on
balance, as the collapse in Puerto Rican bond prices following Hurricane Maria left little
imprint in the broader municipal bond market. Gross issuance of municipal bonds
remained solid in September, while the overall credit quality of the state and local
government sector remained stable, with the number of ratings upgrades approximately
matching that of downgrades. Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds
have moved roughly in line with comparable-maturity Treasury securities since the
September FOMC meeting.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative
for most borrowers. The rate on 30-year conforming mortgages offered to well-qualified
borrowers hovered around 4 percent, quite low by historical standards. However, credit
standards remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or with hard-to-document
incomes. Mortgage originations for home purchases have slowed in recent months;
responses to the October SLOOS suggested that weaker demand may underlie some of
the recent slowdown.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely
accommodative on balance. Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace through the s
n
o
third quarter, in line with the more subdued pace of growth observed earlier in 2017 ti
di
relative to the fairly rapid pace in the previous few years. ABS issuance funding n

Banks continued to report tightening their credit policies for auto and credit card
loans in the October SLOOS. Credit bureau data on loan originations and credit limits
suggest that this tightening has been most pronounced in the subprime segment of the
market. In response to a special set of questions, SLOOS respondents identified the most
important reasons for tightening in the subprime sector over this year as a more uncertain
economic outlook and an expected deterioration in loan portfolio performance. In the
case of auto loans, respondents also cited a reduced tolerance for risk, increased concerns
about regulatory or supervisory changes, and concerns about a future decrease in
collateral values. Notwithstanding this reported tightening by the banking sector, credit
bureau data indicate that subprime auto loan originations overall have declined only a bit
after having rebounded substantially since the financial crisis. In contrast, credit card
limits for subprime borrowers have been almost flat for several years and remained at
very subdued levels.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n c
U
&
As in the September Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of s
k
s
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark Ri
used by the FOMC. Many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted as
reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued. For example, both corporate
bond spreads and the VIX remain near the low end of their historical ranges. That said,
considerable uncertainty remains about the future direction of a number of federal
government policies.
We continue to judge the risks around our medium-term projection for GDP
growth as being balanced. We view the risks around the unemployment rate projection
as being in line with those for GDP and therefore also balanced. Consistent with that
view, estimates of the distribution of risks around the staff forecasts for GDP growth and
the unemployment rate conditional on available indicators, shown in the exhibit “Time-
Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly skewed. Moreover, as shown in the
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the risk of returning to the ELB
sometime over the next three years has edged down recently and stands at about
16 percent.1
With regard to inflation, we still see the current level of uncertainty around our
projection as in line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside
and upside as roughly balanced. This assessment is consistent with the estimates of the
time-varying risks for the inflation forecast. To the downside, this year’s string of soft
readings on inflation could prove to be more persistent than we have assumed. Also, we
think there is a risk that inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could
be lower currently than in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming years as we
have assumed. To the upside, with the economy projected to be moving further above its
long-run potential, inflation may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.
1 If the ELB risk were computed around the path for the median federal funds rate from the
FOMC’s September Survey of Economic Projections (SEP), the probability would be 24 percent, reflecting
the lower funds rate path in the SEP compared with that in the Tealbook.

Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly

n remain at an elevated level and have edged up over the past few months. However, these
U
& valuation pressures have not been accompanied by an increase in other vulnerabilities.
s
k Borrowing in the nonfinancial sector continues to increase at only about the same pace as
s
Ri
nominal GDP. While aggregate leverage among corporations remains elevated,
borrowing by the riskiest firms has slowed in recent years. Vulnerabilities from leverage
in the financial system continue to be low, as both banks and insurance companies are
highly capitalized by historical standards. Vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity
transformation also remain low, partly because large bank holding companies’ use of
short-term wholesale funding remains moderate and the decline in assets under
management at prime money market mutual funds appears to have reduced run risk.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first scenario, a different
inflation process is assumed in which both the wage and price Phillips curves are even
flatter and inflation expectations are lower than in the baseline, and in which the negative
inflation shocks seen this year continue next year. In contrast, the second scenario
examines the upside inflation risk that the response of wages and, in turn, prices to a
further tightening of labor market conditions will be stronger than we have assumed and
that inflation expectations will be more responsive to a rise in actual inflation. In the
third scenario, we present the implications of a marked correction in asset valuations.
The fourth scenario illustrates the effects of a lower natural rate of unemployment that is
initially misperceived by policymakers. The fifth scenario studies the implications of a
stronger economy. The sixth scenario analyzes the effects of a resurgence of political
risks in Europe that undermines confidence in the recovery and weakens foreign
economic growth, leading to an appreciation of the dollar. The last scenario envisions a
pickup of inflation in the AFEs that prompts faster monetary policy normalization
abroad, thereby tightening financial conditions in the global economy.

Different Inflation Process [FRB/US] k s

Ri
In the baseline forecast, PCE price inflation is projected to reach 2 percent in
2019. This outlook is consistent with a relatively flat Phillips curve and well-anchored
long-run inflation expectations—features incorporated in both the judgmental forecast
apparatus and the FRB/US model. However, it is possible that the process for inflation
has changed in ways that are not incorporated in the baseline projection for inflation. In
particular, the Phillips curve may be even flatter, and thus the projected tight economy
may contribute much less—if at all—to the return of inflation to the 2 percent objective.
Furthermore, inflation expectations may react more to actual inflation than in the
baseline. In this scenario, we use parameters that have been reestimated for the price–
wage block of the FRB/US model on the (admittedly rather short) post-2000 sample
period, which yields a flatter Phillips curve and a greater role for expectations than in the
standard version of the model. Even with the flatter Phillips curve, the model is unable to
account for the low inflation readings over the past year. While the staff assumes that
only a small portion of the downward surprise to inflation persists into next year, this
scenario carries the entire surprise forward through next year and then assumes that it
gradually fades out.
Under these circumstances, the flatter Phillips curve essentially eliminates the
upward pressure to inflation from tightening labor resources in the baseline, and the
negative shocks to prices also contribute to lower inflation. This lower actual inflation
feeds through into lower inflation expectations and—given the greater role of these
expectations in driving actual inflation—results in more downward pressure on inflation
than would otherwise be the case. As a result, inflation hovers around 1 percent in 2018
and 1½ percent until the end of 2020 before reaching only 1¾ percent in 2022.
2 The four models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; a calibrated DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market; an estimated
medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy based on Del Negro, Giannoni, and
Schorfheide (2015); and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

Alternatively, the projected further tightening of resource utilization in the k
s
Ri
baseline could cause inflation to rise much faster than projected. Some recent research
suggests that the relationship between labor utilization and wage growth, and hence price
inflation in the FRB/US model, may become stronger—the Phillips curve may steepen—
when the labor market is very tight.3 This scenario captures that risk by boosting the
response of wages to tightening labor utilization, and by assuming that longer-run
inflation expectations become more sensitive to the higher realized price inflation that
stems from faster wage growth.4
Inflation reaches 3 percent by 2022, compared with about 2 percent in the
baseline. In response to the higher path of inflation, the federal funds rate rises more and
peaks at 5 percent in 2022; real longer-term interest rates are also slightly higher. As a
result, real GDP growth is a bit slower, and the unemployment rate is about ¼ percentage
point above the baseline by the end of 2022.
Market Correction [FRB/US]
Broad equity market indexes have increased significantly since last year, and
standard equity valuation measures, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, suggest elevated
valuation pressures. Moreover, interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and high-
yield bonds currently are near their lowest levels since the financial crisis. While some of
the decline in bond spreads reflects improvements in the credit quality of these
borrowers, estimates of bond risk premiums suggest that bondholders are now more
3 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth and slack, see, for example,
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet? Assessing Progress toward Full
Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vol. 9 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas, October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf; and Jeremy
Nalewaik (2016), “Non-Linear Phillips Curves with Inflation Regime-Switching,” Finance and Economics
Discussion Series 2016-078 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),
http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.078.
4 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the
current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of the increase reflects a comparison between
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

term premium will move toward historically average levels. t

In this scenario, we assume that both equity and bond risk premiums return more c

U
quickly to historically normal levels. By the middle of next year, equity prices fall about
&
20 percent; the term premium on Treasury securities rises halfway to its assumed long- s
k
s
run value; and the triple-B corporate bond spread rises about 30 basis points above the
Ri
baseline, enough to move it back close to its median historical value. The market
correction is assumed to cause an erosion in consumer and business sentiment.
Real GDP growth slows to about 1¾ percent in 2018, roughly ¾ percentage point
less than in the baseline. The unemployment rate remains around 4 percent through
2022. With labor market utilization less tight and inflation also slightly lower, the federal
funds rate rises more gradually and is 3½ percent at the end of 2020, about ½ percentage
point below the baseline.
The asset price declines in this scenario have relatively mild consequences, in
striking contrast to the decline in house prices before the Great Recession. This outcome
reflects in part our assumption in this scenario that the losses resulting from these market
corrections do not primarily fall on leveraged households and financial intermediaries
and do not result in major disruptions in the functioning of interbank and other financial
markets.
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [Search and Matching
Model]
In the baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to 3.6 percent by the end of
2019, with the natural rate of unemployment unchanged at 4.8 percent. This scenario
assumes that the natural rate of unemployment declines 1 percentage point over the next
few years. The natural rate could be driven lower by a variety of influences, such as
demographic factors or improvements in job-matching efficiency. A lower natural rate
might also reflect the effects of a sustained low actual unemployment rate if “hysteresis”
was at play, as suggested in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook box
“Alternative View: Hysteresis and the Natural Rate Fallacy.” In this scenario, we
assume that the source of a lower natural rate is a decline in worker bargaining power. In
addition, we assume that learning about the lower natural rate occurs only gradually and,
thus, that a considerable gap between the actual and perceived natural rates persists
through the end of 2022.

Economic activity is somewhat stronger than in the baseline as firms create more
y
t jobs and expand production in response to lower wages. As a result, the unemployment
n
ai
t rate falls to 3¼ percent by the end of 2019. However, because the unemployment rate
r
e
c
n does not decline as much relative to the baseline as the true natural rate does, resource
U
& utilization is less tight, and inflation remains persistently below the baseline through the
s
k end of 2022. Despite the lower path for inflation in this scenario, the federal funds rate is
s
Ri
only slightly lower than the baseline because of policymakers’ misperception of the
degree of tightness in the labor market.
Stronger Economy [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model]
Business investment grew faster this year than in the previous year, which may
indicate that the underlying pace of real activity is stronger than assumed in the baseline.
Moreover, labor market conditions have tightened further, and several surveys show
upbeat consumer and business sentiment in recent months. Motivated by these positive
developments, this scenario assumes faster growth in consumer and business spending
than in the baseline.
Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 3 percent in 2018, compared with a
2¼ percent pace in the baseline. The unemployment rate falls more rapidly, bottoming
out at 3¼ percent in 2019 and remaining lower than in the baseline for some time
thereafter. The Phillips curve in this model is very flat—typical of this class of estimated
DSGE models—such that inflation is essentially unchanged from the baseline.5 This is in
contrast to the large movements of inflation in the first two scenarios, in which the
Phillips curve is modified and inflation is shocked directly. In response to faster
economic growth, the funds rate path is somewhat higher than in the baseline, reaching
4½ percent in 2020, about ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.
Stronger Dollar and Weaker Foreign Growth [SIGMA]
Although the dollar has depreciated on balance over the past year as economic
growth abroad has picked up, the foreign economies continue to face risks, including a
slowdown in China and sizable spillovers to EMEs from U.S. monetary policy
normalization. More recently, the rise of populist and antiestablishment parties within
Europe—as well as the Catalan independence movement in Spain—could set in motion a
new wave of political instability. In this scenario, we assume that some of these

Weaker foreign demand and the stronger dollar depress U.S. real net exports.
Consequently, U.S. real GDP expands 2 percent in 2018 and 1½ percent in 2019, about
¼ percentage point less than in the baseline. The U.S. unemployment rate remains above
the baseline through 2022. Amid lower resource utilization and falling import prices,
U.S. core PCE inflation is only 1½ percent in 2018, about ¼ percentage point below the
baseline, and runs below 2 percent through 2020. The federal funds rate follows a
shallower path than in the baseline, rising to only 3¾ percent by the end of 2022.
Inflation-Driven Tightening in the AFEs [SIGMA]
In our baseline forecast, we see underlying inflation in the AFEs gradually
returning to central bank targets, supported by accommodative monetary policy. Given
the tightness of labor markets, however, a sharper-than-expected pickup in inflation could
prompt AFE central banks to embark on markedly faster policy normalization than in the
baseline, tightening financial conditions both there and elsewhere in the world. In this
scenario, we assume that such a risk materializes. Inflation in the AFEs rises
½ percentage point relative to the baseline in 2018, inducing their central banks to
increase policy rates more aggressively than what is prescribed by the baseline policy
rule. The faster policy normalization triggers an increase in AFE corporate and
household borrowing spreads, and a rise in AFE sovereign bond yields, including through
effects on term premiums. Tighter financial conditions in the AFEs spill over to the rest
of the world, and the broad real dollar depreciates 5 percent.
Lower foreign demand and tighter financial conditions weigh on economic
activity in the United States, notwithstanding the stimulus to net exports from the
depreciation of the dollar. U.S. GDP growth moderates to 2 percent in 2018, about
¼ percentage point below the baseline, and core PCE inflation runs a touch below the
baseline through 2022. The federal funds rate rises more slowly than in the baseline,
reaching only 3¾ percent in 2022.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
t
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. In the special exhibit “Estimates of the Equilibrium
Real Federal Funds Rate in the Longer Run,” we summarize recent evidence on the
longer-run equilibrium real federal funds rate from several time-series econometric
models as well as forecasts from various surveys.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), a first-difference rule, and a nominal income
(NI) targeting rule. These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for
the output gap and core inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels. The
middle panel also provides the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is
constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules are somewhat
lower in the near term than in the September Tealbook, primarily reflecting
the downward revisions to the staff’s near-term projections for core inflation.
The prescriptions from these rules, which do not feature interest rate
smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding policy rates in the
Tealbook baseline.
• The prescriptions of the first-difference rule are also somewhat lower in the
near term than those in the September Tealbook, again reflecting the
downward revisions to the staff’s near-term projections for core inflation.
• Under the NI targeting rule, the federal funds rate responds to the current
output gap and the shortfall of the GDP price deflator from the level it would
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Except for the
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined herein use as the intercept term
a value of 50 basis points, equal to the longer-run real federal funds rate assumed by the staff.

2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the September 2017 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r*.

have attained had it increased at an annual rate of 2 percent since 2011:Q4; the
current shortfall in the GDP price deflator is about 4 percent. Unlike the other
rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, the NI targeting rule does not call for
raising the federal funds rate in the near term from its current level because
this rule tries to make up for the shortfall in the GDP price deflator.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term notion of
the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two alternative baselines: the
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians of the September 2017
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).2 Both estimates use the FRB/US model to
conduct the necessary simulations. This notion, labeled FRB/US r*, corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (starting in
the current quarter), would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• At 2.56 percent, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is slightly
higher than in the September Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s slightly larger
projected output gap in the medium term. The average projected real federal
funds rate in the Tealbook baseline, at 0.99 percent, is 1½ percentage points
below the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*.
• At 0.83 percent, the SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because output exceeds its potential value by
a considerably smaller amount in coming years under the median SEP
projections than in the Tealbook forecast despite a lower median path for the
real federal funds rate in the SEP. The average projected federal funds rate
under the SEP-consistent baseline, at 0.34 percent, is ½ percentage point
lower than the SEP-consistent FRB/US r*.
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the September 2017 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a
smooth and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered
in the SEP—for example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

• The fact that, for each projection, FRB/US r* is higher than the corresponding
12-quarter average projected real federal funds rate may reflect factors other
than closing of the output gap in three years that are embedded in the
Tealbook-baseline reaction function and in FOMC participants’ views on the
course of appropriate policy.
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and
s the NI targeting rule. These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output
e
gi
e gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified
t
a
r policy rules.3 The simulations are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers
t
S
y commit to following the prescriptions of each rule in the future and that financial market
c

P

a

e implications of policymakers doing so.4

• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, the federal funds rate increases, on
average, a little less than 1 percentage point per year through 2020. The
federal funds rate peaks at 4 percent in 2021 before slowly moving toward its
longer-run level of 2½ percent.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial tightening of
monetary policy, with the real federal funds rate exceeding the corresponding
Tealbook values by ¾ percentage point or more over the remainder of this
decade. Despite this relatively sharp tightening, the unemployment rate is at
most about ¼ percentage point higher in coming years under Taylor (1999)
than in the Tealbook baseline. The reason the sharp tightening of policy under
the Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy
is that agents in the model are forward looking and correctly anticipate that
monetary policy beyond the period shown will be more accommodative than
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.
4 In contrast to our modeling assumptions, the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the
FOMC might well entail a period during which the public learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic
implications. However, we abstract here from considerations of this kind.

under the Tealbook baseline. This anticipation makes unemployment lower
than it would otherwise be. It also helps raise inflation modestly above the
Tealbook baseline over the period shown because inflation in the FRB/US
model is sensitive to anticipated macroeconomic developments over
long periods.
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp policy tightening but
otherwise prescribes lower policy rates than does the Taylor (1999) rule over
the period shown because it responds less strongly to the projected rise in
output above its potential level. Because the path of interest rates is not as
high as in the case of the Taylor (1999) rule, and because agents correctly
anticipate the path, the unemployment rate is closer to its Tealbook baseline
path in the near term and is lower over the remainder of the period shown.
Similarly, inflation under the Taylor (1993) rule exceeds inflation under the
Tealbook baseline by more than under the Taylor (1999) rule.
• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate for the next three years than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower
path for some years thereafter. The latter difference occurs because the first-
difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap
rather than to its level, reacts to the narrowing of the output gap over the next
decade. The associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction
with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer-term
real interest rates than in the Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of
resource utilization and inflation. Thus, the first-difference rule generates
outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower than, and inflation
outcomes that exceed, the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook baseline
projection.
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the
federal funds rate than the other rules because this rule seeks to compensate
for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as measured by the growth rate of the
GDP price deflator) from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.
Because we assume that policymakers credibly commit to closing this gap and
that economic agents correctly anticipate the long period of low federal funds
rates, the path of the real 10-year Treasury rate is lower than under the other
policy rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years. Accordingly, the

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

path for the unemployment rate is substantially lower than for all the other
simulations shown, dropping to nearly 3 percent in 2020.
• The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are slightly higher in the
medium term than those obtained conditional on the September Tealbook
projection. The changes primarily reflect the staff’s small upward revisions to
the projected output gap in the medium term.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.6
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path.7 This higher path arises
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome
that policymakers in the model judge to be costly. The tighter policy results
in a path for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers secure improved economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from
the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). Furthermore,
these promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants. Under
the alternative assumption of optimal policy under discretion, which does not rely on the credibility of
policymakers’ promises, the results differ significantly only in the simulation in which there is an
asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.
7 When we use the SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal funds rate
under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at just below 4 percent in 2020:Q3
compared with 6½ percent in 2020:Q4 under the Tealbook baseline.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in
the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with the
limited response of inflation to the level of resource utilization in the
FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal
weights; it is also below the Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric
loss function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered
by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment. Because
the public believes that policymakers will follow through on this policy rate
path even as the unemployment rate substantially undershoots its natural rate,
the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2 percent somewhat more quickly
than in the case of equal weights. Starting in the middle of the next decade
(not shown), the unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for
several years as policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures
stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization.8
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical to that specification. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly
more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming
years. The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an
8 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and the undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “Asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time inconsistent in the sense that, if given the opportunity to re-optimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function.

unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds only weakly to resource
utilization. Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to raise inflation in the
near term only a modest amount—an outcome that is seen as costly under this
specification of the loss function.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but
that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than
s

gi

the equal-weights case over the period shown, even though this policy keeps
the unemployment rate much closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate

• The federal funds rate paths prescribed by optimal control under the above
loss functions are somewhat higher, on average over the period shown, than in
the September Tealbook. These higher paths primarily reflect the fact that, in
the staff’s current projection, the unemployment rate is slightly lower in
relation to its natural rate than was the case in the September Tealbook.
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate in the longer run—denoted
rLR—is the rate consistent with the economy operating at its potential once the cyclical
effects of economic shocks have abated. This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation
objective, determines the longer-run level of the nominal federal funds rate and other
interest rates in the staff’s projection and economic models. rLR is also a parameter in
9 From 2020 onward, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes
above and sometimes below the corresponding values observed in the case of equal weights.

many of the simple policy rules, including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in
this and other sections of Tealbook A.
In the special exhibit, we provide an overview of recent evidence on rLR based on
time-series studies from the research literature and the uncertainty around those
estimates. For comparison, we also show several survey-based estimates.10 To
summarize the main findings, rLR seems to have been declining since well before the
Global Financial Crisis and is currently likely at a historically low level, although there is
substantial uncertainty regarding its precise level.
• The top panel plots the range of point estimates from eight time-series models
of rLR . 11 Although the modeling approaches and econometric techniques
differ across the various models, the studies have the common feature that
they use time-series methods to infer rLR from the co-movement of either
macroeconomic series like inflation, interest rates, and output, or both
macroeconomic and financial markets data, like TIPS yields. The most recent
point estimates range from negative ¼ to positive 1¾ percent. All the point
estimates used to compute the range have declined since the early 2000s.12
• Time-series estimates of rLR are subject to sizable uncertainty. As depicted in
the middle panel, the 68 percent uncertainty bands range from ±½ percentage
point in the case of Del Negro and others (2017) to ±2½ percentage points in
the case of Laubach and Williams (2003). The sources of this uncertainty
vary across the studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of the
econometric approach as well as uncertainty about the prevailing state of the
economy and parameters of the model.
10 See the appendix to this section for sources, concepts, and methodology. This special exhibit
complements the evidence presented for a small number of time-series estimates in the boxes “The
Equilibrium Real Rate in the Longer Run” presented in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the July
2017 and January 2016 Tealbooks.
11 All time-series estimates reported herein have been computed using data updated through
2017:Q2.
12 There are differences in the paths of rLR across the studies. In particular, while some of the
paths (such as Laubach and Williams, 2003) hint at the possibility that the recent recession played a key
role in the decline of the equilibrium rate, others (such as Johannsen and Mertens, 2016, and Christensen
and Rudebusch, 2017) entail a slow decline—a pattern more consistent with the importance of secular
factors such as changes in demographics or a productivity growth slowdown. The role of demographics is
considered by Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido (2016).

• The bottom panel reports estimates of rLR from various sources: the Tealbook,
the SEP, the Survey of Primary Dealers, Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, and
the Congressional Budget Office. The Tealbook estimate, at ½ percent, is
similar to, though a touch lower than, the others.13 However, the evidence
presented in this special exhibit, taken as a whole, indicates that the staff’s
current assumption for rLR is consistent with time-series and survey estimates,
especially once account is taken of the fact that all these estimates are subject
to considerable uncertainty.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.
13 The staff, FOMC participants, and other forecasters have lowered their estimates of rLR in recent
years. For example, at the beginning of 2012, both the Tealbook baseline estimate and the median SEP
estimate stood at 2¼ percent.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined
as the difference between nominal income, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of the
level of nominal GDP, and a target value, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q∗4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently,
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of
s potential GDP. These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the

inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2

example, Erceg and others (2012).
3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.

do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines: a
Tealbook-consistent baseline and another one consistent with the Summary of Economic
Projections (SEP). The laboratory for simulations is the FRB/US model, the staff’s large-scale
econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate that, if
maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap
equal to zero in the final quarter of that period using the output projection consistent with the
Tealbook baseline or SEP-consistent baseline.4 This measure depends on a broad array of
economic factors, some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous
variables. The measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-
based expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of
future variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The top panel of the special exhibit shows a range of estimates from eight time-series
models based on the following studies: Christensen and Rudebusch (2017); Del Negro,
Giannone, Giannoni, and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen
and Mertens (2016); Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande
(2017); and Lubik and Matthes (2015). All computations use the latest vintage of historical data
through 2017:Q2. The estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point in time, they
make use of historical data only up to that point in time.
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each
model’s point estimate for 2017:Q2. The computation and interpretation of these bands are
specific to each study.

federal funds rate in the longer run.
• “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC members’ projections of the federal funds
rate in the longer run less the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the
