Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

The spending and labor market indicators that we have received since the April D
n
Tealbook show resource utilization as having continued to tighten thus far this year. The o
c
E
unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in May, down 0.4 percentage point from the end of c
ti
s
last year. In addition, the payroll employment gain through May exceeded the pace that e
m
we think is consistent with no change in labor utilization. Meanwhile, the incoming data o
D
on spending and production suggest that real GDP growth will rebound from an annual
rate of 1¼ percent in the first quarter to 2½ percent this quarter. On average, the pace of
growth over the first half of the year is about ½ percentage point faster than our estimate
of potential GDP growth.
Although the case seems strong that utilization has been tightening, it is a closer
call as to whether that tightening has proceeded more quickly than we expected in the
April Tealbook. On the one hand, the unemployment rate in May was 0.2 percentage
point lower than in our previous forecast, while the projected level of real GDP in the
second quarter is a touch higher. On the other hand, the recent pace of payroll
employment growth has been weaker than we had anticipated. Moreover, recent monthly
readings on PCE price inflation have been soft.
In particular, the April reading on PCE price inflation surprised us slightly to the
downside, as we had expected a larger bounceback following the very low March value.
Total PCE prices rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through April, while core prices rose
1.5 percent, 0.1 percentage point softer than expected in the previous Tealbook. We
continue to view the recent soft readings as importantly reflecting idiosyncratic and
transitory factors and, therefore, as telling us relatively little about the degree of tightness
in the real economy. On balance, in light of the lower unemployment rate and slightly
higher level of real GDP, we judge that resource utilization in the second quarter is a little
tighter than we had thought in April.
We now project that real GDP growth over 2017 as a whole will average almost
2½ percent, ¼ percentage point above the April Tealbook forecast. GDP growth is
forecast to slow to 2¼ percent in 2018 and to 1¾ percent in 2019, as the stimulus from
the fiscal expansion that we continue to assume will occur is offset by the ongoing

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&

e
v The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is above the projections from both the
e
D
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017
n
o and below the Blue Chip consensus in 2018. The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is
c
E
lower than both outside forecasts. The staff’s projection for CPI inflation is below
c
ti
those of outside forecasters in 2017 and is the same as them in 2018. The staff’s
s
e
m projections for both overall and core PCE price inflation are noticeably below the SPF
o
forecasts in 2017 but are in line with the SPF forecasts in 2018.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
e
D
the March FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic
n
o projection with the one we presented in the March Tealbook.
c
E
c
ti
Since March, we have revised up our projection for the increase in real GDP in 2017 by about
s
e
m ½ percentage point. Our forecast for real GDP growth in 2018 and 2019 is unrevised. With
o faster GDP growth, on net, over the projection period, the unemployment rate falls by more
D
than in the March forecast and reaches 3.8 percent at the end of 2019, which is
1.1 percentage points below the staff’s downwardly revised estimate of the longer‐ run
natural rate.
The available data on consumer price inflation for March and April were weak, but we view
these readings as importantly reflecting idiosyncratic and transitory factors. As a result, the
forecast for core PCE price inflation is marked down this year but is unrevised thereafter.
Total PCE inflation is expected to move up modestly over the next couple of years and to
reach 2 percent in 2019, 0.1 percentage point higher than in the March forecast.
With the outlook for the GDP gap somewhat tighter, the federal funds rate path from the
intercept ‐adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline forecast is above
that in the March Tealbook through most of the projection period.

gradual normalization of monetary policy.1 With real GDP growth expected to outpace t l
u
O
our estimate of potential output growth throughout the medium term, real economic
&
activity further overshoots its sustainable level. As a result, the unemployment rate is e l
v
e
projected to be 3.8 percent at the end of 2019, 1.1 percentage points below our estimate D
n
of its natural rate, and 0.2 percentage point lower than in the April Tealbook. We now o
c
E
project that the 12-month change in both total and core PCE price inflation will run a c
ti
s
little lower through the end of this year than in our previous projection. Beyond this year, e
m
though, our inflation forecast is not materially different from the April Tealbook and o
D
reaches 2 percent in 2019.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Fiscal Policy
 We have retained our placeholder assumption that adjustments to federal
fiscal policy will increase the primary budget deficit (that is, the deficit
excluding interest costs) by 1 percent of GDP, and that this fiscal expansion
will take the form of a cut in personal income taxes starting in the first quarter
of 2018. But there continues to be considerable uncertainty about the
potential size, timing, and composition of any fiscal policy changes—indeed,
probably more so than earlier this year.
o In preparing the current forecast we contemplated delaying the onset or
reducing the magnitude of the assumed fiscal expansion. Although we see
lower odds of something equivalent to our assumed policy change being
enacted, we still view it to be the modal outcome.
 We continue to project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of
government will increase the rate of real GDP growth about ¼ percentage
point in 2017, ½ percentage point in 2018, and ¼ percentage point in 2019.
Monetary Policy
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection
calls for the federal funds rate to increase a little more than 1 percentage point
per year, on average, over the projection period and to average 3.7 percent in
1 The assumed placeholder for fiscal expansion adds about ¼ percentage point to the growth rate
of real GDP in both 2018 and 2019.

 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly over the medium
term from an average of 2.3 percent in the current quarter to 4.0 percent by the
end of 2019. In line with the slightly steeper trajectory for the federal funds
rate, the yield at the end of 2019 is a bit higher than in our April forecast and
modestly above its assumed longer-run value of 3.5 percent.
 The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was revised mostly in line with the
path for the 10-year Treasury yield. However, we lowered our projection for
the triple-B corporate bond spread by 5 to 10 basis points in both 2017 and
2018 in response to the persistently lower-than-projected spread over the past
few quarters.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices have risen about 3¾ percent since the April Tealbook, whereas
we had projected stock prices to be about flat. Nevertheless, in our view,
notable valuation pressures will limit the scope for further stock price
appreciation over the medium term. Accordingly, equity prices are projected
to rise at an average annual rate of only ½ percent from here forward, a tad
less than in the April Tealbook. (For a discussion of the rationale behind the
staff’s forecast of equity prices, see the box “Stock Market Trajectory in the
Baseline Forecast.”)
 Incoming data on house prices have been slightly stronger than expected, and
we have nudged up our forecast for house price appreciation this year to
around 6 percent. We judge that the ratio of house prices to rents is
marginally above its long-run trend. To reflect this consideration, we project
the growth in home values to slow to around 4 percent in 2018 and 2019, a
pace that would stabilize house prices relative to rents.

Stock Market Trajectory in the Baseline Forecast
&
l
e
v The most recent QS report highlighted valuation pressures across a range of
e
D
assets, including U.S. equities, where price-to-earnings ratios have reached
n
o extraordinarily high levels not seen since the bursting of the tech stock bubble in
c
E
the early 2000s. Valuation of equities relative to government bonds, as gauged
c
ti
by the staff’s estimate of the expected equity premium, is also higher than
s
e
m average (that is, the equity premium is low), although not near historical
o
extremes. Moreover, in recent Tealbooks we have been projecting that the
D
equity premium (the shaded area in figure 1) will further narrow toward
historically low levels on the expectation that equity prices will remain resilient
even as interest rates increase. In light of these valuation concerns, we
contemplated adopting a new baseline stock market path in which stock prices
would decline 5 to 10 percent by the end of 2018 relative to their current level.
Notwithstanding the valuation pressures noted previously, we decided against
such a change for the following reasons.
Importantly, the recent forecasts already had stock prices rising at a historically
very slow pace, about 1 percent per year in nominal terms. Including dividends,
this pace would imply annual returns on stocks of about 3 percent. This return is
well below average historical equity returns and reflects the staff’s view that
currently elevated valuation pressures are likely to weigh heavily on equity
returns in the medium term.
Standard asset pricing models imply that investors must be expecting to earn
some, even if small, premium on stocks over a two-year period relative to the
risk-free (nominal) return on a two-year Treasury bond. To rationalize a decline in
stock prices over the next two years, we would have to adopt one of two
arguments, neither of which we currently find very compelling.
The first possible argument would be that the Tealbook forecast and narrative
embed a substantial negative surprise to markets and investors, such as
disappointing (after-tax) corporate earnings, increased downside risk to
economic conditions, or higher-than-expected interest rates. But the baseline
forecast anticipates steady, gradual strengthening of the economy over the next
two years without a serious inflation threat. Moreover, the rise in long-term
Treasury yields embedded in the baseline is not far out of line with market
expectations. All of this suggests the staff forecast is broadly consistent with key
dimensions of the market’s outlook; accordingly, if the staff forecast were to be
realized, we do not think that equity investors would be disappointed.
The second possible argument for a stock market decline is an assumption that
investors will reassess their exposure to equities in light of continued prevailing
high valuations—in effect, an increase in risk aversion triggered by something
outside of the staff forecast. With regard to this rationalization, the vast

k
o
o
l
t
u
literature on forecasting stock returns does offer evidence that there is some O
predictive content of stock valuation measures for subsequent returns, though &
such tests have less predictive power out of sample.1 Most predictive e l
v
regressions, however, would suggest low positive, rather than negative, e
D
expected returns. An alternative approach involves estimating the probability of n
o
a stock market crash or substandard returns. Here, again, recent research and c
E
preliminary staff analysis tend to suggest that current stock market valuations c
ti
would, at best, predicate a fairly modest increase in the odds of substandard e s
m
future returns, with wide confidence bands.2
o
D
Finally, although valuation ratios and equity premium measures do not enable us
to predict the timing and extent of stock market corrections with much
confidence, these variables are useful in assessing the financial system’s
vulnerability to negative shocks. Thus, for now at least, we think it is preferable
to signal our concerns regarding valuation pressures through the use of
alternative scenarios rather than adjustments to the baseline forecast.

t l Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
u
O
&  Foreign real GDP growth picked up to 3¼ percent in the first quarter, a bit
l
e more than we anticipated in the April Tealbook. We expect growth abroad to
v
e
D moderate to a 2½ percent pace by early next year, in part as Canada’s growth
n
o
c settles to a more sustainable rate and policy stimulus in China diminishes. As
E
c in the April Tealbook, we expect foreign growth to remain at this near-
ti
s
e potential pace through the medium term.
m
o
D
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 1¼ percent since the time of
the April Tealbook. We expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at about a
2 percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market expectations for
the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast, leaving the level of
the dollar at the end of 2019 about ¾ percent lower than in the April
Tealbook. The slightly greater pace of dollar appreciation in this projection
reflects the marginally more restrictive stance of U.S. monetary policy in
response to the slightly tighter economy.
Oil and Commodity Prices
 Against a backdrop of continued increases in U.S. oil production, oil prices
fluctuated over the intermeeting period on changing market convictions about
OPEC’s agreement to cut production. Ultimately, OPEC renewed the
agreement for an additional nine months, but the agreement did not include
additional production cuts that some market participants had expected. The
spot price of Brent crude oil closed most recently at $51 per barrel, $2 per
barrel lower than at the time of the April Tealbook. As in the April Tealbook,
we project that oil prices will decline gradually over the projection period.
 Agricultural prices have risen 2 percent since the April Tealbook, mainly on
increased wheat and corn prices. Cool weather and heavy rains in the
Midwest have delayed planting schedules and pose some risk for the winter
harvest.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
On balance, the incoming spending data have surprised us to the upside relative to
our expectations in the April Tealbook. We currently estimate that real GDP increased at
an annual rate of 1¼ percent in the first quarter, and we project GDP growth to step up to
Page 10 of 130

--- Page 14 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 2, 2017
k
o
o
about a 2½ percent pace in the second and third quarters, largely reflecting a pickup in t l
u
O
consumption spending from its transitorily low first-quarter pace. On net, our projection
&
for GDP growth in the first half is revised up a couple tenths of a percentage point from e l
v
e
the previous Tealbook, mainly due to upward revisions in E&I spending and net exports. D
n
o
c
E
 We estimate that real PCE posted a meager increase of ½ percent at an annual
c
ti
rate during the first quarter. We continue to attribute the weakness to a s
e
m
variety of special factors, including depressed outlays for energy services due o
D
to unseasonably warm weather, a step-down in motor vehicle sales from an
above-trend pace last year, and some payback from strong gains in non-energy
services in the fourth quarter. The incoming spending data have corroborated
our view that PCE growth will pick up during the second quarter, although we
tempered our near-term forecast in light of the sharp downward revision to
real disposable personal income in the fourth quarter of last year.2 Even so,
with ongoing gains in employment and still-upbeat levels of sentiment, we
expect real PCE growth to average about 3 percent this quarter and next.
 Investment in E&I is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 7 percent
in the first quarter, well above our April Tealbook forecast of 2½ percent
growth. In addition, indicators of business spending in the second quarter
remain upbeat. Investment in E&I is now projected to rise at nearly a
5 percent pace during the first half of this year, twice as fast as in the April
Tealbook, and we expect a similar increase in the third quarter.
 We estimate that residential investment rose at a robust 14 percent annual rate
in the first quarter, noticeably stronger than in the April Tealbook. Some of
that strength was likely pulled forward in response to unseasonably warm
weather, the anticipation of higher interest rates, or both. We expect that the
2 Incorporating information from unemployment insurance tax records led the BEA to revise down
their estimate of labor compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016 by $114 billion. Anecdotal reports
suggest that the weak fourth-quarter reading could partly reflect a shifting of income from late last year into
early this year in anticipation of a potential cut in personal tax rates; such a shift would imply a sharp
increase in compensation in the first quarter. Indeed, the opposite pattern occurred in late 2012 and early
2013, when compensation was pulled forward noticeably in advance of the 2013 expiration of the Bush tax
cuts. For now, we have tentatively taken on board the lower level of income: The BEA has not assumed a
first-quarter rebound in compensation, and we have not overridden their assumption in our projection.
(This question could be resolved in the summer when the unemployment insurance tax records for the first
quarter are incorporated in the national accounts.)

quarters. However, the incoming data on investment in other nonresidential
structures have been weaker than we expected. All told, our forecast for
nonresidential structures investment in the first half of this year is unrevised
from the April Tealbook, while the third quarter is somewhat stronger.
 The contribution of net exports to real GDP growth is ½ percentage point
stronger in the first quarter, reflecting both lower-than-expected imports and
higher-than-expected exports. We have also revised up the net export
contribution in the second and third quarters by about 0.1 percentage point in
response to the recent dollar depreciation. Net exports are now projected to be
neutral for first-half GDP growth and a modest drag in the third quarter.
 On balance, the incoming data on industrial production have been somewhat
stronger than we had anticipated in the April Tealbook. We expect increases
in industrial production to moderate in the coming months, as utilities
production is held down by a return to seasonally normal temperatures and
manufacturing production is restrained by a slowdown in motor vehicle
assemblies. Mining output has risen at a rapid clip in recent months, largely
as a result of gains in oil and gas drilling and crude oil production. (For a
discussion of U.S. crude oil production, see the box “Why Is U.S. Oil Output
So Strong?”)
All told, real GDP is projected to rise nearly 2½ percent this year, ¼ percentage
point faster than in the April Tealbook. Beyond 2017, our GDP growth forecast is
unrevised at 2¼ percent in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019; toward the end of the medium
term, growth slows because of the ongoing gradual normalization of monetary policy.
 The key conditioning factors underpinning our forecast are more
accommodative, on balance, than in the April Tealbook—in particular, the

Why Is U.S. Oil Output So Strong?
l
e
v
e
D Total U.S. crude oil production nearly doubled from around 5 million barrels per day (b/d) in the
n
o mid‐2000s to just under 9½ million b/d in 2015 (figure 1, black line). This increase was almost
c
E exclusively due to production from unconventional “tight oil” geographies, where methods such
c
ti as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have been exploited to extract oil and gas trapped
s
e
m in low‐permeability rock formations. However, between 2014 and 2016, oil prices fell about
o 70 percent, and the count of drilling rigs in operation—a widely used predictor of near‐term crude
D
oil production—plummeted by a similar magnitude. To the surprise of many industry analysts,
total U.S. production fell only 6 percent and has turned up in recent quarters.
Why did oil production not fall by more? The answer lies in the large and widespread productivity
gains in drilling and extraction technologies not reflected in some existing indicators of
production. These gains in productivity imply that (1) a simple count of drilling rigs is, by itself, no
longer a good predictor of near‐term production, and (2) U.S. producers are able to remain
profitable at far lower prices than in previous years. Thus, even with the expected path of oil
prices below $60 per barrel and the number of active drilling rigs far lower than a few years ago,
the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects U.S. oil production to average 9.3 million
b/d in 2017 and to reach an all‐time annual record of 10.0 million b/d in 2018 (figure 1, black dotted
line). Understanding the factors behind the EIA’s projected growth in oil production is important,
as these estimates are incorporated into the Board staff’s forecasts for real GDP and industrial
production.1
Mapping Rig Counts to Output. Traditionally, the rig count has been seen as a good indicator of
near‐term production because a large fraction of a well’s output occurs in its first few months.
However, the linkage between drilling rigs and oil extraction relies on the assumption that the
productivity of successive cohorts of new wells is relatively stable. Since the onset of the tight‐oil
boom in 2010, the first‐month output of new wells advanced rapidly, with a new well in the tight‐
oil areas producing roughly 700 b/d in early 2017, more than four times the 2010 level (figure 2).
1 Oil output is not a direct input into the spending‐side calculation of GDP, but as domestic oil production
rises, oil imports—which are subtracted from aggregate expenditures to measure GDP—decline. Thus, a shift
toward domestically sourced oil boosts the level of real GDP.

Drawing on new EIA data for the main tight‐oil regions, the staff have constructed a new O
measure—the number of rigs needed for flat production (RNFP)—that helps gauge the direction &
l
and magnitude of expected changes in domestic oil production. The RNFP uses estimates of the e
v
productivity of new wells to calculate the number of rigs required to keep total production e
D
constant in the tight‐oil regions—that is, to exactly offset the natural decline in output from n
o
existing wells.2 With conventional oil production roughly flat over the past decade—see figure 1, c
E
orange line—the RNFP and the tight‐oil rig count can be used to predict changes in aggregate c
ti
production. Figure 3 shows the RNFP (black line) and the tight‐oil rig count (red line). With the e s
m
number of rigs now trending above the RNFP, total oil production should continue to expand in
o
the coming months, consistent with the EIA projection embedded in the staff forecast. D
Breakeven Prices. The oil price required for a new drilling project to be economically viable has
declined notably. The downward trend in those prices, known as breakeven prices, also supports
the strong production forecast. Breakeven prices in the tight‐oil areas have been falling over the
past two years while also converging across regions toward more similar levels (figure 4). 3 While
part of the decline likely reflects input costs for drilling that fell during the industry downturn (for
example, rig rental rates, sand, and labor), structural changes—such as innovations in drilling and
new well completion techniques—account for a substantial portion of the reduction. In April
2017, average breakevens were a little below spot oil prices, as shown by the black line in figure 4;
however, average numbers hide a large degree of heterogeneity, even within regions.4
Looking Forward. Large productivity gains in recent years have altered historical relationships,
making new indicators helpful in understanding current and future trends. Further production
gains may face some headwinds in future months, as input costs are likely to increase with more
drilling rigs returning to use, but new technologies also have considerable scope to spread across
existing producers. Hence, current projections for near‐record production levels of U.S. crude oil
in 2017 and 2018 appear consistent with a path of moderate oil prices and modest levels of rigs in
operation.
2 Rising production puts upward pressure on future values of the RNFP, but productivity gains counteract
this effect, reducing the number of rigs needed to maintain a given level of output.
3 Definitions of breakeven prices vary widely. We report wellhead half‐cycle breakevens, a measure of well
profitability that excludes transportation expenses, the cost of exploration, and other field developments.
4 Within‐region breakevens range from about $30 per barrel in some areas of the Permian Basin to $70 per
barrel in some counties within the Bakken region.

D to 1¾ percent in 2019; the level of potential at the end of 2019 is 0.1 percent
higher than in our April forecast because of stronger projected capital
spending. With real GDP growth projected to outpace potential growth over
the medium term, resource utilization tightens further: Real GDP is expected
to exceed its potential level by 2 percent at the end of 2019, ¼ percentage
point more than in the April Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
Taken together, the April and May employment reports indicate that the labor
market has tightened further.
 The unemployment rate declined from 4.5 percent in March to 4.3 percent in
May, 0.2 percentage point lower than we projected in the April Tealbook,
while the labor force participation rate (LFPR) declined from 63.0 percent in
March to 62.7 percent in May, 0.1 percentage point below our expectation.
We now project the unemployment rate to remain at 4.3 percent through
September, 0.2 percentage point lower than in our previous forecast.
 Payroll employment rose 174,000 in April and 138,000 in May, somewhat
slower than we expected in the April Tealbook. Employers have added an
average of 160,000 payroll jobs per month so far this year, about 20,000 per
month slower than in the April Tealbook but still faster than the pace we
estimate to be consistent with unchanged labor market slack
(90,000 to 120,000 per month). Balancing the weaker-than-expected
employment readings against the upward revisions to our near-term forecast
for GDP growth, we project payroll gains to average about 170,000 per month
through September, little changed from our April forecast.

and the LFPR is 0.1 percentage point above its estimated trend.3
Looking ahead, the labor market is projected to tighten further over the medium
term and to be very tight by the end of 2019.
 After decreasing about 1 percentage point since early 2015, the
unemployment rate is projected to decline another 0.5 percentage point over
the medium term and to end 2019 at 3.8 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower
than in the April Tealbook.
 Average monthly total payroll gains are expected to slow from 166,000 in
2017 to 122,000 in 2019. Both the LFPR and the employment-to-population
ratio are projected to continue to improve relative to their declining trends.
 We project that productivity will increase slightly less than 1 percent per year,
on average, over the forecast period, a bit slower than in 2016 (though still up
from its average over the preceding several years) and slightly below our
estimate of its structural pace.4
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Core PCE price inflation picked up in April from the exceptionally low March
reading, but the pickup was smaller than we had projected. Our best judgment is that the
3 We considered revising down our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment in this projection
in light of the further decline in unemployment and the weak recent readings on inflation. For the moment,
however, we have chosen not to make any adjustment, in large part because we view those weak inflation
readings to be transitory.
4 Productivity typically falls below its structural level when the labor market becomes tight,
possibly because a larger share of workers hired in a tight labor market have below-average productivity
than is the case during a slack labor market.

Both readings were slightly lower than we projected in the previous Tealbook. o
D
o Much of the softness in core PCE prices in March and April can be
explained by sharp declines in prices for wireless telephone services and
prescription drugs; we think that these declines have limited signal value
for monthly inflation readings going forward.
o That said, a number of categories of consumer prices registered weak
readings in March; indeed, the trimmed mean PCE price index also slowed
that month, though not by as much as the core index.
o In addition, first-quarter core import prices were weaker than expected, a
factor that we think is modestly restraining core PCE inflation in the
current quarter. We have revised up our projected path for core import
price inflation over the rest of the year in response to the dollar’s recent
depreciation.
 For the second quarter, these various factors led us to mark down our forecast
for core PCE inflation to 1.1 percent, 0.5 percentage point below our April
Tealbook projection. Core inflation is projected to step up to 1.8 percent in
the third quarter, 0.1 percentage point faster than in the April Tealbook,
reflecting the higher projected path for core goods import price inflation.
 Measured on a 12-month change basis, core PCE prices moved down to
1.5 percent in April, rounding 0.1 percentage point lower than in our previous
forecast. We expect the 12-month change in both total and core PCE inflation
to remain at around 1½ percent until this year’s low March reading drops out
of the calculation.

 Core import price inflation is expected to step up from a ½ percent pace in the t l
u
O
first quarter to 2¼ percent in the second and third quarters, as the drag from
&
earlier dollar appreciation is replaced by a boost from recent dollar e l
v
e
depreciation. Thereafter, import price inflation is expected to slow to a D
n
½ percent pace, consistent with moderate foreign inflation, a gradually o
c
E
appreciating dollar, and slowly declining commodity prices. c
ti
s
e
m
 The incoming data on longer-run inflation expectations are little changed, on
o
D
balance, since the April Tealbook. Median expectations over the next 5 to
10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers held at
2.4 percent in May, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ median
10-year inflation expectations for PCE prices remained stable at 2.1 percent in
the second quarter. Longer-term TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation edged lower in May. The median of inflation expectations
3 years ahead reported in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of
Consumer Expectations increasing from 2.7 percent in March to 2.9 percent
in April.
We continue to see PCE price inflation converging to 2 percent by the end of the
medium term.
 We now project core PCE prices to rise 1.6 percent in 2017, 0.1 percentage
point lower than in the April Tealbook, and then to move up to 2.0 percent by
2019. Total PCE price inflation is also expected to move up from 1.6 percent
this year to 2.0 percent in 2019. Our forecasts for core inflation in 2018 and
2019 are unrevised to rounding relative to April, while our forecast for total
inflation is up 0.1 percentage point in both years.
 The ¼ percentage point increase in core inflation between 2016 and 2019 is
driven by the diminishing pass-through from earlier declines in energy prices
and core import prices, along with the further tightening of resource
utilization. We also continue to assume a small pickup (5 basis points in both
2018 and 2019) in the prevailing level of inflation expectations relevant for
price and wage setting.

t l Incoming data on labor compensation have been mixed. We continue to expect
u
O
compensation growth to pick up over the medium term as the labor market tightens
&
e l further.
v
e
D
n
o  After increasing at a pace of about 2 percent in the second half of last year, the
c
E
ECI for private workers rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the three
c
ti
s months ending in March, somewhat more than we expected. The pickup was
e
m
o particularly pronounced in occupation groups and industries that tend to be
D
more affected by minimum wages, which had increased in several states in
January; we expect ECI growth to step down to about a 2¼ percent pace over
the rest of the year. Over the 12 months ending in March, the ECI increased
2.3 percent, up from 1.8 percent over the preceding 12 months.
 Average hourly earnings (AHE) increased 2.5 percent over the 12 months
ending in May, unchanged from the preceding 12 months. With AHE now
having come in below our expectations in four of the first five months of this
year, we marked down our near-term forecast modestly. We now anticipate
this 12-month change will move roughly sideways at around 2½ percent
through September, nearly ½ percentage point lower than our previous
forecast.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3.5 percent
in April, below its recent highs but noticeably above the pace seen a few
years ago.
 Incorporating the BEA’s large downward revision to compensation in the
fourth quarter of last year, we now estimate that compensation per hour in the
business sector fell 2.1 percent at an annual rate in that quarter and rose only
1.6 percent in 2016. Although the BEA’s estimates for the first quarter, which
are still based on incomplete source data, imply that hourly compensation rose
at a 1.7 percent annual rate, we see upside risk to this estimate. The very
weak fourth-quarter growth in compensation per hour may be partly due to the
shifting of compensation that we discussed in footnote 2; if so, when the more
complete source data are available, this series could eventually show a sharper
rebound in the first quarter than currently estimated. In any event, we
continue to project that this measure of compensation growth will pick up

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK e
D
n
o
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be c
E
c
4.9 percent in the longer run, and that the growth rate of potential GDP will be ti
s
e
1.7 percent. m
o
D
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by the first half of 2022.
 Real GDP growth slows to about 1½ percent in 2020 and 1¼ percent in 2021
as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level. The unemployment rate is
4.0 percent in 2020 and continues to rise gradually toward its assumed natural
rate in subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up from 2.0 percent in 2019 and hovers slightly
above the Committee’s long-run objective for several years before moving
back to 2 percent.
 With output above its potential level and inflation a bit over the Committee’s
2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about 1¼ percentage
points above its long-run value of 3 percent in 2021 and then moves back
toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
We estimate that total foreign growth picked up to 3¼ percent at an annual rate in
the first quarter from 2¾ percent in the fourth. Foreign economies have now registered
their third consecutive quarter of above-trend growth following lackluster performance in
the first half of last year. Incoming data have continued to surprise us on the upside, and
our estimate of first-quarter growth abroad is ¼ percentage point higher than in the April
Tealbook. The revisions have been widespread, with sizable markups in Canada, Japan,
and Mexico, although the United Kingdom—where growth tumbled to below 1 percent—
k
is a major exception. o
o
l
t
u
O
We see foreign growth moderating to its potential rate of 2½ percent by early next
&
year and staying at about that pace for the remainder of the forecast period. The e l
v
e
projected deceleration in foreign activity reflects the waning of forces that led to the D
n
earlier strong growth, with the expansion in Canada and Japan moving down to a more o
c
E
sustainable pace, credit stimulus in China diminishing, commodity prices leveling off
l
’
t
n
from their increases over the past year, and the recent sharp rebound in global trade I
showing some signs of slowing. That said, in response to strong activity data in the
foreign economies, we have revised up foreign growth slightly for the remainder of 2017,
with the forecast unchanged thereafter.
Risks surrounding our foreign outlook appear to be more balanced than last year.
On the upside, the strength of recent activity indicators from abroad—and the pattern of
upward revisions to our foreign outlook over the past few Tealbooks—could foreshadow
stronger momentum in the foreign economies than what we currently expect. We explore
the consequences of such an outcome in the “Stronger Foreign Growth” alternative
scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
On the downside, we remain concerned about economic and financial prospects
for the euro area, especially in Italy, despite a decline in near-term risks following the
French election. Moreover, in China, stepped-up efforts to rein in credit growth, while
positive for longer-term financial stability, raise the risk of a sharp escalation of financial
stress in the near term. In addition, we remain mindful of the possibility that monetary
policy normalization in the United States could disrupt emerging market economies
(EMEs). Such a risk would be heightened were developments in the U.S. economy, such
as unexpectedly high inflation, to require faster tightening of monetary policy, a situation
Page 39 of 130

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 2, 2017
we explore in the “EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario in the
Risks and Uncertainty section.
Recent data suggest that inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) will
moderate to just above 1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from 2.3 percent
in the first as the effects of higher energy prices fade. AFE inflation should gradually
pick up to 1½ percent over the forecast period, although this pickup masks divergent
trends. In the euro area and Japan, inflation moves up in response to tighter resource
pressures but remains considerably below central banks’ targets; as such, we assume that
monetary policy in these regions will remain highly accommodative. In Canada, inflation
k
o stays close to the 2 percent target, while in the United Kingdom it falls toward 2 percent
o
l
u t as the pass-through from earlier currency depreciation fades; in both economies, we
O
& project that monetary authorities will start removing stimulus next year.
l
e
v
e
D We estimate that inflation in the EMEs will come in at about 3½ percent this
n
o quarter, unchanged from the first quarter. Thereafter, we see inflation declining to a little
c
E
l over 3 percent by the end of this year and stabilizing at that pace. The decline in inflation
’
t
n
I largely reflects a deceleration of prices in Mexico as the effects of earlier currency
depreciation and gasoline price hikes wane. We have seen diverse movements in
monetary policy among the EMEs, concentrated in Latin America: The central banks of
Mexico and Argentina recently hiked their policy rates, while the central banks of Brazil,
Chile, and Colombia eased.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Canada. Real GDP growth climbed to 3.7 percent in the first quarter from
2.7 percent in the fourth, ¾ percentage point higher than our April Tealbook estimate.
This step-up in growth was driven by unusually strong consumption, reflecting the
recent introduction of the Canada Child Benefit program, and by the resumption of
investment in the energy sector. Recent indicators, such as the April manufacturing
PMI, suggest that growth will moderate to about 2½ percent in the current quarter.
We expect that growth, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies,
will average around 2 percent through mid-2018 and settle at its potential pace of
1¾ percent thereafter.
• Japan. Real GDP growth picked up from 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter to
2.2 percent in the first, almost 1 percentage point faster than estimated in the April
Page 40 of 130

--- Page 44 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 2, 2017
Tealbook. This acceleration was driven by a pickup in household spending and a
large swing in inventory investment. Recent indicators, including April industrial
production and the May manufacturing PMI, suggest that economic activity has
continued to expand at a solid pace. Accordingly, we now project GDP growth to
average almost 1½ percent over the remainder of this year, up a bit from our April
forecast and well above our estimate of potential growth of ½ percent. Thereafter,
growth should move down further to ¾ percent in 2018 before stalling in 2019 as a
result of a legislated consumption tax hike. Given continued monetary stimulus
throughout the forecast period and the projected opening of a significant positive
output gap, we forecast that inflation will rise from about zero in early 2017 to
k
o
1¼ percent in 2019 (excluding the effects of the tax hike), still well below the o
l
t
2 percent target. u
O
&
l
• Euro Area. Real GDP growth held steady at 2 percent in the first quarter. Recent e
v
e
indicators—such as PMIs and confidence readings through May—have been D
n
o
relatively strong, consistent with growth rising to 2¼ percent in the current quarter.
c
E
We project that growth will edge down to 1¾ percent in 2018 and 2019. Compared ’ l
t
n
with the April Tealbook, this forecast is ¼ percentage point stronger for 2017, I
reflecting the strength of recent data, but is unchanged thereafter.
Data through May suggest that inflation will step down from 2.9 percent in the first
quarter to ½ percent in the current quarter entirely as a result of a decline in food and
energy prices. Headline inflation should rise to 1¼ percent in late 2017 as food and
energy prices recover, and edge up further to 1½ percent by 2019 as resource slack is
slowly absorbed. We continue to assume that the European Central Bank will
purchase assets at its current monthly pace of €60 billion through the end of 2017
before tapering in the first half of 2018. In addition, we anticipate that the deposit
rate will remain at negative 0.4 percent until early 2019 before rising to 0 percent by
the end of the forecast period.
• United Kingdom. In contrast to most foreign economies, U.K. GDP growth plunged
from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter to 0.7 percent in the first quarter, 1¼ percentage
points below our April Tealbook projection. This slowdown is due to a decline in
exports after a fourth-quarter surge and to weak private consumption reflecting the
moderation in real incomes caused by higher inflation. Recent indicators, such as
April retail sales and PMIs through May, suggest GDP will rise 1½ percent in the
Page 41 of 130

--- Page 45 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 2, 2017
current quarter. Thereafter, growth should stay at about that pace through 2019, as
uncertainty surrounding Brexit weighs on household and business spending.
Inflation rose to 3.9 percent in the first quarter, and we expect it to moderate to
slightly above 3 percent this quarter as past sterling depreciation continues to pass
through to consumer prices. As this boost wanes, inflation should decline to near the
2 percent target by early 2018. With wage growth more subdued than previously
expected, we now anticipate that the Bank of England will raise its policy rate in the
fourth quarter of 2018, one quarter later than assumed in the April Tealbook.
k EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
o
o
l
t
u • Mexico. Worries that uncertainty about U.S. trade policy will weigh on the Mexican
O
& economy are abating somewhat. GDP growth edged down to 2.7 percent in the first
l
e
v quarter from 2.9 percent in the fourth but was still ¾ percentage point above what we
e
D
had in the April Tealbook. Growth was supported by stronger-than-expected exports
n
o
c and household demand against the backdrop of the lowest unemployment rate since
E
l
’
t 2007. Recent indicators—including weak manufacturing exports as well as the sales,
n
I
production, and exports of vehicles—suggest that growth will drop further to about
2 percent in the current quarter. But this projection is nonetheless ¼ percentage point
higher than in the April forecast, as U.S. manufacturing production looks stronger.
We expect Mexican growth to gradually move up to 2½ percent by the end of 2018.
Reduced drag from fiscal consolidation, a weaker peso, and past reforms in the
energy sector should support growth, but be offset by tightened monetary policy.
We see inflation declining to 6 percent in the current quarter from nearly double-digit
inflation in the first as the effects of past peso depreciation and a January hike in fuel
prices start to wane. Inflation should decline further to near the 3 percent inflation
target by 2018. Responding to inflationary pressures, the Bank of Mexico raised the
policy rate 25 basis points in mid-May to 6.75 percent, 375 basis points above its
level at the start of its tightening phase in late 2015. We expect more rate hikes later
this year.
• Brazil. GDP growth experienced a stunning turnaround from negative 2.2 percent in
the fourth quarter to 4.3 percent in the first. We had anticipated a substantial pickup,
but a surge in agricultural exports boosted growth 1¾ percentage points above our
April Tealbook estimate. As exports normalize, we see Brazilian growth moderating
Page 42 of 130

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 2, 2017
to ¾ percent in the current quarter before gradually picking up to about 2¼ percent by
2019. Lately, financial conditions in Brazil have tightened in the wake of a political
crisis that erupted in mid-May and threatens to topple the interim government of
President Michel Temer. These developments and the weaker incoming indicators
for the second quarter prompted us to mark down our near-term Brazilian outlook.
Over the longer term, our baseline forecast is unchanged and continues to assume that
the government will implement critical fiscal and structural reforms, but the recent
political turmoil has increased uncertainty about future progress toward these reforms
and about the economic outlook more generally.
k
Amid double-digit unemployment and tight monetary policy, inflation declined to o
o
l
4.1 percent in April on a 12-month basis, below the 4½ percent target. This decline, t
u
O
coupled with still-weak domestic demand, led the Brazilian central bank to slash its &
l
policy rate 100 basis points in mid-April and another 100 basis points in late May, to e
v
e
10.25 percent. We expect further cuts in the next few months. D
n
o
c
• China. After a strong first quarter, we estimate that real GDP growth will slow to E
l
’
t
6½ percent this quarter, slightly below our April Tealbook projection. Infrastructure n
I
and property-sector investment have held up, but PMIs, exports, commodity imports,
industrial production, and manufacturing investment all weakened in April. Some of
the moderation in domestic demand likely reflects diminishing credit stimulus, and
we expect growth to fall further over the coming quarters amid ongoing efforts by
Chinese authorities to tighten domestic financial conditions. All told, we see growth
stepping down to about 6¼ percent in the second half of this year and then slowing
further, in line with potential growth, to 5¾ percent by 2019. Downside risks to the
outlook remain, including the possibility of a sharp adjustment in the property market,
a run on the financial system, or renewed capital outflows leading to sharp moves in
the exchange rate.
Headline consumer price inflation fell to negative 0.6 percent in the first quarter on
falling food prices. We see inflation increasing to 2½ percent in the current quarter as
food price inflation stabilizes and staying about there over the forecast period.
• Other Emerging Asia. Strong export growth throughout much of the region, together
with a rebound in India as the negative effects of its demonetization policy abated,
boosted growth in other emerging Asia to 4.4 percent in the first quarter, from
3.5 percent in the fourth. We see the robust export growth that has supported the

region’s strong performance moderating some of late. Two important drivers of
Asian exports have been Chinese demand for the region’s products and strong
performance in the high-tech sector. Most recent indicators for regional exports,
Chinese imports, and high tech appear to have cooled somewhat. As such, we see
growth in other emerging Asia edging down over the next few quarters and settling at
around 3½ percent by early next year.

Financial Market Developments
Over the intermeeting period, prices of risky assets were little changed, on net,
while Treasury yields declined and the dollar depreciated modestly. Investors perceived
FOMC communications as broadly in line with expectations and incoming economic data
as slightly weaker than expected on balance. Confidence in the Administration’s ability
to advance its economic agenda appeared to wane somewhat further, while market
participants’ perceptions of an improved global economic outlook reportedly provided
some support to investor risk sentiment.
 FOMC communications were characterized as about in line with expectations,
with investors noting that the Committee did not seem to have materially
changed its view of the economic outlook. However, the May FOMC minutes
were generally seen as having provided a bit more clarity on the Committee’s
plan to reduce reinvestments this year.
 Based on a straight read of market quotes, the probability of a rate hike at the
June meeting increased, on net, from 65 percent to 90 percent, while the
implied risk-neutral probability of at least one more rate hike this year,
conditional on a rate hike in June, declined from 58 percent to 44 percent.

forward its economic and regulatory reforms. Near-term option-implied stock

spreads were little changed on net.

 Foreign market developments were generally positive, boosted by mildly
improved sentiment following the French election and foreign data that mostly
surprised on the upside. Globally, equity prices generally rose, most euro-area
sovereign bond spreads declined modestly, and capital flows to emerging
market economies (EMEs) continued. The notable exception was Brazil,
where local political developments weighed on domestic financial markets.
The broad dollar index declined about 1¼ percent, mainly driven by its
depreciation against AFE currencies.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as broadly in
line with investors’ expectations that the Committee would continue to remove policy
accommodation at a gradual pace. Market participants interpreted both the Committee’s
assessment in the May FOMC statement that the slowdown of growth in the first quarter
was “likely to be transitory” and the phrase in the May FOMC minutes that “most
participants viewed the recent softer inflation data as primarily reflecting transitory
factors” as indicating that the Committee had not materially changed its economic
outlook. In addition, market participants generally viewed the discussion in the minutes
on reducing reinvestments as mitigating the risk that the process of reducing the size of
the balance sheet would lead to outsized movements in interest rates or adverse effects on s

e
market functioning. Market reports also highlighted the minutes discussion noting that k

Fi
and the path of the federal funds rate evolved as currently expected. Partly in reaction to
the minutes, a number of market participants reportedly pulled forward their expectations
for the most likely timing of a change to the Committee’s reinvestment policy.
The probability of a rate hike occurring at the June meeting—as implied by a
straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts and without adjusting for term
premiums—rose to 90 percent from 65 percent prior to the May meeting, while the
implied probability of at least one more rate hike later this year, conditional on a rate hike
in June, declined from 58 percent to 44 percent. The expected path of the federal funds
rate from 2018 to the end of 2020, as implied by both a straight read from OIS quotes and

a staff model that adjusts for term premiums, declined a bit over the intermeeting period,
in part because of the release of the May employment situation report.
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened somewhat, on net, over the
intermeeting period, with the 2-year Treasury yield being little changed and the 10-year
yield declining 14 basis points. Following the May FOMC meeting, intermediate- and
longer-dated nominal Treasury yields moved up as market participants highlighted the
passage in the statement that the slowdown in growth during the first quarter was likely
to be transitory. Subsequently, those increases more than reversed in the remainder of the
intermeeting period, as yields declined in reaction to the weaker-than-expected April CPI,
U.S. political headlines in mid-May that were interpreted as likely impeding the
Administration’s ability to advance its economic policy agenda, and the somewhat
weaker-than-expected May employment situation report. Option-implied volatility on
10-year swap rates briefly jumped up following the political headlines in mid-May but
subsequently fell back to near the low end of its multiyear range.
The 5-year measure of TIPS-based inflation compensation edged down 5 basis
points, with the decline mostly attributable to the lower-than-expected April CPI print,
while the 5-to-10-year forward measure decreased 11 basis points. Spreads of agency
MBS over comparable-maturity Treasury securities tightened a touch in reaction to the
reinvestments discussion in the May FOMC minutes.

advance its economic and regulatory reforms appeared to decline further, as stock prices
of firms with high effective tax rates—which would benefit the most from corporate tax
cuts—underperformed broader equity indexes.
One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—was about
unchanged, on net, and stands near the bottom of its historical distribution. Political
headlines on May 17 led to a decline of 1¾ percent in the S&P 500 index on that day and
a brief spike in the VIX that quickly retraced. The box “Drivers of Recent Movements of
Implied Volatility” investigates the role of policy uncertainty and other factors in the low
level of option-implied equity market volatility in recent months.

Drivers of Recent Movements of Implied Volatility
Recent market commentary has been attentive to the historically low levels of option-implied equity
market volatility as measured by the VIX. To some, the low VIX has been puzzling in light of the
heightened uncertainty about U.S. economic policy; indeed, it has been conjectured that the low
levels of the VIX may be driven in part by a recent proliferation of investment strategies involving
the selling of options. We show that low implied volatility largely reflects low actual market price
volatility, which historically is more closely connected to perceived downside risks to near-term
economic growth than to popular measures of economic policy uncertainty. Nonetheless, we
cannot entirely account for the recent extraordinarily low readings on actual market volatility.
Volatility over the next 30 days implied by S&P 500 index options is close to the 5th percentile of its
historical distribution (red line, figure 1).1 However, the same can be said for actual volatility, the
blue line, measured as an exponentially weighted average of past intraday returns. To understand
the recent low level of the VIX, it is helpful to dissect it into the sum of expected near-term volatility,
the black line, and an insurance premium against market moves in either direction, known as the
variance risk premium, shown in figure 2.2 Although the variance risk premium is in the bottom
quartile of its historical distribution, it has been fairly stable since 2012 and does not appear to be a
major driver of recent very low VIX levels. This observation suggests that the current low level of
the VIX is significantly driven by expected volatility, while potential drivers such as changes in
investment strategies among certain participants in the equity options market—which would work
through the variance risk premium—are likely less important.
As shown in figure 1, expected volatility and actual volatility are tightly linked, so to better
understand movements in the VIX, the remainder of the analysis focuses on two potential drivers of
recent actual volatility: a measure that reflects economic policy uncertainty (the Baker-Bloom-Davis
index) and a measure that reflects perceived downside risks to economic fundamentals (the one-
quarter-ahead recession probability derived from the Survey of Professional Forecasters). Figure 3
s
e t shows both measures. While the policy uncertainty index is well above its long-run median, the
k
r recession probability is closer to the lower end of its range. Policy uncertainty and recession risks
a
M tend to be highly correlated around recessions but are less correlated when the economy
l
a is expanding.
ci
n
a To evaluate the relative importance of these measures for explaining volatility, we estimate
n
Fi quarterly regressions of actual volatility on the two measures, both jointly and individually. Jointly,
both measures explain 33 percent of the variation in actual volatility. Individually, recession
probability explains 29 percent of the variation, whereas economic policy uncertainty by itself
explains only 16 percent. This finding suggests that, over the full sample, economic policy
uncertainty adds little explanatory power once we account for recession risk.
Thus, while economic policy uncertainty has increased of late, we should not be too surprised that it
has not led to a marked increase in actual volatility or the VIX. However, the question of why actual
volatility is at its lowest level since the early 1990s cannot be fully explained by the level of
recession risk.
1 Although this analysis focuses on the VIX, conclusions hold for longer-dated implied volatility estimates, which
are also hovering at or near post-crisis lows.
2 The decomposition of the VIX into the expectations and premium components was provided by FRBNY staff.

In the corporate bond market, spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-
grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury
securities were little changed, on net, and remained below the medians of their respective
historical distributions.
Foreign Developments
Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were supported by
generally positive economic data releases abroad, the reduction of political risk in
Europe, and robust first-quarter earnings reports in a number of countries. By contrast,
political developments in the United States appeared at times to weigh on global market
sentiment.
The broad U.S. dollar depreciated about 1¼ percent, mostly reflecting weakness
against AFE currencies. In particular, the euro was buoyed by the outcome of the second
round of the French presidential election on May 7 and stronger-than-expected euro-area
macroeconomic data releases. U.S. developments, including political uncertainty and
mixed data reports, also weighed on the dollar. The Brazilian real fell about 3 percent
against the dollar amid adverse local political developments.
Most AFE 10-year sovereign yields were slightly down over the intermeeting
period. Spreads of most euro-area sovereign bonds over those of comparable-maturity
German bunds narrowed slightly, largely on diminished perceptions of downside political s
t
e
and economic risks. Late in the period, Italian spreads edged up on the possibility of an k

Equity prices rose in most advanced economies. EME equity indexes increased

slightly, on balance, although Brazilian stocks took a sizable hit after the emergence of
new corruption allegations against President Temer. EME sovereign bond spreads were
little changed, while flows into EME mutual funds remained robust.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets remained stable over the
intermeeting period. The effective federal funds rate held steady at 91 basis points,
closely tracked by the overnight Eurodollar rate. Term unsecured funding rates, such as
yields on three-month commercial paper and Eurodollar deposits, also remained roughly

flat, and their spreads relative to comparable term OIS rates narrowed further. The box
“The Recent Decline in the LIBOR–OIS Spread” reviews developments in the spread as
the effects of money market fund (MMF) reform on this spread have abated.
Treasury repo volumes were higher, on average, by about $50 billion compared
with the previous intermeeting period, in part reflecting somewhat higher net holdings by
primary dealers of Treasury securities, which are typically funded by repos, as well as
increased matched-book repo activity. Even with heightened volumes, overnight
Treasury repo rates remained near the low end of recent ranges as MMFs increased their
lending in overnight repo markets to shorten the average maturity of their portfolios
ahead of the June FOMC meeting.
ON RRP take-up averaged $175 billion, in line with the prior intermeeting
period.1 The Federal Reserve System conducted several tests of its operational toolkit to

The Recent Decline in the LIBOR−OIS Spread
Since February, the spread between the three-month LIBOR (London interbank
offered rate) and the OIS (the overnight index swap) has narrowed notably and now
stands at 11 basis points, near its average from 2013 to 2015, as shown in figure 1.
Short-term funding pressures, which intensified in the summer of 2016 as money
market fund (MMF) reforms were causing prime MMFs to shrink, appear to have
abated as banks acquired new funding sources for their commercial paper (CP) and
negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) as well as additional funding via other types of
instruments.1
In the year leading up to the October 2016 implementation deadline for these reforms,
prime MMFs greatly reduced their unsecured lending to banks through CP, CDs, and
Eurodollar deposits. This reduction in the supply of funds was widely cited as driving
up bank unsecured term funding costs. The spread between three-month LIBOR—
which closely tracks CD and CP rates—and OIS increased from about 15 basis points
to a bit above 40 basis points over this period, as banks offered higher rates to
attract funding.2
Temporarily higher yields attracted additional demand from money market investors
and allowed banks to replace part of the funding lost from MMFs. To be sure, total CP
and CDs outstanding have declined about $300 billion since early 2015, but the decline
has not been as steep as the $700 billion drop in MMF holdings, as shown in figure 2.

1 The refor m imposed floating net asset values, or NAVs, for institutional prime funds and
municipal funds and permits liquidity fees and redemption gates for all nongovernment funds.
2 The significant movements in the LIBOR−OIS spread over the past year do not appear to have
been driven by perceptions of changing bank credit quality. Moreover, despite concerns over
LIBOR’s calculation methodology, its co-movement with CP and CD rates suggests that LIBOR
remains a useful measure of banks’ unsecured borrowing costs. LIBOR also serves as a reference
rate for trillions of dollars in adjustable-rate loans and interest rate derivatives.

Available data on investors in CP and CDs outside of MMFs are very limited. Market
participants suggest that the sources of new demand for money market instruments
have included bond funds and nonfinancial corporations. MMF substitutes, such as
private liquidity funds and offshore money market funds, do not appear to have
substantially increased their holdings of CP and CDs.
Short-term funding pressures have also been alleviated as banks that had previously
relied on prime MMFs for funding replaced some CP and CD issuance with other
instruments. In particular, banks have raised funds through repos, advances from
Federal Home Loan Banks, issuance of dollar-denominated bonds and shorter-term
debt, and growth in deposits other than CDs, as shown in figure 3.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
On the whole, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households
continued to be supportive of economic activity over the intermeeting period. However,
the growth of core loans at banks has stepped down this year, reflecting both weaker
demand for business loans and tighter credit standards for consumer loans. In addition,
the expansion of total consumer credit has continued to moderate, and the growth of
residential mortgage lending slowed a bit in the first quarter, though it remained near the
high end of its recent range. Corporate bond issuance has generally been strong.
 Financing conditions for large nonfinancial firms remained solid. Banks’
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans bounced back in April and May after
declining in the first quarter, though the pace seen in May remained below
that of a year ago. Gross bond issuance strengthened significantly in May
after a typical seasonal slowdown in April.
 Credit continued to be generally available for small businesses, though
demand has remained subdued. Lenders to small businesses noted that
delinquency rates have continued to edge up from historically low levels, but
credit standards for small business loans have reportedly remained unchanged.
 The expansion of banks’ consumer loans continued to ebb in April and May,
and growth of overall consumer credit has continued to moderate in recent
months. Delinquency rates on subprime credit card and auto loans have
drifted up from low levels, and we have seen some signs of tightening credit
standards in these markets.

C&I loans picked up in April and May after a weak first quarter, though their
growth rate has remained well below the strong pace seen a year ago. As we described in
the April Tealbook, in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey banks reported a broad-
based decline in demand for C&I loans in the first quarter.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained solid on average. Share
repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2016 and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the first
quarter of this year remained robust overall, albeit somewhat below the very strong
average pace seen in recent years. Announcements of new share repurchase programs
and M&A activity continued their downward trend, possibly signaling lower future debt
issuance.
The credit performance of nonfinancial corporations remained stable. Balance
sheet leverage indicators ticked down a bit in the fourth quarter but remained close to the
historically high levels seen over the past 20 years. While default rates were little
changed in April, bond rating downgrades outpaced upgrades in both number and volume
in May, indicating a slight deterioration in credit quality.
With reports in hand for almost all S&P 500 firms, aggregate corporate earnings
in the first quarter are estimated to have remained near the level seen in the fourth quarter
on a seasonally adjusted basis, significantly above their year-ago level. Wall Street
analysts again revised up their projections for year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms
through mid-May.
Small Businesses
Overall, the demand for credit from small businesses remained tepid, while the
supply of credit generally continued to appear accommodative. Small business loan
originations held steady in March and were close to the volume of a year ago. Survey
data suggest that credit supply remained stable, with nearly 40 percent of respondents
from the April release of the quarterly Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index survey
reporting that it was “somewhat or very easy” to obtain credit over the past 12 months,
s
one of the highest such readings since 2008. While lenders noted that loan delinquency n
o
ti
rates have continued to edge up from historically low levels, credit standards for small di
n
business loans have reportedly remained unchanged. The April survey also indicated that o

Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets remained
accommodative. CRE loans on banks’ books continued to grow robustly in April, with
nonfarm nonresidential loans leading the expansion this year. However, the average
growth rate over April and May is a bit lower than that during the first quarter, reflecting
in part a slowdown in both construction and multifamily lending. Commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) issuance through the first five months of the year has been
similar to the issuance over the first five months of 2016. While delinquency rates on
CRE loans at banks continued to tick down in the first quarter, the delinquency rate on
loans in CMBS pools continued to increase. The rise in the CMBS delinquency rate is
mostly confined to loans that were originated during the period of weak underwriting
prior to the crisis. These delinquencies have generally been expected by market
participants and are not anticipated to have a material effect on credit availability or
market conditions.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on
balance, and were mostly unaffected by the initiation of Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy
process.1 Gross issuance of municipal bonds remained solid in May. On net, the number
and dollar volume of credit rating downgrades outpaced the number of upgrades, possibly
signaling a slight deterioration in the credit quality of state and local governments.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained generally
accommodative over the intermeeting period. Mortgage rates declined slightly, in line
with longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) yields, but remained
elevated relative to the third quarter of 2016. Despite the higher level of mortgage rates,
first-quarter growth in total residential mortgage lending remained near the high end of

credit scores and harder-to-document incomes.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally
accommodative; however, some indicators point to reductions in credit availability in
recent months. The tighter conditions are especially apparent within the subprime
segment, where there has been some further deterioration of credit performance.
Credit card balances continued to grow in March at a robust year-over-year rate,
though the pace moderated a bit from 2016. Outstanding credit card balances among
prime borrowers continued to grow apace with prior years, despite an upward drift in
interest rates, and delinquencies remained low by historical standards. However, the
growth of credit card balances among subprime borrowers slowed somewhat, and
delinquency rates for this group have continued to increase.
Year-over-year growth in auto loans remained solid through the first quarter.
Overall delinquency rates on auto loans continued to be relatively low, but the
delinquency rate among subprime borrowers remained elevated, reflecting easier lending
standards in 2015 and 2016. Recent evidence suggests that these standards have
tightened; for example, the credit rating of the average car borrower has trended up, and
new extensions of subprime auto loans have declined. We expect that tighter auto
lending conditions will lead to improved loan performance among subprime borrowers.

Risks and Uncertainty t

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n c
U
&
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic activity as s
k
s
being about in line, on balance, with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark Ri
used by the FOMC). Several factors point to less-than-average uncertainty. Many
empirical indicators of uncertainty are subdued, including options-based indexes of
expected stock market volatility (such as the VIX) and corporate bond spreads. In
addition, we see the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook as having subsided
further since late last year, particularly with the outcome of the French elections.
However, other considerations point to greater-than-average uncertainty. For example,
we think that somewhat greater uncertainty continues to prevail about the future direction
of federal government policies than before the recent U.S. elections. That uncertainty is
reflected in the Baker, Bloom, and Davis index of economic policy uncertainty, which
remains at a higher level, on average, than in the two years before the elections.
We now judge the risks to our medium-term GDP projection as balanced. In
previous Tealbooks, we considered the risk of monetary policy having to return to the
effective lower bound (ELB) as tilting the risks to our economic outlook somewhat to the
downside. However, based on stochastic simulations in the FRB/US model around the
current baseline forecast, we estimate that the probability of returning to the ELB
sometime over the next three years has declined to 23 percent, which is below the
threshold level of 25 percent that we proposed in the April Tealbook for removing the
downside skew associated with ELB risk.1 We see the risks around our projection for the
unemployment rate as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as also balanced.
With regard to inflation, we continue to see the current level of uncertainty as in
line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside and upside as
roughly balanced. To the downside, the Michigan survey measure of longer-run inflation
expectations remains very low, although other survey-based indicators of longer-run
inflation expectations have not moved down. In addition, U.S. monetary policy
normalization could generate a greater appreciation of the dollar than we have anticipated
1 The methodology for calculating this probability was described in the box “A Guidepost for
Dropping Effective Lower Bound Risk from the Assessment of Risks” in the April Tealbook. See the
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate” for our current and projected estimates of this probability.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS k s
s
Ri
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario illustrates the
possible economic consequences of a broad policy disappointment in which consumer,
business, and investor expectations deteriorate markedly as the anticipated fiscal
expansion and reduction in regulatory burdens do not materialize. The second scenario
assumes that economic activity is stronger than in the baseline; in addition, inflation is
assumed to be more sensitive to tighter resource utilization. In the third scenario, we
explore the implications of a lower natural rate of unemployment than in the baseline,
with only gradual recognition by policymakers and the staff about the true level of the
natural rate. The fourth scenario presents outcomes associated with a situation in which
long-term interest rates do not respond to the increases in the federal funds rate that are
assumed in the baseline—a phenomenon reminiscent of the “Greenspan conundrum”
seen in the mid-2000s. In the fifth scenario, we consider the possibility that faster U.S.
policy normalization, prompted by a pickup in inflation, leads to financial turbulence in
vulnerable emerging market economies and a stronger appreciation of the dollar. The
sixth and last scenario analyzes the effect on U.S. macroeconomic performance of
stronger foreign growth.
We simulate these scenarios using three staff models.2 In all but two scenarios,
the federal funds rate is governed by the same rule as in the baseline. One exception is
the Broad Policy Disappointment scenario, in which we assume an alternative adjustment
to the intercept in the baseline rule. The other exception is the EME Turbulence and
Stronger Dollar scenario, where we assume that the unexpected increase in U.S. inflation
in the second half of this year triggers a temporarily larger response of the federal funds
rate than implied by the baseline rule, although such a response is later unwound as
2 The models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; EDO, which is an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy;
and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

In this scenario, we assume that the federal government fails to implement the s
k
s
fiscal expansion that is incorporated in the baseline.3 In addition, other policy changes Ri
that financial market participants may have priced into current asset values, such as an
easing of regulatory burdens, fail to materialize.4 Moreover, this scenario assumes that
the staff has not fully appreciated the positive effects of more buoyant consumer and
business sentiment on spending in the baseline projection. Consequently, in addition to
the direct, conventional restraint on aggregate demand stemming from the fact that the
fiscal expansion does not materialize, economic activity is also curtailed by an erosion in
consumer sentiment and an increase in perceived risk by businesses and financial
markets. In particular, the triple-B corporate bond spread rises about 40 basis points
above the baseline in 2018, and equity prices fall almost 10 percent from peak to trough.5
As a result, real GDP growth slows to about 1 percent in 2018, roughly
1 percentage point less than in the baseline. By the end of 2022, the unemployment rate
has risen about ½ percentage point from its level at the end of 2017 to 4.7 percent—just
below the staff’s assumption for the natural rate and ¼ percentage point higher than in the
baseline. With labor market resources less tight and inflation modestly lower than in the
baseline, the federal funds rate rises more gradually and is just over 3 percent at the end
of 2022, about 1 percentage point below the baseline rate.6
3 In this scenario, we unwind the adjustments to the rule for setting the federal funds rate and to
the long-term interest rate term premium that were made in the baseline projection to account for the
assumed fiscal expansion.
4 To be clear, in both the baseline and the alternative simulation, regulatory relief is assumed to
not affect the economy directly but rather indirectly through its effects on sentiment and asset values.
5 In this scenario, equity values decline gradually over the course of several quarters next year.
The results shown here are little changed if, instead, the decline in stock prices occurs immediately in the
first quarter of 2018.
6 Without the change in sentiment and equity prices, the failure to implement the fiscal expansion
alone would imply that real GDP growth is 0.3 percentage point lower than in the baseline in 2018 and is
almost the same as in the baseline in 2019, while the unemployment rate is about 0.2 percentage point
higher at the end of 2019. In addition, inflation would be a touch lower than in the baseline. These
developments, together with the adjustment to the rule for setting the federal funds rate, would result in a
federal funds rate that is ½ percentage point below the baseline at the end of 2020.

several surveys of consumer sentiment and business activity have remained upbeat in c
n
U
recent months. Furthermore, while business investment was weak over the previous two
&
years, data for this year so far show investment to have picked up considerably. s
k
s
Motivated by these positive developments, this scenario assumes faster consumer and
Ri
business spending than in the baseline, with growth in residential investment also well
above the moderate pace shown in the staff forecast.7 Moreover, consistent with the view
that the Phillips curve could be steeper at higher rates of resource utilization than when
economic activity is relatively weak, we postulate that inflation and wages become more
sensitive to tighter resource utilization than in the standard version of the EDO model.8
Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second half of 2017,
compared with a 3 percent pace in the baseline. The unemployment rate falls more
rapidly, bottoming out at 3½ percent in 2018 and 2019 and remaining lower than in the
baseline for some time thereafter. With resource utilization running tighter and the
Phillips curve assumed to be steeper than in the standard version of the model, inflation
moves above 2 percent in the second half of 2017 and rises to about 2½ percent by 2020.9
The federal funds rate reaches 4½ percent at the end of 2019 and peaks slightly above
5 percent in 2021. Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would
eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation
back down to 2 percent. The unemployment rate does not need to exceed the natural rate
in order to bring inflation back down—simply returning to the natural rate is enough—
because longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored throughout this scenario.
7 In the staff forecast, residential investment averages 4 percent per year between 2017 and 2019.
In this scenario, we calibrate the composition of aggregate demand so that residential investment instead
grows around 6½ percent per year.
8 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth and slack, see, for example,
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet? Assessing Progress toward Full
Employment and Price Stability,” Economic Letter, vol. 9 (13) (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,
October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf. The greater sensitivity of
price inflation assumed here is consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE models, such as Frank
Smets and Rafael Wouters (2007), “Shocks and Frictions in U.S. Business Cycles: A Bayesian DSGE
Approach,” American Economic Review, vol. 97 (June), pp. 586606.
9 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for
wages and prices in this scenario; the smaller costs lead to a steeper Phillips curve. Had we used our
standard coefficients in the wage and price equations, inflation would have been only about 2 percent in
2022, as in the baseline.

k considerable uncertainty and could be lower than the staff’s estimate of 4.9 percent. In
s
Ri
this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 4 percent for the
past few years and remains at that level in the future. Given the difficulties associated
with ascertaining the level of the natural rate, we also assume that policymakers’ and the
staff’s perceptions of the natural rate converge to the true natural rate only gradually over
time. Hence, the gap between the actual and perceived natural rate is not fully eliminated
until the end of 2022.
Because policymakers do not fully recognize the lower natural rate—and the
correspondingly higher level of potential—until several years into the simulation, they
perceive a lower path of the unemployment rate as implying a more positive output gap
than in the baseline, providing an incentive to raise the federal funds rate, all else being
equal. As events unfold in this scenario, the initially slightly tighter stance of policy
holds real GDP growth close to the baseline for some time. As policymakers’ and the
staff’s estimates of the natural rate of unemployment converge to the truth, GDP growth
rises a touch above the staff forecast by the end of 2022, while the unemployment rate is
¾ percentage point below. Inflation falls a shade below the Tealbook projection by the
end of 2022. As the higher level of potential becomes apparent to policymakers and the
staff, they recognize that resource utilization is less tight than they had previously
perceived; as a result, and with the lower path for inflation, the federal funds rate drops
below the baseline by the end of 2021.
A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum (FRB/US)
The Committee has raised the federal funds rate three times following the period
of near-zero rates. However, according to several measures of term premiums on longer-
term Treasury yields, the rate increases occurred in conjunction with ongoing declines in
those premiums; indeed, following the initial rise from the ELB, 10-year Treasury yields
dropped for three quarters. The absence of a clear imprint from monetary tightening on

This scenario simulates the macroeconomic consequences of such a disconnect c

between the policy rate and longer-term interest rates. Consistent with the original
&
Greenspan conundrum period, we keep long-term rates fixed over the next six quarters at s
k
s
their levels as of the third quarter of this year, reflecting a movement in term premiums
Ri
that is not attributable to heightened pessimism about the economic outlook on the part of
market participants. The short-term federal funds rate continues to evolve according to
the prescriptions of the baseline policy rule. Starting in the first quarter of 2019, the
conundrum slowly unwinds, and the link between short- and long-term rates is fully
restored by the end of the simulation period.
In this scenario, lower long-term rates boost asset prices and spur consumption
and investment spending. As a result, real GDP growth reaches 2¾ percent in 2018,
about ½ percentage point above the baseline. With a more buoyant economy, the
trajectory for the unemployment rate is substantially below the staff forecast, reaching a
low of 3 percent in 2020; given the flatness of the model’s wage and price Phillips
curves, inflation moves only marginally above the baseline. By the end of 2019,
consistent with output being well above potential, the federal funds rate increases to
almost 4¼ percent, more than ½ percentage point higher than in the Tealbook projection.
As the conundrum unwinds and long rates start to rise along with the short rate, GDP
growth slows and the unemployment rate moves back toward the baseline, though it
remains about ½ percentage point lower in 2022.
EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar (SIGMA)
In our baseline, we see the effects of U.S. policy normalization as likely to be
manageable for most foreign economies, even while assuming that the federal funds rate
rises somewhat faster than markets appear to envision. However, a significant risk
remains that U.S. policy normalization could generate substantial adverse spillovers
abroad, especially if it proceeds much more quickly than in the baseline and is driven
mainly by concerns about U.S. inflation rather than by faster U.S. economic growth.
10 This risk was previously discussed in a box and an alternative scenario in the September 2016
Tealbook, both titled “A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum.”

ss

ss
RRii
By early next year, EMEs experience large capital outflows and sizable depreciations of
their currencies amidst an ongoing flight from EME assets. The turbulence in the EMEs
has adverse financial spillovers to both the United States and the rest of the global
economy. All told, foreign GDP growth runs, on average, 1 percentage point below the
baseline in 2018 and 2019, while flight-to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar to
appreciate 10 percent.
The stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth depress U.S. real net exports.
Consequently, U.S. real GDP growth moderates to about 1½ percent in 2018 and
1¼ percent in 2019, ½ percentage point less than in the baseline. Lower import prices
and weaker economic activity cause core PCE inflation to run, on average, at 1½ percent
in 2018 and 2019. After EME financial conditions begin deteriorating sharply in early
2018, the federal funds rate follows a considerably shallower path than in the baseline,
reaching only 3 percent by the end of 2019.
Stronger Foreign Growth (SIGMA)
In our baseline forecast, we expect foreign output to expand at a moderate pace
and inflation to slowly edge closer to central bank targets, as headwinds facing the
foreign economies gradually diminish. However, survey and activity indicators have
come in somewhat stronger than expected in recent months, and the expansion abroad
may prove faster, especially if accommodative policies become more effective in the
context of ongoing balance sheet repair and improvements in consumer and business
confidence. In this scenario we assume that foreign GDP growth rises to about
3¼ percent in 2017 and 2018, ½ percentage point higher per year than in our baseline
projection. Increased optimism about the foreign outlook, including the perception of
diminished tail risks, causes the broad real dollar to depreciate 8 percent by the end
of 2019.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c
n
U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
yy intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
tt
nn
aaii errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
tt
rr
ee Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
cc
nn intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
UU
&& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
ss
kk apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
ss
RRii
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with
those in the Tealbook baseline. The prescriptions of simple rules are generally a little
higher than those in the April Tealbook because the staff raised the baseline path for the
output gap. The optimal control policy rate paths are also somewhat higher than those in
the April Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s projection of a somewhat larger undershooting
of the natural rate of unemployment in coming years alongside no material change in the
staff’s projection for inflation. All of the simple rules and all but one optimal control
exercise prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate over the next few years
than assumed in the staff forecast. In a special exhibit, we conduct optimal control
experiments with a version of the FRB/US model that incorporates an alternative to the
assumption of model-consistent expectations typically used in our simulations.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and
a first-difference rule.1 These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections
for the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels. The top and
middle panels also provide the path for the federal funds rate used in the staff baseline.
• All but one of the prescriptions of the Taylor-type policy rules in the third and
fourth quarters of 2017 are a little higher than in the April Tealbook, with the
influence of a more positive output gap more than offsetting that of lower
inflation.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not feature an interest
rate smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the
near term than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline.
1 We provide details on each of these four simple rules in the appendix to this section.

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period
(beginning in the current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The
"average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same 12−quarter period
as the Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*.

• The near-term prescriptions of the first-difference rule are a little higher than
in April, reflecting the staff’s projection of a somewhat faster rise later this
year in output.
A MEDIUM-TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model given
the staff’s baseline projection. This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• The current-quarter estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is 29 basis
points higher than projected in the April Tealbook, reflecting the upward
revision to the output gap.
• At 2.05 percent, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is more than 1¼ percentage
points above the average projected real federal funds rate in the staff forecast
for the same 12-quarter period, up from an average difference of a little less
than 1 percentage point over the past year. Also, Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r* is about 1 percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the real
federal funds rate in the longer run.
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is
below the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction
function used by the staff in constructing the baseline forecast includes an
interest rate smoothing term, reacts to both the output gap and inflation
deviations from 2 percent, and is therefore not designed to close the output
gap over only three years.

Taylor (1999) rule, and the first-difference rule.2 These simulations reflect the
endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation in response to the different federal
funds rate paths implied by each of the specified policy rules.3 The policy rate paths
prescribed by each rule are modestly higher than in the April Tealbook, reflecting the
upward revision to the staff’s projection of the output gap.
• The policy rate path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the
intercept. The federal funds rate increases, on average, a bit more than
1 percentage point per year in 2017 and 2018 and reaches 3¾ percent in late
2019. The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate
peaks at 4¼ percent in 2021 before moving toward its long-run level of
3 percent.
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which has a constant intercept, prescribes a
slightly higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than the
path associated with the Tealbook baseline, which incorporates a judgmental
intercept adjustment. The difference in policy rates arising from this
alternative treatment of the intercept is small and dissipates too rapidly to have
marked implications for the real longer-term interest rates that influence
economic activity in the FRB/US model. Thus, macroeconomic outcomes
under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are similar to those in the Tealbook
baseline.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years. This
initially more rapid tightening of policy is followed by a period, beginning
early in the next decade and lasting several years, during which the federal
funds rate is lower than in the Tealbook projection. Because market
participants understand that higher short-term real interest rates during the

that policymakers are committed to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial
market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through
on this commitment but also understand the macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

next several years will be offset by lower real interest rates later on, the paths
for the real 10-year Treasury yield under these two rules are, on net, not far
from that under the Tealbook baseline. Economic activity in the FRB/US
model tends to be closely linked to the real 10-year Treasury yield, and thus
the paths for unemployment and inflation under the two rules are similar to
the paths in the Tealbook baseline despite the initially large differences in the
paths of the federal funds rate.4
• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower path for
s
e some years thereafter. This latter divergence occurs because the first-

inflation. Thus, the first-difference rule generates outcomes for the
unemployment rate that are markedly below those associated with the baseline
policy rule. Consequently, the first-difference rule produces inflation
outcomes that are somewhat above those in the Tealbook baseline projection.
• Compared with the corresponding simulations in the April Tealbook, the
federal funds rate paths prescribed by the simple rules are 0.1 to
0.3 percentage point higher, on average, over the next three years, reflecting
higher projected resource utilization.
4 The Taylor (1993) rule calls for slightly lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over the
period shown because it does not respond as strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level
over the next several years. As a consequence, the Taylor (1993) rule generates a lower trajectory for the
unemployment rate and a slightly higher trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor (1999) rule.

OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices in a way
that improves economic outcomes.6
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path. This higher path arises
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome
that these policymakers judge to be costly. The tighter policy results in a path
for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of
the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the
Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited
response of inflation to changes in levels of resource utilization in the
FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below both the path for the optimal control simulation with
equal weights and the Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric loss

The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix in this Tealbook section
provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ actions and that are taken as credible by wage
and price setters and by financial market participants. However, the simulations are not conditioned on
policy commitments that might have been made prior to the simulation period.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered
by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that
helps achieve this outcome. Because the public believes that policymakers
will follow through on this policy rate path even as the economy evolves as
projected with the substantial undershooting of the natural rate of
unemployment, the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2 percent more
quickly than in the case of equal weights. Starting around 2025 (not shown),
the unemployment rate runs a little above its natural level for several years as
policymakers seek to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from a
prolonged period with limited resource slack.7
• The third simulation exercise, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a
loss function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is
five times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative
than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with
undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years. The reason
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff
because inflation responds only weakly to resource utilization. Hence,
policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment, which this specification of the loss function
sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but
is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the resulting
optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than under
the specification with equal weights in an effort to undo the projected
7 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to re-optimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function. For the other three
specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under commitment and discretion are not much
different from one another.

undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment; the federal funds rate
remains near 6 percent over the remainder of the period shown. The paths for
the real federal funds rate and the real 10-year Treasury yield are also notably
higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights. While this
policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to those of all except one of the
other loss functions over the period shown, it keeps the unemployment rate
close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.8
• With the exception of the simulation with a minimal weight on rate

OPTIMAL CONTROL: ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXPECTATIONS
FORMATION
In the optimal control simulations described above, in addition to closing the
unemployment gap, policymakers eventually return inflation to 2 percent on a sustained
basis despite running a policy over the next several years that, in most simulations, is
markedly tighter than under the Tealbook baseline. In those simulations, we assume that
agents form “model-consistent expectations”—that is, we assume that the public knows
the structure of the economy, understands policymakers’ strategy concerning current and
future settings of the federal funds rate, and uses that knowledge when forming
expectations of future movements in asset prices, wages, and inflation. These
assumptions facilitate achievement of policymakers’ stated objectives, particularly for
inflation. In particular, in simulations with model-consistent expectations, long-term
inflation expectations move to 2 percent almost immediately from their current value of
1.8 percent assumed in the staff’s baseline, as the public expects that the policymakers
will act vigorously to bring inflation to 2 percent over the medium run. An alternative

sometimes below the case of equal weights.

assumption is that inflation expectations are “sticky,” in the sense that they respond
slowly to changes in actual inflation and other influences. The staff view underlying the
Tealbook baseline forecast is consistent with the latter perspective: Long-term inflation
expectations are expected to rise only gradually toward 2 percent even as tight resource
utilization lifts actual inflation slightly above 2 percent for an extended period.9
In this special exhibit, we explore the implications for optimal control policy and
macroeconomic outcomes of departing from the assumption of model-consistent
expectations. To do so, we assume instead that the public forms expectations based
solely on historical relationships as represented by small-scale statistical models—that is,
we assume “VAR-based expectations.”10 To illustrate the policy implications of this
alternative assumption, we show simulations under model-consistent expectations and
under VAR-based expectations for two loss functions: “Equal weights” and
“Asymmetric weight on ugap.”
• The first simulation, “Equal weights: MCE,” reproduces the optimal control
policy and outcomes from the “Equal weights” simulation of the previous
exhibit. The second simulation, “Equal weights: VAR-based,” is obtained
under optimal control using the VAR-based expectations version of the
FRB/US model. In the early part of the period shown, policymakers choose a
fairly similar path for the federal funds rate, but model-consistent and VAR-
based expectations produce some differences in economic outcomes. In the
model-consistent expectations case, the public foresees the inflationary
implications of high future levels of resource utilization, but the public also
expects that a tighter stance of policy will follow. These anticipations initially
induce a lower path for inflation than under VAR-based expectations and a
higher path for the 10-year real Treasury yield, which is a key influence on

simulations of the FRB/US model in the Risks and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.

aggregate demand in the FRB/US model. By contrast, under VAR-based
expectations, given the low initial level of inflation expectations and the fact
that the public does not accurately foresee the unusually low levels of
unemployment that are forthcoming, policymakers need only to raise the
federal funds rate for a relatively brief period to contain inflation expectations
and achieve the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Moreover, later in
the simulation, the paths for the federal funds in the two models diverge,
despite the real 10-year Treasury yields converging. This divergence arises
because, in the VAR-based expectations version of the model, the 10-year
Treasury yield is not tied directly to the future path for the federal funds rate
as it is in the model-consistent expectations version of the model. This feature
explains why the differences in inflation and unemployment are small relative
to the differences in the paths for the nominal rate late in the simulation.
• The third simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap: MCE,” reproduces the
optimal control policy and outcomes from the previous exhibit when there is
no penalty in the loss function on unemployment undershooting its natural
rate. Also shown are results from a fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on
ugap: VAR-based,” for which the asymmetric loss function is again used, this
time with the FRB/US model under VAR-based expectations. Unconcerned
by persistently low unemployment, policymakers with these preferences
choose policies that are, for some time, notably easier than in the
corresponding equal-weights cases. Moreover, policymakers facing model-
consistent expectations choose a lower path for the nominal funds rate than
they do under VAR-based expectations. Intuitively, the belief under model-
consistent expectations that policymakers are committed to achieving
2 percent inflation induces the public to look beyond the lengthy period of
very low unemployment when forming inflation expectations. The assumed
credibility of this promise helps line up actual inflation with the longer-term
objective over the period shown and beyond. Under VAR-based expectations,
policymakers do not benefit in the same way from the foresight and
conviction of the public. Initially, long-term inflation expectations stand
somewhat below the Committee’s inflation objective but, absent a sufficiently
strong policy response, would eventually be lifted persistently above 2 percent
by the lengthy period of low unemployment. To preemptively limit the
associated losses, policymakers in the VAR-based expectations case must

tighten policy more in the short run than in the model-consistent
expectations case.
• This special exhibit highlights the important role that expectations formation
can play in determining optimal policy by presenting results for two stark
alternatives. When expectations are model consistent, promises to achieve
policy objectives in the future can generate powerful effects on current
economic outcomes through expectations. But, these channels assume the
public possesses detailed knowledge of the structure of the economy and the
policy strategy. By contrast, under VAR-based expectations, the public only

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic
implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as commitment
strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES”
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported
in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t.
The right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE price
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( and ), the output gap estimate
for the current period (ygap), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the
t 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3|𝑡𝑡
output gap (∆4ygap ). The value of policymakers’ longer-run inflation objective, denoted πLR,
t+3|t
is 2 percent.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board
s staff.1 The intercepts of these rules, denoted , are constant and chosen so that they are

e
n quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters. When the Tealbook is
o
M
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters. Rules that
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. To isolate the effects of
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate. The “Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model
of the U.S. economy.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012).
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.
3 For a discussion of this and other concepts of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others
(2016).

which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The measure is
derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based expectations—that is,
agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future variables are
determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and
the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close
the output gap at the end of this time frame, whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal
funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
price inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps
( , measure𝑃𝑃d𝑃𝑃 a𝑃𝑃s the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate. In the following equation, the
𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a
quarterly discount factor, :

𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.

The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.
