Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook

Incoming data suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at an D
n
above-trend pace. Real GDP appears to be rising at a solid annual rate of 2¾ percent in o
c
E
the second half of this year. The labor market looks to have tightened further, with the c
ti
s
unemployment rate dropping to 4.1 percent in October and the gain in payroll e
m
employment bouncing back after being depressed by the effects of the recent hurricanes. o
D
Over the medium term, we expect real GDP growth to slow gradually from
2½ percent this year and next, to 2 percent in 2019, and then to 1¾ percent in 2020 as
monetary policy continues to tighten. As in the previous projection, we assume tax cuts
will be implemented in early 2018, but we have shifted the composition of the cuts
toward corporate taxes and have also incorporated some small positive effects on
aggregate supply. Nonetheless, by the end of 2020 the level of real GDP is essentially
the same as in our October Tealbook forecast.
As in our previous projection, we forecast that output growth will be sufficient to
push the level of real GDP 2¼ percent above our estimate of its potential by mid-2019,
and we expect the output gap to remain near that level through the end of the medium
term. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate is projected to fall to 3½ percent in 2019
and to remain at that level through 2020, 1¼ percentage points below our estimate of its
natural rate.
PCE prices rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE
prices rose 1.4 percent; both measures were a touch higher than in our October Tealbook
projection. We continue to view the unanticipated softness of this year’s readings as
largely transitory and expect core PCE price inflation to pick up next year. As resource
utilization tightens further and underlying inflation gradually edges up, core PCE price
inflation is projected to move up to 2 percent in 2019, while total PCE price inflation hits
2 percent in 2020.

DDD in 2017 but in line with both in 2018. The staff’s projections for overall PCE price
inflation is a little higher than the SPF forecast in 2017 and similar in 2018, while the
staff’s projection for core PCE price inflation is similar to the SPF forecast in both
years.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&&&
lll
eee
vvv The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
eee
DDD
the September FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic
nnn
ooo projection with the one we presented in the September Tealbook.
ccc
EEE
ccc
tttiii
GDP growth this year now looks to be a little weaker than it did in September. Nonetheless,
sss
eee
mmm we have upgraded our growth outlook slightly for next year and beyond, reflecting financial
ooo assumptions that are a little more supportive. The unemployment rate has again come in a
DDD
bit lower than we had projected, and with a further reduction in our estimate of the natural
rate of unemployment (to 4.7 percent), our projection for the unemployment rate over the
medium term is revised down 0.2 percentage point relative to September. Thus, resource
utilization, as measured by the unemployment gap or the output gap, is slightly tighter in
this projection than in September.
Our projection for core PCE price inflation in 2017 is unrevised relative to the September
Tealbook, while a rise in oil prices has pushed our projection for headline inflation higher in
the near term. We continue to view this year’s weak core inflation readings as being largely
transitory, though we have reduced our core inflation projection for 2018 slightly since
September. We continue to project that both total and core inflation will edge up further
after next year and will reach 2 percent over the medium term.
With both resource utilization and inflation close to our September projections, the federal
funds rate path from the intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our
baseline forecast is also close to that in the September Tealbook.

previous Tealbooks, we had assumed that adjustments to federal fiscal policy t l
u
O
would increase the primary budget deficit—that is, the deficit excluding
&
interest costs—by ½ percent of GDP, and we implemented this fiscal e l
v
e
expansion through a cut in personal income taxes starting in the first quarter D
n
of 2018. Since the October Tealbook, however, the House and Senate have o
c
E
unveiled tax legislation that would cause the bulk of the tax cuts to accrue to c
ti
s
businesses. Accordingly, we have altered the composition of our placeholder e
m
to one-third personal tax rate cuts and two-thirds corporate tax rate cuts, but o
D
we have kept the total size and starting date the same.1
o We continue to assume that in five years, with an elevated and rising debt-
to-GDP ratio, the Congress will begin enacting deficit reduction measures
that gradually bring annual deficits back to sustainable levels.
 Now that the composition of the projected tax policy changes seems
somewhat clearer, we have built in some aggregate supply responses.
o We assume that the personal income tax rate cuts lead to a small increase
in potential labor supply, and that the corporate tax rate cuts will boost the
capital stock and lead to slightly higher structural productivity. All told,
these effects raise the level of potential output 0.1 percent by the end of
2020.
o These supply effects also translate into higher demand as households
begin to realize the higher labor income associated with greater
productivity and labor force participation.
 The placeholder tax cuts raise the level of real GDP at the end of 2020 by
about ½ percent, a little larger than what we have assumed in previous
Tealbook projections because of our new aggregate supply effects.
 We continue to project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of
government will have a roughly neutral effect on aggregate demand in 2017
1 The tax cuts recently passed by the House and currently being considered by the Senate are
heavily front-loaded such that the size of the tax cuts declines notably over a 10-year budget window on
net. Our fiscal placeholder assumes that the tax legislation ultimately passed into law will not be front-
loaded. Accordingly, over the next three years our assumed tax cuts are smaller—by roughly one-third—
than ones in the current House and Senate legislation.

Monetary Policy D
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule used in our projection calls
for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than 1 percentage point per
year, on average, over the projection period and to average 4 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2020, in line with our previous forecast.
 The SOMA portfolio declines gradually and predictably as securities are
redeemed in a manner consistent with the June 2017 addendum to the
Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise over the medium term from an
average of 2.4 percent in the current quarter to 3.6 percent by the end of 2020.
During this period, the 10‐year valuation window moves through a period of
rising short-term interest rates, and the term premium is projected to increase
to more normal levels. In this forecast, similar to previous projections, the
yield curve is inverted from 2020 through late 2026, as discussed in the box
“Why Is the Yield Curve Inverted in the Tealbook Projection?”
 The paths of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond
rate generally follow the contour of the 10-year Treasury yield.
2 A lapse of appropriations that results in a short-term shutdown of the federal government would
have only minor implications for the outlook. For example, the staff estimated that the 16-day shutdown in
October 2013 reduced GDP growth ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that year and boosted it by
an equal amount in the following quarter. This estimate embodies our judgment that there were no material
effects on private investment or consumption due to reduced confidence or increased uncertainty.

Why Is the Yield Curve Inverted in the Tealbook Projection?
&&&
lll
eee
vvv In the baseline projection, the federal funds rate implied by the staff’s assumed intercept-
eee
DDD
adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule rises above the 10-year Treasury yield starting in the
nnn
ooo second quarter of 2020, resulting in an inverted yield curve that lasts until late 2026, as
ccc
EEE
illustrated in figure 1.
ccc
tttiii
sss
eee
mmm We construct the projected 10-year yield as the sum of an expectations-hypothesis
ooo component and a term-premium component. In our framework, two factors explain the
DDD
projected inversion. First, the policy rule used in the staff projection implies that the federal
funds rate begins to overshoot its estimated long-run value of 2.5 percent in early 2019,
reaching 4¼ percent by the end of 2021 and then converging back very slowly.1 During most
of the period of this overshoot, the federal funds rate is high relative to its 10-year-forward
moving average (the expectations-hypothesis component of the 10-year yield). Second, the
10-year term premium is currently quite low and is assumed to increase only gradually to a
long-run value of about 40 basis points, which is still very low by historical standards. All else
being equal, a regime with lower term premiums makes a yield curve inversion more likely,
as the required overshoot in the federal funds rate is smaller in that case.2
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the term premium on 10-year Treasury securities estimated
using the procedure developed by Kim and Wright (2005). The term premium appears to
have trended materially lower over time, and there is evidence of structural breaks in
its mean.3
Figure 1: Interest Rate Projections
1 This overshoot, in turn, is mainly a consequence of an overshoot in the projected output gap. Inflation
is projected to exceed its target, but only slightly.
2 The box “The Flattening of the U.S. Yield Curve since December 2015” in the Financial Market
Developments section explores the reasons for the recent decline in the slope of the yield curve, focusing
on the spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields. The behavior of the slope of the yield curve in the
projection is qualitatively similar at present using either the 2-year Treasury yield or the federal funds rate.
3 See Don H. Kim and Jonathan Wright (2005), “An Arbitrage-Free Three-Factor Term Structure Model
and the Recent Behavior of Long-Term Yields and Distant-Horizon Forward Rates,” Finance and Economics
Discussion Series 2005-33 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2005/200533/200533pap.pdf. The estimated structural break dates in
figure 2, indicated by vertical lines, are as follows: January 1986, April 1995, October 2004, and August 2011.

The current regime is estimated to have started in late 2011 and implies an average term
premium of only 14 basis points. This term premium is significantly lower than it was
between 1995 and 2011, for example, when it averaged about 1 percent. Mechanically, and
keeping everything else constant, had we assumed the term premium would return to its
1995–2011 average by the end of the medium term, the projection would not imply an
inverted yield curve.
Historically, an inverted yield curve has often signaled an oncoming recession. Indeed, a
yield curve inversion has preceded each of the past seven recessions in the United States.4
However, in many of these instances, the inversion occurred as the FOMC increased the
federal funds rate aggressively, with the goal of curbing significant inflation pressures even
at the cost of a recession.5 In contrast, over the forecast period, inflation is never more than
about 0.1 percentage point above target and the federal funds rate tightening implied by the
assumed policy rule is correspondingly relatively mild.
In the baseline forecast, the inverted yield curve is indeed associated with a period of subpar
growth as the policy rule coaxes the economy toward its longer-run equilibrium, but not
with recession. To be sure, the risk of recession during this period is elevated because a
smaller adverse shock would be sufficient to tip the economy from subpar growth into
outright contraction. But the inverted yield curve that is forecast to prevail during this
period should not be interpreted as an exogenous signal that a recession will mechanically
follow.
4 There also have been inversions that were not followed by a recession.
5 These instances are broadly consistent with the “Romer and Romer dates” as identified in Christina D.
Romer and David H. Romer (1989), “Does Monetary Policy Matter? A New Test in the Spirit of Friedman and
Schwartz,” in Olivier Jean Blanchard and Stanley Fischer, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 4
(Cambridge., Mass.: MIT Press), pp. 121–84; and in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (1994),
“Monetary Policy Matters,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 34 (August), pp. 75–88.

Equity Prices and Home Prices t l
u
O
 Equity prices are revised 4¼ percent higher starting in 2018, in part reflecting &
l
our new tax policy assumptions. Equity prices have probably already been e
v
e
bolstered by the prospects of a corporate tax cut, and we assume some D
n
o
additional increases when the tax package is enacted. However, we view the c
E
scope for further stock price appreciation over the medium term as limited, c
ti
s
and we continue to expect equity values to rise beyond the first quarter of e
m
o
2018 at just below ½ percent per year on average. D
 Incoming data on house prices have been in line with our expectations. With
data through September, we project that house prices will rise 5½ percent this
year before decelerating to an average annual rate of about 4 percent over the
next three years. The ratio of house prices to rents is projected to remain only
marginally above its estimated long-run trend.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 We estimate that real GDP growth in the foreign economies stepped down
from an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 2¼ percent
in the third quarter, ½ percentage point weaker than estimated at the time of
the October Tealbook. With some of this step-down in growth reflecting
temporary factors in Canada and Mexico, growth is expected to rebound to
3 percent in the current quarter. Over the remainder of the medium term,
growth moderates to a pace just under 2¾ percent.
 The broad nominal dollar is down a touch, on net, since the October Tealbook.
Early in the period, more-accommodative-than-expected communications by
AFE central banks boosted the dollar, but the dollar later resumed its
downward trend from earlier in the year. We expect the broad real dollar to
appreciate at an annual rate of 1½ percent over the forecast period as market
expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast. Our
projection for the broad real dollar is about ¾ percent lower by the end of
2020 than in the October Tealbook.
Oil Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil jumped in early November and now stands at
$63, about $5 per barrel higher than at the time of the October Tealbook.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We expect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the second half
of this year, up from 2 percent in the first half. Much of the step-up reflects a rebound in
inventory investment, which was a large drag on GDP growth in the first half and is
projected to boost growth slightly in the second half. Relative to the October Tealbook,
second-half growth is a little slower, reflecting weaker-than-expected data on consumer
spending and net exports.
Within the second half of this year, real GDP rose at a 3¼ percent pace in the
third quarter, and we project a 2¼ percent gain in the fourth quarter.3 Swings in
inventory investment are estimated to have boosted GDP growth ¾ percentage point in
the third quarter, and we expect they will restrain growth by ½ percentage point in the
fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect output to expand at an annual rate
of 2½ percent, similar to the average pace in 2017.
 Real PCE appears on track to rise at a moderate 2½ percent pace over the
second half of the year, somewhat less than in our October Tealbook forecast.
Motor vehicle sales have been boosted by hurricane-related vehicle
replacement demand in recent months, while growth of consumer spending
outside of motor vehicles has been modest. We expect consumer spending to
expand about 2¾ percent in the first quarter of next year, supported in part by
the personal income tax cuts.
3 If not for the hurricanes, the swing in GDP growth between the third and fourth quarters would
have been even larger. We continue to estimate that the effects of the hurricanes held down real GDP
growth ½ percentage point in the third quarter and will boost it ¾ percentage point in the fourth.

 Business investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) appears to be t l
u
O
increasing at an annual rate of 8¾ percent in the second half of this year and
&
7¼ percent for 2017 overall—a marked improvement from flat E&I spending e l
v
e
in 2016. Data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in D
n
September and October were positive, on balance, and recent indicators of o
c
E
business optimism and expected profitability remain upbeat. In contrast, c
ti
s
investment in nonresidential structures appears to be declining in the second e
m
half of the year, as investment in nondrilling structures falls and the recovery o
D
in drilling activity that began last year further subsides. We expect that
overall business fixed investment will continue to expand at a moderate rate in
early 2018, with the tax cuts generating a modest boost to investment through
the medium term.
 Following declines in the second and third quarters of this year, residential
investment is forecast to advance at a 2 percent pace, on average, in the fourth
and first quarters. Over the course of 2017, residential investment has been
held down by higher mortgage interest rates as well as supply constraints
caused by the limited availability of labor and developed lots.
 Net exports have been contributing positively to GDP growth for most of the
year as a result of strong foreign demand and weaker-than-expected import
growth, especially for consumer goods. In the current quarter, net exports are
expected to make a neutral contribution to real GDP growth as import growth
picks up. Next year the net export contribution is also expected to be near
neutral, as the recent strength in imports persists and, supported by recent
dollar depreciation, export growth continues at its 2017 pace.
 Recent indicators of manufacturing activity, including data on October
production and readings from manufacturing surveys, have been upbeat and
point to strong growth of about 6¼ percent at an annual rate in the current
quarter. Much of that strength reflects transitory factors, most notably the
recovery from the hurricanes and a bounceback in motor vehicle assemblies
after a third-quarter lull. With essentially all of the catch-up from the
hurricanes having concluded, we expect growth in manufacturing production
to step down to a moderate pace of about 2 percent in the first quarter.

OOO The Limited Effectiveness of Shale Oil
&&& in Moderating Oil Price Fluctuations
lll
eee
vvv
eee Recent political turmoil in the Middle East has again raised concerns about the stability of global
DDD
oil supplies, pushing up the spot price of oil. In recent years, some commentators have
nnn
ooo
suggested that U.S. shale oil production is flexible enough to moderate, or even neutralize, oil
ccc
EEE
price shocks in the medium term.1 Here we critically examine the hypothesis that shale oil has
ccc
sss
tttiii
altered the perceived persistence of oil price changes.2 We estimate that the co-movement of oil
eee
mmm price futures with the spot price of oil has not declined following the rapid growth of shale
ooo
DDD production, suggesting that the potential buffering effect of shale production might be
overstated, or, at least, that market participants have not yet fully internalized that effect into
their expectations for prices.
The potential for shale oil production to moderate oil price shocks is based on two key
differences between shale and conventional oil production. First, shale oil wells move more
quickly from planning to production than conventional wells. Second, the output of a producing
shale well naturally declines more quickly. As such, with a greater share of production coming
from shale wells, U.S. production can respond more quickly to prices and possibly moderate the
price effects of changes in oil market supply and demand.
As shown in figure 1, shale production has responded to shifts in oil prices, falling back when
prices started declining in mid-2014 and then resuming growth relatively quickly after prices
troughed in early 2016.3
1 This hypothesis is discussed in Spencer Dale (2015), “The New Economics of Oil,” Oxford Institute for Energy
Studies, October, https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-New-Economics-of-
Oil.pdf.
2 The role of the perceived persistence of oil price changes in determining macroeconomic outcomes is
discussed in Sylvain Leduc, Kevin Moran, and Robert Vigfusson (2016), “Learning in the Oil Futures Markets:
Evidence and Macroeconomic Implications,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1179 (Washington: Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2016.1179.
3 As discussed in the June 2017 Tealbook box “Why Is U.S. Oil Output So Strong?,” although the U.S. oil
industry did dramatically reduce the number of operating drilling rigs, strong productivity growth moderated the
decline in shale output.

If market participants perceive that shale oil production largely moderates oil price spikes, then OOOO
oil price changes should be less persistent and farther-dated futures prices should co-move less &&&&
llll
with spot prices. To test this claim, figure 2 reports time-varying estimates of how oil price eeee
vvvv
futures co-move with spot prices.4 In the 2003–14 period, a $1 change in the spot price was eeee

associated with 12-month-ahead futures increasing 75 cents. In mid-2014, the link between spot nnnn
oooo
and futures temporarily weakened but quickly bounced back. The current co-movement is much cccc
EEEE
higher than its average in the 1990s, when oil markets believed that OPEC would stabilize the cccc
ttttiiii
long-term price of oil. eeee ssss
mmmm
oooo
Why has increased shale oil production not made oil price futures less responsive to spot prices? DDDD
One possibility is that shale production is indeed flexible enough to buffer price shocks in the
medium run, but, after a 15-year period when oil prices went from $20 to $145 and then back to
$26 per barrel, market participants are reluctant to believe that longer-term oil prices have
stabilized. Over time, market participants could internalize the increased flexibility of shale
production, disconnecting futures prices from spot prices.
Another possibility is that market participants are accurately assessing the reality that aggregate
shale production is less flexible than boosters would suggest. The flexibility of individual shale oil
wells may not directly scale up to overall production because of industry-wide constraints on
materials, labor, and transportation. For example, to increase production beyond existing
pipeline capacity requires transporting oil by rail, putting an additional $10 wedge per barrel
between wellhead and delivery prices.
Whether shale oil will ultimately prove flexible enough to neutralize the effects of foreign supply
disruptions is yet to be determined and could change over time as the industry evolves,
constraints are relaxed, and new technologies are developed. But at present, even though the
domestic shale oil industry would expand in response to a foreign supply outage, it appears that
markets would expect that expansion to have only a modest effect on global oil prices.5

 Potential GDP growth edges up to 1¾ percent by the end of the medium term.
With real GDP growth expected to outpace potential growth throughout much
of the projection, resource utilization tightens further. In 2019 and 2020, real
GDP is projected to exceed its potential level by around 2¼ percent on
average.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
Since the October Tealbook, labor market conditions have continued to tighten on
balance.4 We expect further tightening over the medium term at a similar pace to the one
in the October Tealbook projection.
 Following an upwardly revised gain of 18,000 in September, total nonfarm
payroll employment rose 261,000 in October, as the labor market largely
recovered from the effects of the hurricanes.5 Excluding those effects, we
estimate that payroll gains averaged around 180,000 over the past three
months and will continue to expand at this pace through the first quarter—
well above the estimates of 80,000 to 120,000 or so per month the staff thinks
would be consistent with unchanged labor market slack. (See the box
“Measuring the Labor Market Using ADP Microdata” for a discussion of
4 The employment report for November will be released on December 8, the Friday before the
FOMC meeting. We will provide a forecast update that afternoon.
5 Given the upward revision to September payrolls and the smaller-than-expected job gains in
October, we now estimate that the hurricanes temporarily depressed payroll employment by 150,000 in
September (about 50,000 less than in the October Tealbook), boosted job gains in October by 100,000 (also
50,000 less than in our earlier projection), and will further boost job gains in November by 50,000. We do
not think that the hurricanes had any material effect on the unemployment and participation rates.

o
D
 The labor force participation rate (LFPR) fell sharply to 62.7 percent in
October, a little below our previous projection. Nevertheless, since the end of
last year and, indeed, for the past several years, the LFPR has essentially
moved sideways, consistent with modest labor market tightening on this
dimension when judged against its declining trend. We expect the LFPR to be
62.8 percent for the remainder of the year and to edge back down to
62.7 percent in the first quarter, about the same as in our previous projection.
 Other labor market data in October were also consistent with further
tightening, including declines in the share of workers who report being
employed part time for economic reasons and the share of the population out
of the labor force but who report wanting a job. These measures have both
fallen on net this year and are near their pre-recession levels.
We have made some small revisions to our aggregate supply assumptions this
round.
 Since the September Tealbook when we last made a small downward
adjustment to the natural rate, the unemployment rate has come in a little
lower than expected, continuing a pattern of surprises seen over the course of
the year on net. Also over the year, core price inflation has been soft, which
seems inconsistent with the additional labor market tightness suggested by the
greater-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate. We have interpreted
this constellation of data as suggesting that the natural rate is slightly lower

Measuring the Labor Market Using ADP Microdata
&&&
lll
eee
vvv A key challenge for both policymakers and staff is to gauge the current state of the
eee
DDD
macroeconomy, including the labor market. The payroll employment series from the Bureau
nnn
ooo of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Employment Statistics (CES) program is one of the most
ccc
EEE
carefully constructed measures of labor market activity, but even this series is subject to
ccc
tttiii sampling and nonsampling errors.1 Indeed, the 90 percent confidence interval around the
sss
eee
mmm monthly change in private payroll employment is +/– 111,000 due to sampling error alone.
ooo
Moreover, the variation of actual (preliminary‐to‐benchmark) revisions to this series since
DDD
2003, which reflects both some sampling and some nonsampling errors, is even larger than
would be implied by the sampling‐based confidence interval. New sources of labor market
data offer an opportunity to complement official statistics and to produce more timely,
accurate, and detailed analyses of labor market activity. In this regard, the Board’s staff has
been working with data from the payroll‐processing company ADP that cover 20 percent of
the private workforce and are available weekly in near real time.2
The BLS and ADP data are both based on large samples of firms that cover roughly equal
fractions of private payroll employment. The BLS measure is based on a probability sample of
establishments.3 In contrast, the ADP data set consists of the firms that hire ADP to manage
their payrolls, which may introduce sample selection issues. These potential selection issues
are reduced to some extent by the fact that we reweight the ADP data by establishment size
and industry to match the characteristics of the universe of firms along these dimensions.
Reassuringly, our ADP employment index (the black line shown in figure 1) has a similar mean
and variance to, and is highly correlated with, the BLS series (the red line).
Figure 1: BLS and ADP Monthly Employment Growth
1 Sampling error arises because the estimate of payroll employment is based on responses from a
sample of employers, not a census. Nonsampling error arises because of issues such as respondent errors,
errors in data processing, and bias due to nonresponse.
2 One existing use of ADP data is ADP’s monthly National Employment Report (NER). The NER
forecasts BLS payroll employment changes using a combination of ADP‐derived data and other publicly
available data. By contrast, our primary goal in using the ADP microdata is to produce an estimate of
employment changes independent from the BLS payroll series as well as other data sources.
3 The BLS payroll series is benchmarked annually to administrative data, which increases the
reliability of the historical series. However, the administrative data are available only with several months’
delay.

The ADP data have several useful properties. First, the data cover each week of the month, so &&&&
llll
the ADP index captures employment developments for the month as a whole, whereas the eeee
vvvv
BLS series covers only the pay period including the 12th of the month. Second, our ADP eeee
DDDD
employment index helps predict BLS employment changes in real time, even after accounting nnnn
oooo
for private forecaster expectations and other standard indicators. Third, the ADP index is cccc
EEEE
useful for dealing with a particular anomaly of the BLS data: In recent years, the first BLS cccc
ttttiiii
estimate of employment changes for August has tended to be too low and has subsequently eeee ssss
mmmm
been revised upward, while the ADP index does not have this bias. Finally, the ADP data can
oooo
be updated every week and include full geographic detail. This timeliness and detail allow DDDD
better analysis of transitory or localized events such as storms. The staff has already started
to incorporate such insights in its assessment of the labor market, including when estimating
the effects of the recent hurricanes.
A natural question is whether we can create a more precise estimate of employment growth
by pooling the information in the BLS and ADP payroll employment data. In preliminary work,
we combine the information in the two series using a statistical tool called the Kalman filter.
The resultant measure of underlying employment growth is the blue line in figure 2, plotted
along with the model‐based confidence interval. A similar exercise that excludes ADP data
and only uses BLS data yields a confidence interval that is about 20 percent wider. The Kalman
filter places roughly equal weight on the BLS series and the ADP series, which is consistent
with the fact that ADP and BLS cover roughly equal‐sized samples from the establishment
population.4
These results are encouraging in their own right. Moreover, they point to the possibility of
even greater gains if information from other large payroll‐processing companies could be
incorporated into the estimates as well. Over the coming years, we are hopeful that ever‐
expanding technological possibilities combined with a rise in the availability of private data will
continue to improve economic measurement.
Figure 2: Combining BLS and ADP Monthly Employment Changes with the Kalman Filter
4 For comparison, the same exercise with the BLS payroll employment series and the employment
series from the household survey (adjusted to match the scope of the payroll series) puts a weight of well
over 90 percent on the payroll series.

structural productivity slightly through greater capital deepening, and that the o

cut to personal income taxes will increase potential labor supply through a

We continue to expect the labor market to tighten further through 2019.
 The unemployment rate is projected to decline more gradually going forward
than it has this year, reaching 3.5 percent in 2019 and remaining at that level
in 2020—0.1 percentage point below the previous Tealbook. However, with
the 0.1 percentage point downward revision to the natural rate, at the end of
the medium term the difference between the natural and actual unemployment
rates is the same as in the October Tealbook.
 Total payroll employment gains are expected to slow from an average
monthly pace of about 175,000 this year and next to 150,000 in 2019 and
120,000 in 2020.
 Over the medium term, the LFPR edges down a little more slowly than its
trend, as sustained job gains and rising real wages continue to draw
individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows, ending 2020
0.4 percentage point above our estimate of its trend level. Compared with the
October Tealbook, the LFPR is a touch higher in the medium term, reflecting
the labor supply response to the cut in personal income taxes.
 We project that labor productivity in the business sector will increase about
1 percent per year over the forecast period—slightly less than our estimate of
6 In addition to our revision to the natural rate, we made a small downward adjustment to our
estimate of the trend growth rate of output per hour for the economy as a whole in 2017.

e THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
D
n
o
c Although core PCE inflation in September and October came in a little above our
E
c
ti expectations, inflation has remained subdued overall, with total PCE prices increasing
s
e
m 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in October and core prices rising 1.4 percent. We
o
D continue to expect the transitory factors that have held down inflation this year to largely
dissipate next year.
 We project core PCE prices to increase 0.1 percent per month in November
and December—held down by the residual seasonality that we think still
affects data in these months—and 0.2 percent per month on average in the
first quarter. We project the 12-month change in core PCE prices to fluctuate
around its current level until March of next year when it will step up to
1.7 percent, as the unusual decline in core prices seen this past March drops
out of the calculation.8
 Since the October Tealbook, gasoline and oil prices have increased, boosting
our near-term projection for PCE energy prices and thus total PCE price
inflation. We now expect the 12-month change in total PCE prices to move
between 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent in the next several months, up about
0.2 percentage point since our previous projection.
 Core import prices are expected to rise 2 percent at an annual rate in the
second half of this year. This pace is a bit faster than earlier in the year but
slower than we expected in the October Tealbook, reflecting both weaker-
than-expected incoming data and lower nonfuel commodity prices. Import
price inflation is expected to slow to a ¾ percent pace in the medium term,
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly because workers hired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to
workers hired during a slack labor market.
8 The unusually large decline in wireless telephone plan prices that occurred in March 2017 held
down that month’s core PCE reading about 0.1 percentage point. Other components also contributed to the
low reading in core PCE inflation in that month.

consistent with still-moderate foreign inflation, a gradually appreciating t l

dollar, and slowly declining commodity prices.
&
l
e
v
 Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved e
D
little since October on balance. Median 10-year inflation expectations for n
o
c
PCE prices in the fourth-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters were E
c
stable at 2.0 percent, the median of expectations over the next 5 to 10 years s
ti
e
m
from the Michigan survey edged down to 2.4 percent in November, and the
o
D
3-year-ahead measure of inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was unchanged in October at
2.8 percent. Similarly, market-based measures, such as the TIPS-based
measure of 5-to-10-year forward inflation compensation, were relatively
stable during the intermeeting period.
Core PCE price inflation is projected to move up to 1.8 percent in 2018, mainly
reflecting the abating of this year’s surprising weakness. Core price inflation then moves
up further, to 2 percent in 2019 and 2020, as continued tightening in resource utilization
and a gradual increase in our judgmental underlying inflation trend more than offset an
increasing drag from core import prices.9 Total PCE price inflation also rises in the
medium term, from 1.7 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2019 and then to 2.0 percent in
2020. Relative to the October Tealbook, the forecast for core PCE price inflation is up
0.1 percentage point this year and is unrevised over the medium term. Total PCE price
inflation is up 0.2 percentage point this year and essentially unrevised over the
medium term.
9 In light of this year’s surprisingly low inflation, in this forecast we have slightly pushed back the
upward drift in our estimate of underlying inflation. (We define underlying inflation to be the level that we
estimate inflation would return to in the absence of upward or downward pressure from resource utilization
or supply shocks, and which we think is ultimately determined by the inflation expectations of wage and
price setters.) We now assume that underlying PCE inflation remains at 1.8 percent in 2018—the same as
in 2017 and previous years—and starts to edge up thereafter, reaching 1.9 percent in 2020; in previous
projections it started to edge up in 2018 and reached 1.9 percent in 2019. This revision resulted in no
perceptible changes to our forecast for core PCE inflation in the medium term. For 2018, our reaction to
this year’s low inflation had already been built into the forecast. For 2019, the small downward revision to
trend was offset by other small influences.

The data on labor compensation received since the October Tealbook have been t l
u
O
mixed, with some measures showing signs of mild acceleration relative to a few
&
years ago. e l
v
e
D
n
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose o
c
E
2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in October, well below the elevated
c
ti
reading in September; while we had viewed the September reading as s
e
m
transitory, we were nevertheless surprised to the downside by the October o
D
data.10 We expect the 12-month change to pick up to 2¾ percent over the next
couple of quarters, a pace similar to 2016 and above the roughly 2 percent
average seen earlier in the expansion.
 Compensation per hour in the business sector—an extremely volatile series—
is estimated to have risen 1.0 percent over the four quarters through 2017:Q3,
below our estimate in the October Tealbook, reflecting sizable downward
revisions to compensation in the second and third quarters of this year.
Hourly labor compensation growth is projected to step up from an average
pace of around 2¼ percent over the past five years to about 3½ percent in each
of the next three years amid tight labor market conditions.
 The employment cost index rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in
September, a touch more than we expected, and has shown some acceleration
relative to its pace in recent years.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was
3.4 percent in October, also about the same pace as a year ago but up from
earlier years.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 In the longer-run projection, the natural rate of unemployment holds steady at
its slightly downward revised level of 4.7 percent. We continue to assume
that long-run potential GDP growth will be 1.7 percent.
10 Average hourly earnings in September rose substantially, which we think in part reflected a
temporary shift in employment away from lower-wage workers due to the hurricanes. This effect was
unwound in October when these workers returned to payrolls.

t l  We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds

rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. While some of the

s  We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
e

put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
o
D
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by late 2021.
 Real GDP growth slows further to about 1¼ percent in 2021 and remains
around that pace through 2023. The unemployment rate moves up from
3.5 percent in 2020 to 3.7 percent in 2021 and rises gradually toward its
assumed natural rate in subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up a bit to 2.1 percent in 2021 and hovers slightly
above the Committee’s long-run objective for several years before edging
back down to 2 percent.
 With output materially above its potential level and inflation a bit over the
Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about
1¾ percentage points above its long-run value of 2.5 percent in 2021. It
moves back toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign GDP growth stepped down from a strong annual rate of 3 percent in the
second quarter to an estimated 2¼ percent in the third, mainly reflecting a contraction in
Mexico induced by its recent hurricane and earthquakes and a slowing in the red-hot pace
of activity in Canada. Largely because of an expected rebound in Mexican activity,
foreign growth is projected to bounce back to 3 percent in the current quarter.
Subsequently, foreign growth is projected to stabilize around its potential pace of just
below 2¾ percent in 2018 and over the remainder of the forecast period. Even though
k
growth abroad remains at about potential, we see the foreign recovery becoming more o
o
l
self-sustained, allowing for the gradual normalization of monetary policy. On balance, t
u
O
this projection is little changed from the October Tealbook. &
l
e
v
e
Despite a boost from recent increases in crude oil prices, inflation in the advanced D
n
foreign economies (AFEs) is expected to remain muted. In the euro area and Japan, o
c
E
inflation is projected to remain below target over the forecast period, creeping up to
l
’
t
n
1¾ percent and just above 1 percent, respectively, by 2020. In the United Kingdom, as I
the effects of past currency depreciation wear off, inflation is projected to slow from
2¾ percent in the current quarter to the 2 percent target by the end of the forecast period.
In Canada, inflation is expected to rise from 1.2 percent in the third quarter to just under
2½ percent in 2018, boosted by higher oil prices and a tight labor market, before
declining to target by 2020.
With prospects for a sustained pickup in underlying inflation still uncertain,
especially in the euro area and Japan, we expect that AFE central banks will maintain
accommodative policies. Although the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the Bank of England
(BOE) have begun withdrawing stimulus, both central banks are expected to proceed
cautiously with further policy normalization.
Developments in oil markets, however, could upset our projection of only gradual
increases in interest rates abroad. For example, an escalation of geopolitical tensions in
the Middle East could lead to a much sharper increase in oil prices than the moderate rise
observed to date. In the context of tight labor markets, such an increase could further
boost headline and core inflation, possibly prompting a quicker normalization of
monetary policy in the AFEs and a tightening of global financial conditions. We discuss

such a situation in the “Higher Oil Prices and Faster Advanced Foreign Economy
Tightening” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Global financial conditions could also tighten as a result of spillovers from
adverse developments in China, a risk that is magnified by how surprisingly quiescent
global financial markets have been lately. We explore this possibility in the “China-
Driven Emerging Market Economy Turbulence” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty
section.

The BOC, which raised its overnight rate target from ½ percent to 1 percent earlier
in 2017, signaled that it will be cautious about future rate hikes, pointing to elevated
uncertainty about potential output, the dynamics of wage and price inflation, and the
sensitivity of highly indebted households to higher interest rates. Accordingly, we
now expect the BOC to wait until early 2018 to tighten policy further, one quarter
later than assumed in the October Tealbook.
• Euro area. Real GDP grew 2.5 percent in the third quarter, supported by solid
domestic and foreign demand. More-recent indicators, such as PMIs and economic
sentiment, suggest that activity will expand at a similar pace in the current quarter.
Growth is projected to slow to 1¾ percent by mid-2018 and remain at that pace,
slightly above potential growth, through 2020. Compared with the October Tealbook,
this outlook is about ¼ percentage point stronger in the current quarter as a result of
stronger-than-expected incoming data and a touch weaker in 2018 largely because of
higher oil prices.
Data through November suggest that core inflation declined from 1.4 percent in the
third quarter to ¼ percent in the current quarter, partly reflecting one-off changes in
service prices. Even so, headline inflation should edge up to 1½ percent in the

current quarter as a result of higher retail energy prices, and we see it reaching
1¾ percent by 2020 as the output gap closes. Given the subdued inflation outlook,
the European Central Bank (ECB) announced on October 26 its intention to continue
purchasing assets at least through September 2018, albeit at a reduced pace of
€30 billion per month starting in January 2018. We expect the ECB to wait until
late 2018 to end its purchases and until mid-2019 to start hiking its policy rates.
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth increased from about 1 percent in the first half
of 2017 to 1.6 percent in the third quarter, largely reflecting a strong pickup in private
consumption growth. Based on better-than-expected incoming data—including
PMIs, consumer confidence, and retail sales through October—we project that growth
k
o
will edge up slightly to 1¾ percent in the current quarter. Thereafter, growth should o
l
t
u
remain near this pace, supported by accommodative monetary policy. O
&

We expect inflation to rise to 2¾ percent in the current quarter before gradually v

on November 2 but also signaled a very gradual pace of tightening over the next few t ’

years, partly because of concerns about downside risks from Brexit. In line with this
guidance, we now see the policy rate rising to only 1.25 percent by the end of 2020,
¼ percentage point less than assumed in the October Tealbook.
• Japan. Real GDP growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the third quarter, still well above
our potential growth estimate of ¾ percent. Based on solid recent data, including
exports for October and PMIs through November, we expect growth to remain just
below 1½ percent in the current quarter before slowing to a more sustainable
1 percent pace in 2018. In line with recent news, we now assume that proceeds of the
2019 tax hike—rather than being used exclusively to reduce the deficit—will partly
fund new childcare and education programs. Accordingly, we revised our growth
forecast up a touch to ¼ percent in 2019 and to ¾ percent in 2020.
Inflation turned positive in the third quarter, with both overall and core consumer
prices rising at a modest 0.4 percent annual rate. Elevated resource utilization should
push up inflation further over the forecast period, though only to about 1 percent,
given that inflation expectations remain well below the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent
target. Against this background, we continue to assume that monetary policy will
remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• Mexico. After growing a paltry 1.1 percent in the second quarter, real GDP
contracted 1¼ percent in the third quarter as two major earthquakes and a hurricane
significantly disrupted economic activity. This estimate is about 2¾ percentage
points below our October Tealbook projection. As temporary disruptions from these
natural disasters unwind and reconstruction gets under way, growth is projected to
rebound to 3½ percent in the current quarter. Thereafter, we expect diminishing
fiscal drag, past reforms in the energy sector, and monetary easing to support real
GDP growth at an average pace of around 2¾ percent over the forecast period.
However, uncertainties stemming from the July 2018 presidential election and the
k
o
o NAFTA renegotiation process present downside risks to growth.
l
t
u
O
& Headline inflation eased from 6.9 percent in the second quarter to a still-high
l
e
v 5.1 percent in the third. Highlighting risks of another pickup in inflation, the Bank of
e
D
Mexico kept its policy rate unchanged at 7 percent at its November meeting, the last
n
o
c meeting before Alejandro Díaz de León succeeds Agustín Carstens as governor. As
E
l
t ’ inflation falls further to just above 3 percent in 2018, the Bank of Mexico is projected
n
I
to begin reducing its policy rate gradually in mid-2018.
• Brazil. The recovery from Brazil’s long and deep recession remains very weak. Real
GDP growth slowed from 2.7 percent in the second quarter to 0.6 percent in the third;
a strong rebound in imports more than offset the boost to GDP from improving
domestic demand. We expect growth to pick up to a still-tepid 2 percent pace
in 2018, supported by substantial monetary policy easing but held back by political
uncertainty, household and corporate deleveraging, and fiscal retrenchment.
As drag from earlier declines in food prices fades, inflation is projected to rise from
2¼ percent in the second and third quarters to 3¾ percent in the fourth. With
inflation still below the central bank’s current target of 4½ percent and domestic
demand recovering very slowly, we expect the central bank to cut its policy rate
50 basis points to 7 percent at its December meeting, bringing the cumulative
reduction in the policy rate since October 2016 to 7½ percentage points.
• Venezuela. Amid economic freefall, soaring inflation, and inadequate international
reserves, Venezuela has struggled to service its sovereign and state-owned oil
enterprise bonds. The current situation is murky; there are reports that some bond
Page 44 of 126

--- Page 48 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) December 1, 2017
payments have been made with significant delays, but other payments remain
overdue. These payment delays beyond grace periods led credit agencies to
downgrade some bond ratings to “selective default.” So far, Venezuela’s travails
have generated little spillover to global markets.
• China. Recent data have been mixed. Although indicators have softened in some
sectors, such as manufacturing and construction, other data, such as PMIs and retail
sales, suggest that the overall pace of growth is holding up. All told, we expect real
GDP to grow 6½ percent in the fourth quarter, little changed from its third-quarter
pace but down from 7 percent during the first half. We continue to see growth
slowing further, reaching 5¾ percent by 2020.
k
o
o
l
t
We see headline inflation rising from 2 percent in the third quarter to 3 percent in the u
O
fourth, primarily because of rising food and energy prices. As the temporary boost &
l
e
from commodity prices fades, inflation is projected to settle around 2½ percent v
e
D
in 2018 and stay there over the remainder of the forecast period.
n

E
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth rose from 4.1 percent in the second quarter l
’
t
n
to 5.1 percent in the third, mainly driven by stronger exports to China and to the I
United States as well as a pickup in domestic consumption. With export and PMI
indicators pointing to a modest slowdown in Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, we
expect growth in emerging Asia excluding China to slow to 4¼ percent in the current
quarter. Thereafter, growth is projected to gradually decline to about 3½ percent
by 2020, as Chinese imports slow, the global trade boom moderates, and monetary
policy becomes less accommodative.

Financial Market Developments
Over the intermeeting period, the nominal Treasury yield curve flattened, as
short-dated yields increased notably while long-dated yields moved up only slightly. The
Treasury Department’s quarterly refunding statement and the Treasury Borrowing
Advisory Committee recommendation that pointed to increased issuance of short-dated
securities were reportedly seen as the main drivers behind the rise in short-dated Treasury
yields. FOMC communications and slightly stronger-than-expected economic data
releases have reinforced market expectations for a December rate hike. As the likelihood
of the passage of U.S. tax legislation increased, broad equity price indexes rose modestly.
The dollar weakened moderately against a broad basket of currencies.
 The market-implied probability of a rate hike at the December FOMC meeting
rose slightly to a level of near certainty. A straight read of market quotes
implies that a further rate hike is fully priced in for the first half of 2018,
while a staff model that adjusts for term premiums suggests that market
participants may be expecting two rate hikes in that period.
 The 2-year Treasury yield rose 20 basis points over the intermeeting period,
and the 10-year yield edged up 6 basis points. TIPS-based measures of
inflation compensation were little changed on net. s

reinforcing the perceived likelihood of an increase in the target range for the federal
funds rate at the December meeting. Domestic economic data releases, on balance, came
in slightly stronger than anticipated. In particular, market participants highlighted the
October CPI release, which was seen as consistent with a modest and sustained
strengthening in inflation.
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts suggests that the
probability that market participants attach to a rate hike at the upcoming FOMC meeting
edged up to around 95 percent. Beyond the current year, a straight read of OIS-implied
federal funds rates suggests that one rate hike is fully priced in for the first half of 2018,
while a staff model that adjusts for term premiums implies two rate hikes in that period.
Overall, implied rates at the end of 2018 and 2019 moved up somewhat.
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened over the intermeeting period, as yields
on 2-year nominal Treasury securities rose 20 basis points and 10-year yields edged up
6 basis points. The spread between 10- and 2-year Treasury yields narrowed to 64 basis
points, its lowest level since 2007. Short-dated Treasury yields rose and the yield curve
flattened following the November 1 release of the Treasury’s quarterly refunding
statement and the recommendation by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee that
the Treasury increase the issuance of short-dated securities while maintaining recent
longer-term issuance levels. We attribute the flattening of the yield curve over the
intermeeting period mostly to these releases. Incoming economic data, on net, have s

The Flattening of the U.S. Yield Curve since December 2015
On balance since the FOMC began its current tightening cycle in December 2015,
the 2-year nominal Treasury yield (the red line in figure 1) has risen about 70 basis
points while the 10-year yield (the blue line) is little changed, leaving the spread
between these yields (the green line) at its lowest level since 2007.1 This analysis
puts this flattening of the Treasury yield curve into historical perspective,
discusses factors that appear to explain these movements in yields, and then
describes the signal that may be taken for real economic activity in the near term.
Although the recent flattening of the yield curve has attracted significant
attention by market participants, the current spread between 10- and 2-year
yields, seen in figure 2, is not unusually low by historical standards—it stands at
about the 40th percentile of its distribution since August 1971. In addition, the
extent of the recent narrowing of the spread since December 2015 has been
smaller than that observed at a comparable stage in three previous tightening
cycles (figure 3).2
Separate factors appear to explain the recent movements at the short and long
ends of the yield curve since liftoff. The increase in short-term yields has

1 The spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate—an
alternative measure of the slope of the yield curve that is used in the staff’s baseline economic
projections—has similarly declined.
2 The three previous tightening cycles began in 1988, 1994, and 2004. Of course, this
sample is small and each cycle had different characteristics, which makes a direct comparison
with the current cycle difficult. For example, the current cycle has been characterized by a
relatively gradual pace of rate increases. How one dates the start of each cycle also matters
for comparison purposes. For example, the dashed green line in figure 3 shows the cumulative
change in the spread since December 2016, a period that more closely resembles previous
cycles.

reflected the gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation over this
period as well as expectations for continued removal over the near term. At the
same time, other factors appear to have held down longer-term yields.3 There is
some evidence that expectations of the longer-run equilibrium real interest rate,
or r *, may have fallen: A Blue Chip survey-based measure of 5-to-10-year-ahead
real rate expectations has moved down by about 30 basis points since the end of
2015, many model-based estimates of r * have remained persistently low relative
to pre-crisis levels, and survey expectations of longer-run GDP growth have also
declined.4 Furthermore, spillovers from unconventional monetary policies
abroad, particularly in the euro area and Japan, also seem likely to have put some
downward pressure on the term premium component of longer-term Treasury
yields over this period. Indeed, since December 2015, staff estimates of the
10-year term premium have declined about 30 basis points.
More recently this year, market commentaries have pointed to two additional
factors that may have contributed to the flattening of the yield curve. First,
investors appear to have revised down their expectations for expansionary U.S.
fiscal policy amid slower-than-expected progress with the Administration’s
legislative agenda; this factor has reportedly led to some unwinding of the
steepening of the yield curve seen immediately following the U.S. election late
last year. Second, the generally weaker-than-expected incoming inflation data

3 For a more detailed discussion of factors holding down longer-dated yields, see the
memo to the FOMC titled “Recent Movements in Longer-Term Treasury Yields: Causes and
Potential Policy Implications,” by the staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, dated July 14, 2017.
4 The Monetary Policy Strategies section in the October 2017 Tealbook discussed a
range of recent time-series estimates of r* and showed that they are subject to sizable
uncertainty. The median respondent to the November 2017 Survey of Primary Dealers
expected “longer run” growth of 1.8 percent, down from 2.1 percent in the December 2015
survey.

this year may have led some investors to assess a higher risk of continued low
inflation. TIPS-based measures of 5-to-10-year inflation compensation have
declined 14 basis points, on net, this year though they remain slightly higher than
in December 2015, and both survey- and model-based estimates of long-term
inflation expectations are generally little changed over these periods.
A large empirical literature has documented that the slope of the yield curve
helps predict real economic activity.5 We look at two regression models that are
typical of this literature: One examines the signal from the current spread
between the 10- and 2-year yields for near-term growth of real GDP; the other
uses that spread to estimate the probability that the economy will enter a
recession during the coming year. As shown in figure 4, the results indicate that
the current slope of the yield curve is historically associated with 2.5 percent real
GDP growth over the coming year (the red line) and a 15 percent probability that
the economy will be in an NBER recession a year from now (the blue line), about
30 basis points lower and 10 percentage points higher, respectively, than in
December 2015.
There may be reasons why the results of these simple models should not be
interpreted as pointing to a deterioration in near-term growth prospects.
Estimates of the term premium component of longer-dated yields have declined
steadily in recent decades, and so the information content of the slope of the
yield curve on future economic activity may have changed over time. Such a
decline implies that, all else being equal, the same economic outlook would be
associated with a flatter yield curve. (See the box “Why Is the Yield Curve
Inverted in the Tealbook Projection?” in the Domestic Economic Developments
s and Outlook section of this Tealbook for a discussion of the effect of the decline
t
e
k in the term premium on the staff forecast.)

a
l In addition, information from surveys and movements in other asset prices do

not point to a notable deterioration in investors’ growth outlook since liftoff. For
n
a example, the expected GDP growth over the next four quarters for the median
n
Fi
respondent to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers has only declined modestly
since December 2015, from 2.6 percent then to 2.2 percent in the most recent
(October to November) survey. Furthermore, the median probability of a
recession in six months’ time in the Desk survey has remained unchanged over
this period at 10 percent. Finally, movements in risky asset prices since December
2015, including rising equity prices and narrowing corporate credit spreads (not
shown), could suggest that investors have become more, not less, optimistic
about near-term growth prospects over this period. That said, past recessions
have proved difficult to foresee, and the staff will continue to closely monitor the
yield curve and any signals it may contain for future economic growth.

a Predictor of U.S. Recessions,” Current Issues in Economics and Finance, vol. 2 (June), pp. 1–6.

participants did not attribute any price action to the implementation of reductions in
reinvestments.1
Broad stock price indexes moved up about 3 percent, reflecting in part increased
expectations for the passage of U.S. tax legislation. In particular, the average stock prices
of firms that recently had high effective tax rates notably outperformed those of firms
with low effective tax rates. One-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500
index—the VIX—ticked up a bit but remained near the very low end of its historical
range.
Spreads of yields on triple-B-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over
yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed, but spreads on
speculative-grade bonds issued by companies in the telecommunications sector widened
somewhat. Corporate bond spreads remained below their historical median levels,
particularly for speculative-grade bonds, whose spreads ended the period at about the
10th percentile of their historical distribution.
Foreign Developments
Since the previous FOMC meeting, foreign financial markets have been generally
quiet. The dollar resumed the downward trend that has been evident over most of 2017,
and AFE yield curves flattened slightly. Movements in risky asset prices were limited.

increases are likely to be gradual and limited, and the BOE also emphasized Brexit-
related risks. The BOE communications initially weighed on U.K. yields and the British
pound, but these moves later retraced when U.K. and EU officials moved closer to an
agreement over the amount that the United Kingdom will pay to settle its obligations for
Brexit.
On balance, AFE equity price indexes have declined a touch since the FOMC
meeting, while emerging market equity indexes have changed little on net. Venezuela
was assigned selective default status by S&P and Fitch following the expiration of the
30-day grace period for its coupon payments due in October. The International Swaps
and Derivatives Association also declared both Venezuela and the state-owned oil giant
PDVSA in default, potentially triggering payouts on related credit default swaps.
Venezuelan spreads have widened notably, but spillovers to other markets have been
minimal, as some form of default was widely expected. Emerging market sovereign
spreads were little changed, and net flows to emerging market funds remained positive.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Conditions in short-term unsecured funding markets remained stable over the
intermeeting period. The effective federal funds rate held steady at 1.16 percent
excluding the month-end and was closely tracked by the overnight Eurodollar rate.

which were 2 basis points and 7 basis points higher than those over the previous

$84 billion lower than that over the previous intermeeting period. While money market

and dealer balance sheet reductions ahead of the year-end.

funds (MMFs) reduced their take-up of ON RRPs markedly, they increased their holdings
of short-term Treasury bills and private repos, continuing a trend seen since August of
this year. Total MMF assets under management increased slightly.
In the near term, the Treasury is expected to reduce net bill issuance to prepare for
the end of the debt limit suspension period on December 8. After that time, the staff
estimates that the Treasury can use the cash it has on hand and extraordinary measures to
operate without breaching the debt ceiling until February or early March of 2018.
To date, the change in the Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policy has not been
associated with significant changes in banks’ holdings of securities or reserve balances,
reflecting the limited runoff of SOMA securities holdings since the balance sheet
normalization program began on October 1.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for businesses and households were little changed over the
intermeeting period and continued to be broadly supportive of growth in spending
and investment.
• Financing flows to nonfinancial firms through capital markets remained
robust. In contrast, banks’ lending to businesses moderated, as both C&I and
CRE loan growth declined. Despite tepid loan growth so far this year, higher
interest rates charged on business loans have supported bank profitability.
• Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained
accommodative for most borrowers, while credit standards for those with low
credit scores continued to loosen gradually from tight levels.
• Consumer credit growth picked up modestly in the third quarter compared
with previous quarters. Financing conditions remained largely
accommodative, particularly for consumers with strong credit histories.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
Over the intermeeting period, financing conditions for large nonfinancial
corporations through capital markets remained accommodative on balance. After a
typically slow October, gross issuance of corporate bonds strengthened in November,
driven by investment-grade offerings. In the institutional leveraged loan market, issuance
rose sharply in November to a level in line with the first quarter of this year, as borrowers
took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance their debt. Net commercial
paper issuance by nonfinancial companies rebounded in October after a typical quarter-
end drop and was slightly negative in November. Gross equity issuance in October and
November has been solid, as the volume of initial public offerings has exceeded the s
n
o
average volume seen in the previous quarter, and seasoned equity issuance was close to ti
di
its average pace of the past few years. The volume of completed M&A deals picked up n
o
C
in the third quarter from its already robust pace in the second quarter. In contrast, share
g
n
repurchases continued to decline in the third quarter, reportedly reflecting high stock ci

market valuations and a growing appetite for capital expenditures. n

Growth of bank-intermediated credit to nonfinancial firms, however, was tepid in
October and November. In particular, C&I loan growth declined relative to the third
quarter, primarily reflecting a contraction in domestic loans held by foreign banks.
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations was little changed over
the intermeeting period and appeared to remain solid. The volume of nonfinancial
corporate bond rating upgrades roughly matched that of downgrades in October, but
upgrades have trailed downgrades notably thus far in November. In October, the six-
month trailing bond default rate remained near its lowest level since 2014, while the
November expected year-ahead default rate for all firms is projected to stay only a bit
higher than the midpoint of its range seen during nonrecessionary periods even as
aggregate leverage in the corporate sector remained elevated.
The third-quarter corporate earnings season drew to a close over the intermeeting
period, and the reports for the quarter were generally consistent with the strong
expectations of Wall Street analysts. Despite some notable losses in the insurance sector,
which were partly due to recent hurricanes and other natural disasters, earnings per share
for S&P 500 firms are estimated to have increased about 5 percent from the second
quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. The outlook for corporate earnings appears to
have remained favorable, as the strong year-ahead projections by Wall Street analysts
have been revised slightly higher.
Small Businesses
Overall, small business financing conditions appeared to have remained favorable
over the intermeeting period. Small business lending activity has slowed modestly in
recent months, and data from the Wells Fargo Small Business Index (WFSBI) survey for
the fourth quarter suggest that this slowdown is due to weak loan demand among small
business owners. With respect to credit supply, the fraction of respondents in the WFSBI
survey who reported difficulty in obtaining credit over the past 12 months reached a new
post-crisis low in the fourth quarter, and the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices showed some net easing of standards and narrowing of

Financing conditions for CRE remained accommodative over the intermeeting
period. CRE financing from capital markets remained more robust than that from banks,
as CMBS were issued at a somewhat faster pace in the third quarter relative to the same
period last year. Spreads on CMBS remained toward the lower end of the range seen
since the financial crisis. Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools continued to
decline in October, largely reflecting the shrinking share of loans that were originated
before the financial crisis, which have much higher-than-average delinquency rates.
That said, the growth of CRE loans held by banks continued to decline in October
and November. This slowdown has been concentrated at the largest banks, especially in
the multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loan categories; CRE loan growth at smaller
banks has remained strong overall and even accelerated a bit in October. In addition,
new CRE mortgages funded by insurance companies remained soft in the third quarter
following a drop in the second quarter, consistent with anecdotal reports that insurance
companies are pulling back a bit from lending to this sector.
Banking Conditions
Despite the slowdown in core loan growth, net interest margins at banks, a
measure of lending profitability, ticked up in the third quarter. So far this year, much of
the boost to net interest margins has come from increased loan income from higher
interest rates, especially on business loans with floating interest rates. While the cost of
funding at banks has also increased this year, especially for nondeposit sources of bank
financing, the additional income generated by loans and other assets has served to offset
banks’ higher funding costs.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Financing conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative over
the intermeeting period, on balance, and Puerto Rico’s ongoing financial distress
continued to have little effect on the broader municipal bond market. Gross issuance of
s
municipal bonds was strong in October and the first few weeks of November. The credit n
o
ti
quality of general obligation (GO) bonds remained stable, with the number of ratings di

HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained
accommodative for most borrowers. Loan growth in the banking sector remained at a
pace above that seen in the first half of the year, although it declined in October and
November relative to the third quarter. More broadly, mortgage originations for home
purchases rose in October, presumably as the drag on housing demand from the rise in
mortgage rates toward the end of last year waned further. The rate on 30-year
conforming mortgages offered to well-qualified borrowers continued to hover around
4 percent, which is quite low by historical standards. Credit standards are still tight for
borrowers with low credit scores and hard-to-document incomes but have been loosening
gradually for borrowers with low credit scores.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely
accommodative overall. Consumer credit has been readily available at relatively
attractive terms to borrowers with strong credit histories, but conditions for borrowers
with subprime credit scores remained tight in credit card markets and continued to tighten
for auto loans. Indeed, credit bureau data indicate that new loan extensions to subprime
borrowers fell over the past several quarters for auto loans and flattened this year for
credit cards. Consistent with these developments, average credit scores for new and used
auto loans stayed higher than a year ago, and credit card limits for borrowers with
subprime credit scores remained at historically low levels.
Total consumer credit, driven mostly by robust credit expansion in September,
expanded at a slightly faster pace in the third quarter compared to previous quarters. It is
possible that this recent increase in consumer credit growth reflected sizable hurricane-
related borrowing by households in the affected areas, although preliminary staff analysis
has found only weak evidence to support this view. ABS issuance funding consumer
loans was robust in recent months and a bit ahead of last year’s pace, and ABS spreads

Risks and Uncertainty tt

ee
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS nn cc
UU
&&
As in the October Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of ss
kk
ss
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark RRii
used by the FOMC. Many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted as
reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued. For example, corporate bond
spreads and the VIX continue to be near the low end of their historical ranges. At the
same time, considerable uncertainty exists about the future direction of a number of
federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook.
We continue to judge the risks around our projections for both real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as being balanced. Consistent with that view, estimates of the
distribution of risks around those forecasts conditional on available indicators, shown in
the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly skewed.
Moreover, as presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the risk of
returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three years is
estimated from stochastic simulations in the FRB/US model to be about 14 percent.1
With regard to inflation, we still see the current level of uncertainty around our
projection as in line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside
and upside as roughly balanced. This assessment is consistent with the estimates of the
time-varying risks for the inflation forecast, as shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying
Macroeconomic Risk.” To the downside, this year’s string of soft readings on inflation
could prove to be more persistent than we have assumed. Also, inflation expectations
relevant for wage and price setting could be lower currently than in the baseline or may
not edge up in the coming years as the staff assumes. To the upside, with the economy
projected to be moving further above its longer-run potential, inflation may increase more
than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize
nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation.
1 If the ELB risk were computed around a lower path for the federal funds rate, then the
probability naturally would be higher. For example, the probability is 22 percent if calculated using the
median federal funds rates from the FOMC’s September Survey of Economic Projections.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
y
t
n
ai To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
t
r
e baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first scenario, we study a
c
n
U downside risk for inflation in which households and businesses have lower inflation
&
s expectations than in the baseline because they perceive that monetary policy will be too
k
s
Ri tight to return inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. In
contrast, the second scenario examines the upside risk that the response of wages and
prices to the further tightening of labor market conditions will be stronger than we have
assumed and that inflation expectations will be more responsive to a rise in actual
inflation. In the third scenario, we present the implications of a substantial correction in
asset valuations. The fourth scenario illustrates the effects of a lower natural rate of
unemployment that is initially misperceived by the central bank. The fifth scenario
envisions that a pickup in global inflation driven by higher oil prices prompts faster
monetary policy normalization in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), thereby
tightening financial conditions in the global economy. The last scenario considers the
possibility that a slowdown in China’s economy triggers financial turbulence in emerging
market economies (EMEs), with significant spillovers to the global economy.
We simulate these scenarios using four staff models.2 In all of the scenarios, the
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline. In addition, the
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in
all of the scenarios.
Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model]
Headline PCE price inflation has been below the Committee’s 2 percent objective
for most of the past five years. It has averaged about 1¼ percent during this period and
has remained subdued more recently even though resource utilization now exceeds our
estimate of its sustainable level. In the baseline projection, inflation is assumed to drift
up to the 2 percent target by 2020, in part reflecting further tightening in resource
utilization and a gradual rise in inflation expectations. However, especially in light of the
persistently low inflation of the past several years, there is a risk that the public will
perceive the stance of monetary policy as being too tight now and in the future to achieve
2 The four models used are an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S.
economy based on Del Negro, Giannoni, and Schorfheide (2015); FRB/US, which is a large-scale
macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy; a calibrated DSGE model with search and matching
frictions in the labor market; and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

r
e
Lower inflation expectations cause actual inflation to be lower than in the baseline c
n
U
and to reach only 1¾ percent in 2022. Consequently, the federal funds rate increases less
&
than in the baseline, but real interest rates as perceived by the private sector are initially s
k
s
slightly higher. As a result, real GDP growth is a touch lower in 2018 than in the
Ri
baseline. The unemployment rate runs about ¼ percentage point above the baseline in
2018 and remains above the baseline through 2022.3
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]
Alternatively, the further tightening of resource utilization in the baseline could
cause inflation to rise much faster than projected. Some research suggests that the
relationship between labor utilization and wage growth may become stronger—the
Phillips curve may steepen—when the labor market is very tight.4 In FRB/US, faster
wage growth implies higher price inflation as well. This scenario captures the risk of that
nonlinearity by boosting the response of wages to tightening labor utilization and by
assuming that longer-run inflation expectations become more sensitive to the higher
realized price inflation that stems from faster wage growth.5
Inflation reaches 3 percent by mid-2021, compared with about 2 percent in the
baseline. In response to the higher path of inflation, the federal funds rate rises more and
peaks at 5 percent in 2022; real longer-term interest rates are also slightly higher. As a
3 The Phillips curve in this model is very flat, so it may seem surprising that inflation falls
noticeably despite only a modest increase in the unemployment rate. That outcome arises because price
setters in the model are very forward looking, and production costs fall little but persistently.
4 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth and slack, see, for example,
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet? Assessing Progress toward Full
Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vol. 9 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas, October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf; and Jeremy
Nalewaik (2016), “Non-Linear Phillips Curves with Inflation Regime-Switching,” Finance and Economics
Discussion Series 2016-078 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),
http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.078.
5 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the
current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of the increase reflects a comparison between
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

historical standards. Moreover, interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and high-
yield bonds currently are near their lowest levels since the financial crisis. While some of
the decline in bond spreads reflects improvements in the credit quality of these
borrowers, estimates of bond risk premiums suggest that bondholders are now more
willing to take on risk. Also, the Treasury term premium is currently unusually low.
In this scenario, we assume that both equity and bond risk premiums move fairly
quickly toward historically normal levels. By the end of next year, equity prices have
fallen about 20 percent; the term premium on Treasury securities has risen halfway to its
assumed long-run value; and the triple-B corporate bond spread has increased about
30 basis points above the baseline, enough to move it back close to its median historical
value. That correction in asset values is assumed to also cause an erosion in consumer
and business sentiment.
Real GDP growth slows to about 1¾ percent in 2018, roughly ¾ percentage point
less than in the baseline. The unemployment rate remains around 4 percent through
2022. With labor utilization less tight and inflation slightly lower, the federal funds rate
rises more gradually and is 3¾ percent at the end of 2022, about ¼ percentage point
below the baseline.
Unlike the decrease in house prices before the Great Recession, the asset price
declines in this scenario have relatively mild consequences. This outcome reflects in part
our assumption in this scenario that the losses resulting from these market corrections do
not induce significant disruptions to the broad functioning of the financial system.
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [Search and Matching
DSGE Model]
In the baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to 3.5 percent by the end of
2019, with the natural rate of unemployment assumed to hold steady at 4.7 percent
through the projection period. However, the natural rate could be driven lower by a
variety of influences, such as demographic factors or improvements in job-matching

Economic activity is somewhat stronger than in the baseline as firms create more
jobs and expand production in response to lower wages. As a result, the unemployment
rate falls to 3¼ percent by the end of 2019. However, because the unemployment rate
does not decline as much relative to the baseline as the true natural rate does, resource
utilization is less tight, and inflation remains persistently below the baseline through
2022. Despite the lower path for inflation in this scenario, the federal funds rate is only
slightly lower than in the baseline because of the misperception of the degree of tightness
in the labor market.
Higher Oil Prices and Faster Advanced Foreign Economy Tightening
[SIGMA]
Although we project that oil prices will decline gradually from recent highs,
political tensions in the Middle East could lead to oil supply disruptions that boost global
oil prices substantially and put upward pressure on headline inflation.7 Our expectation is
that most foreign central banks would look through an oil-driven rise in headline inflation
and, hence, not adjust their policy stance materially. However, this scenario considers
the plausible risk that a sharp and persistent rise in oil prices against the backdrop of
fairly tight AFE labor markets could prompt noticeably faster monetary policy
6 Central bank learning about the true natural rate of unemployment is assumed to solve a signal
extraction problem. Importantly, the amount of uncertainty is informed by the very wide confidence
interval around estimates of the natural rate of unemployment in Douglas O. Staiger, James H. Stock, and
Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Cristina
D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press), pp. 195–246. Thus, learning is slow and the central bank revises its estimate of the natural
rate by only about ¼ percentage point by the beginning of 2020.
7 The Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook box in this Tealbook “The Limited
Effectiveness of Shale Oil in Moderating Oil Price Fluctuations” argues that while an oil-supply disruption
abroad would induce some expansion of oil production in the United States, this production response would
provide only limited offset to the upward pressure on oil prices.

in AFE corporate borrowing spreads and sovereign bond term premiums. Tighter
financial conditions in the AFEs spill over to the rest of the world, and the broad real
dollar depreciates 3 percent.
Lower foreign demand, higher oil prices, and tighter financial conditions weigh
on economic activity in the United States, notwithstanding the stimulus to net exports
from the depreciation of the dollar. U.S. GDP growth moderates to 2 percent in 2018,
about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline. Given higher oil prices and the boost
to import prices from the dollar’s depreciation, core PCE inflation runs above 2 percent
starting in the second half of 2018. Unlike foreign central banks, the Federal Reserve
reacts according to the baseline inertial Taylor rule; with core inflation higher but
resource utilization somewhat lower, the federal funds rate is little changed relative to the
baseline.
China-Driven Emerging Market Economy Turbulence [SIGMA]
In our baseline forecast, we expect Chinese real GDP growth to gradually
moderate from about 6½ percent in the second half of this year to a still-solid 5¾ percent
pace by the end of 2020. However, given China’s underlying vulnerabilities—including
high corporate debt and a large and opaque shadow banking system—adverse shocks
could trigger a quicker and more pronounced slowdown of Chinese GDP growth and
renewed pressures on the renminbi, with negative spillovers to other EMEs. In this
scenario, we assume that GDP growth in China and other EMEs falls to only 3 percent
and 1 percent, respectively, in 2018, as corporate borrowing spreads increase 150 basis
points and confidence declines. The stresses in EMEs also trigger a sizable rise in
borrowing spreads in the United States and in the AFEs, while flight-to-safety flows
cause the broad real dollar to appreciate 10 percent and depress term premiums on U.S.

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&&
ss
kk
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals ss
RRii
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
t
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. In the box “Substitutability of Policy Instruments,”
we summarize an approach for estimating the policy tightening associated with the
balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), a first-difference rule, and a nominal income
(NI) targeting rule. These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for
the output gap and core inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels. The top
and middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which
is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline. The prescriptions are a little higher than
the previous Tealbook, reflecting a small upward revision to inflation.
• The prescriptions of the first-difference rule are essentially the same in the
near term as the Tealbook baseline. The prescriptions are also essentially the
same in the near term as the prescriptions of the first-difference rule in the
October Tealbook, reflecting a virtually unchanged path for the output gap.
• Under the NI targeting rule, the federal funds rate responds to the current
output gap and the shortfall of the level of the GDP price deflator from the
path it would have attained had it increased at an annual rate of 2 percent
since 2011:Q4; the current shortfall in the GDP price deflator is about
4 percent. Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Except for the
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that
are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

Substitutability of Policy Instruments
In October 2017 the Committee initiated its balance sheet normalization program, which
gradually raises caps on redemptions of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In this
discussion, we use the FRB/US model and the staff’s balance sheet model to express the
monetary tightening associated with the normalization program in terms of an alternative
path of the federal funds rate that is consistent with nearly identical outcomes for inflation
and unemployment.1 Our main finding is that the balance sheet normalization program, in
combination with the path for the federal funds rate assumed in the staff forecast, is likely to
have about the same macroeconomic effects as a hypothetical alternative policy combination
of continuing full reinvestment while raising the federal funds rate about 50 basis points more,
over the next five years, than assumed in the staff forecast.
s
e
gi
To evaluate the substitutability of the two policy instruments, we compare the path of the
e
a t federal funds rate under two scenarios. In the Tealbook baseline, policymakers gradually
r
t reduce the size and duration of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio according
S
y to the normalization program announced by the Committee. In the alternative scenario, we
c
li assume that the Committee opted to continue reinvesting maturing securities until the date
o
P when demand for currency and reserves necessitates expanding the balance sheet from its
y
r current size. The path of the federal funds rate in the alternative scenario is constructed so as
a
e t to keep the paths of inflation and the unemployment rate nearly identical to their paths in the
n
o Tealbook baseline.2 By comparing the path for the federal funds rate in the alternative
M
scenario with the corresponding path in the Tealbook baseline, we obtain an approximation of
the tightening in monetary policy implied by balance sheet normalization expressed in terms
of a revision in the path of the funds rate relative to the Tealbook baseline path.3
The left panel of the figure shows the estimated 10-year Treasury term premium effects (TPEs)
for both scenarios.4 In the Tealbook baseline, the 10-year Treasury TPE is estimated to be
negative 90 basis points at the time of the initiation of the program in October. In the
alternative scenario, the larger size and longer duration of the balance sheet results in a
contemporaneous 10-year TPE of negative 125 points. The difference between the two term
1 We abstract from any costs or benefits of holding a larger balance sheet over the longer-term and
focus solely on the term premium effects (TPEs) of changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.
Unmodeled costs of a large balance sheet include the possibility that, in the event of a negative economic
shock, a purchase program may be less likely to be adopted and could have smaller marginal TPEs.
2 To construct this alternative scenario, we compute the optimal control path for the federal funds
rate under a loss function that places equal weight on the unemployment gap and on deviations of inflation
from 2 percent for both the baseline and alternative TPEs. We then add the difference in the federal funds
rate paths to the Tealbook baseline policy rate path. This procedure keeps macroeconomic outcomes
essentially unchanged.
3 The alternative simulation begins in 2017:Q4, so that the deviation in policy rates from the Tealbook
baseline quantifies the funds rate equivalent of the entire normalization program. The simulations embed the
assumptions that financial market participants as well as price and wage setters have perfect foresight.
4 The Tealbook baseline balance sheet, income, and TPE projections are reported in the Balance
Sheet Projections section of Tealbook B. The Tealbook baseline and alternative TPEs are constructed using an
implementation of the term structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) under the Tealbook baseline and
alternative assumptions for the evolution of the balance sheet that would occur under continued
reinvestment. See Canlin Li and Min Wei (2013), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the
Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchase Programs,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 9
(March), pp. 3–39.

premium paths widens to about 55 basis points as the alternative SOMA portfolio maintains its
current size for a number of years and includes a larger amount of longer-term Treasury
securities and agency mortgage-backed securities than in the baseline. Both TPE paths narrow
over time because of the aging of the SOMA portfolio and as balance sheets move closer to
their normalized sizes in proportion to nominal GDP.5
The right panel of the figure shows the baseline federal funds rate path and the alternative
path that, by construction, generates nearly identical macroeconomic outcomes. Because the
normalization in the size of the balance sheet under the Tealbook baseline gradually tightens
financial conditions, the alternative path of the policy rate rises steadily above the baseline
policy path so as to generate an equivalent gradual tightening in financial conditions. The
offsetting federal funds rate path is, on average, about 40 basis points above the baseline over
the horizon shown, compared with an average difference of 50 basis points for the 10-year
TPEs.
Our results depend on several assumptions, three of which are particularly noteworthy. First,
the staff’s models postulate that balance sheet policies operate through term premium
effects, estimates of which are subject to considerable uncertainty, and that those effects are
transmitted to the real economy entirely via aggregate demand channels.6 Second, the
effects of both balance sheet policy and federal funds rate policy—and therefore our policy-
equivalence estimates—crucially depend on the modeling of the public’s expectations. Third,
the monetary accommodation associated with a particular reinvestment strategy could differ
under a different composition of the SOMA portfolio or a different economic projection.7
5 Beyond the projection period, the TPEs converge to zero as the balance sheet ultimately expands in
line with growth in Federal Reserve notes and Federal Reserve Bank capital.
6 If balance sheet policy also had implications for the economy’s aggregate supply—for instance via
unmodeled effects on financial market fluctuations—then policymakers might face a tradeoff between
stabilizing prices and reaching full employment. Such considerations would, in turn, imply a different degree
of substitutability between balance sheet policy and policy for the federal funds rate.
7 These results are valid in the neighborhood of the Tealbook baseline, in which the federal funds
rate is projected to remain well away from the effective lower bound and mortgage rates are not projected to
fall precipitously. The difference between the two reinvestment strategies would become more pronounced
during an economic contraction because the rapid decline in the federal funds rate associated with such a
scenario would induce prepayments of mortgages. As a result, the difference between the required federal
funds rate paths across the alternative policies would increase.

The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept

• At 0.83 percent, the SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the

forecast despite the lower median path for the real federal funds rate in the

baseline—FRB/US r* is higher than the corresponding 12-quarter average

2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the September 2017 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a
smooth and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered
in the SEP. For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.
3 For comparability, the previous Tealbook value of FRB/US r* is adjusted to be consistent with a
minor revision in the model’s fiscal rules.

than the closing of the output gap in three years that are embedded in the
Tealbook-baseline reaction function and in FOMC participants’ views on the
course of appropriate policy.
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and
the NI targeting rule. These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output
gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified
policy rules.4 The simulations are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers
commit to following the prescriptions of each rule in the future and that financial market
participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow
through on this commitment, but also understand the interest rate and macroeconomic
implications of policymakers doing so.5 The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are
nearly the same in the medium term as those obtained conditional on the October
Tealbook projection.
• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, the federal funds rate increases, on
average, a little less than 1 percentage point per year through 2020. The
federal funds rate peaks a little below 4¼ percent in 2021 before slowly
moving down toward its longer-run level, which the staff assumes will be
2½ percent.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate to values that exceed the corresponding Tealbook baseline
values by an average of about 1 percentage point over the next three years.
This relatively sharp initial increase in the federal funds rate is followed by a
slightly lower path for the federal funds rate beyond 2021 compared with the
Tealbook baseline. In the next few years, the unemployment rate is no more
4 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in
the top panel of the first exhibit.
5 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly
understands the implications of the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC. In contrast to
this modeling assumption, the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a
period during which the public learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications. We abstract
here from considerations of this kind.

2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the

than ¼ percentage point higher under the Taylor (1999) rule than under the
Tealbook baseline and runs below the baseline starting in mid-2022. Inflation
under the Taylor (1999) rule runs a bit above its baseline path over the horizon
shown. The reason the sharp increase in the federal funds rate under the
Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy is
that agents in the model are forward looking and correctly anticipate that the
federal funds rate beyond the medium term will be lower than under the
Tealbook baseline; the result is a path for the 10-year real Treasury yield that
runs below that in the baseline over the majority of the next decade.
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate. However, it prescribes lower federal funds rates than does
the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown, because the Taylor (1993) rule
responds less strongly to the projected excess in output over its assumed
potential level. As with the Taylor (1999) rule, the initial sharp increase in the
federal funds rate under the Taylor (1993) rule is not associated with an
appreciably weaker economy because agents in the model are forward looking
and anticipate the lower federal funds rate path beyond the medium term.
Indeed, beginning in 2020, the Taylor (1993) rule prescribes a path of the
federal funds rate that runs below the Tealbook baseline for some time. As a
result, there is a large and persistent decrease in the 10-year real Treasury
yield relative to the baseline. Accordingly, inflation under the Taylor (1993)
rule exceeds inflation under the Tealbook baseline by more than under the
Taylor (1999) rule. The unemployment rate is closer to the Tealbook baseline
path in the near term and is lower than the path implied by both the baseline
and the Taylor (1999) rule over the remainder of the period shown.
• The path for the federal funds rates prescribed by the first-difference rule is
similar to the path in the Tealbook baseline over the next two years but runs
below the baseline path for some years thereafter. The latter divergence
occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the projected
narrowing of the output gap beyond the next three years. The associated
lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction with expectations of higher
inflation in the future, implies lower longer-term real interest rates than in the
Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of resource utilization and

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

inflation. Thus, the first-difference rule generates outcomes for the
unemployment rate that are lower than, and inflation outcomes that exceed,
the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection.
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the
federal funds rate than the other rules because this rule seeks to compensate
for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as measured by the rate of increase in
the implicit price deflator for GDP) from an annual rate of 2 percent since the
end of 2011. Because we assume that policymakers can credibly commit to
closing this gap and that economic agents correctly anticipate the long period
of low federal funds rates, the path of the real 10-year Treasury rate is lower
than under the other policy rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years.
Accordingly, the path for the unemployment rate is substantially lower than in
all other simulations shown except the first-difference rule, dropping to just
above 3 percent in 2020.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.6
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.7 The federal funds rate paths
prescribed by optimal control over the simulation period are similar to those obtained
when conditioned on the October Tealbook projection.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
6 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
7 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers achieve improved
economic outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be
optimal from the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).
Furthermore, it is assumed that these promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by
financial market participants. However, under the alternative assumption of optimal policy under
discretion, which does not rely on the credibility of policymakers’ promises, the results are similar for all
specifications of the loss function except for that with an asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path.8 This higher path arises
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years—an outcome
that policymakers with the equal weights cost function judge to be costly. The
tighter policy results in a path for the unemployment rate that is substantially
closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate and a path for headline PCE
inflation that is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over
the period shown, consistent with the limited response of inflation to the level
of resource utilization in the FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate but that is identical
to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above
the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is
considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal
weights and below the Tealbook baseline path until the later part of the
coming decade. With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this
initially more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to
raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the
natural rate of unemployment. Because the public believes that policymakers
will follow through on this policy rate path even as the unemployment rate
substantially undershoots its natural rate, the tighter labor market brings
inflation to 2 percent more quickly than in the case of equal weights. Starting
in the middle of the next decade (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a
little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the
8 When we use the SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal funds rate
under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at just below 4 percent in 2020:Q3
compared with 6½ percent at the beginning of 2021 under the Tealbook baseline.

inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated
resource utilization.9
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical to that specification. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly
more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming
years. The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an

but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate soars to near 9½ percent in
2018 and then settles near 6 percent over much of the remainder of the period
shown. This sharp tightening of policy reflects an effort to prevent the
undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment projected by the staff. The
paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 10-year Treasury yield are
also notably higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights.
Because the short-run Phillips curve is quite flat in the FRB/US model and
agents in the model take the 2 percent inflation objective to be credible, this
policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to that in the equal-weights case
over the period shown, even though, in the period through 2020, this policy
9 The simultaneous overshoot of the longer-run inflation objective and the undershoot of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “Asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time inconsistent in the sense that, if given the opportunity to re-optimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular
model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined
as the difference between nominal income, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of the
level of nominal GDP, and a target value, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡

target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of
s potential GDP. These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the

minal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology

then converted to a 360-day basis.

do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see Orphanides
(2003).
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
