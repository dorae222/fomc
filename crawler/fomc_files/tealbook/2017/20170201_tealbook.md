Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Our assessment of the broad macroeconomic situation has not changed materially D
n
since the time of our previous projection, and incoming data suggest that the economy is o
c
E
continuing to expand at a moderate rate. Over the second half of 2016, real GDP now c
ti
s
appears to have increased about 2¾ percent at an annual rate, a little faster than in our e
m
December forecast. However, the additional strength reflects factors that we think will o
D
prove transitory and reverse early this year. Consequently, the level of GDP in the
second quarter of this year is roughly unrevised from our earlier projection. Moreover,
the labor market continued to improve gradually through year-end, much as we had
anticipated. Overall, we view the economy as currently operating a little above its
sustainable level, with real GDP about ½ percent above potential output and the
unemployment rate—at 4.7 percent—¼ percentage point below its natural rate.
Over the medium term, we continue to project that real GDP will increase about
2 percent per year in 2017 and 2018—about the same as its pace in 2016—before
slowing slightly to 1¾ percent in 2019 as monetary policy continues to tighten. With
GDP increasing faster than potential, the output gap widens to 1¾ percent at the end of
2019, which is a tick wider than in the December projection. Correspondingly, the
unemployment rate is projected to fall to 4.1 percent in 2019—just a touch lower than in
the December projection and nearly 1 percentage point below our estimate of its natural
rate.
Our inflation projection is also little revised relative to December. We continue to
project that total PCE price inflation will move up gradually to 1.9 percent in 2019; core
PCE inflation also drifts higher and now rounds up to 2.0 percent in 2019. Relative to
2016, a variety of small factors push up core inflation over the medium term, including
the fading effects of earlier declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices and
tightening resource utilization.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
v The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 is a touch below the
e
D
projections from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip
n
o consensus forecast. The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is a bit below Blue
c
E Chip in 2018 and the rather outdated SPF survey in 2017. The staff’s inflation
c
ti projection is roughly in line with the outside forecasters for the CPI but below the SPF
s
e
m forecasts for PCE price inflation in 2017 and 2018.

50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

coming months and years. As a result, we have retained our placeholder t l
u
O
assumption that the new Administration will implement adjustments to fiscal
&
policy that increase the annual “primary” budget deficit (that is, the deficit e l
v
e
excluding interest costs) by 1 percent of GDP; for now, we also continue to D
n
assume that this fiscal expansion takes the form of a cut in personal income o
c
E
taxes that begins in the third quarter of 2017. This fiscal expansion is c
ti
s
projected to boost the growth rate of real GDP about ¼ percentage point per e
m
year in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (exclusive of multiplier effects and any offsets o
D
from higher interest rates and the dollar).1
 We continue to project that all discretionary policy actions across federal,
state, and local governments will increase real GDP growth ½ percentage
point in 2017 and roughly ¼ percentage point in both 2018 and 2019.
Monetary Policy
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which we use to
mechanically set the federal funds rate in our projection, calls for the federal
funds rate to increase about 1 percentage point per year, on average, over the
projection period and to average 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.2
The path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged from our
December projection.
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current
level through the third quarter of 2017 and then begin to contract, as the
proceeds from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly over the medium
term, from an average of 2.5 percent in the current quarter to 3.9 percent by
1 We estimate that delaying the introduction of the fiscal policy change until the beginning of 2018
would lower the level of real GDP at the end of 2019 by about 0.1 percent (inclusive of multiplier effects
and offsets from higher interest rates and the dollar) and raise the unemployment rate by roughly half a
tenth. In the Risks and Uncertainty section, we present scenarios exploring some alternative possibilities
regarding the size and composition of the fiscal expansion.
2 We have maintained the upward adjustment introduced in the December Tealbook that boosted
the intercept in the longer run by ¼ percentage point to take account of the greater fiscal stimulus.

ttii Equity Prices and Home Prices
ss

mm
 Equity prices have risen about 2¾ percent since the December Tealbook. The
oo
DD
increase was a little larger than we had anticipated, and we view it as reducing
the scope for further stock price appreciation over the medium term. As a
result, we now project that equity prices will rise about 1 percent per year on
average over the projection period, compared with the 1¼ percent rate of
appreciation in the December Tealbook.
 According to the latest data, house prices have been rising faster in recent
months than we had expected and faster than the average growth rate over the
previous year. We think that the brisk pace of house price growth partly
reflects a stronger effect of housing supply constraints than we previously
anticipated. Because we expect these constraints to abate only gradually, we
have raised our projection for house price growth through 2019. We now
project that home values will rise at an annual average rate of 4½ percent over
the medium term. By the end of 2019, the projected level of house prices is
2½ percent higher than in the December Tealbook.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign real GDP rose at an estimated annual rate of 2¼ percent in the fourth
quarter—up slightly from its average growth rate over the prior couple of
quarters. Consistent with continued solid readings on activity, we expect
foreign growth of 2½ percent in the current quarter. Growth should remain at
about that pace through the rest of the forecast period, supported by
accommodative policies in the advanced foreign economies and a moderate
recovery in Latin America. This forecast is little changed relative to the
December Tealbook.
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated about ½ percent since the time of
the December Tealbook, primarily reflecting a further sizable appreciation
relative to the Mexican peso. We expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at
Page 6 of 112

o
o
roughly a 1¼ percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market t l

expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast.
&
Relative to the December Tealbook, our dollar projection is little changed. e l
v

Oil and Commodity Prices n
o
c
E
 Oil markets have been relatively quiet since the agreements late last year
c
ti
between OPEC and some non-OPEC countries to cut production. The spot s
e
m
price of Brent crude oil is now trading at $55 per barrel, and the December o
D
2019 futures price is currently just over $56.50 per barrel—both little changed
since the December Tealbook. Following these futures quotes, we continue to
project that oil prices will remain roughly flat over the medium term.
 Prices for industrial metals, after increasing sharply in late 2016, have edged
higher since the time of the December Tealbook on concerns about labor-
related supply disruptions and some greater Chinese demand. Food and
agricultural prices also edged up a bit because of concerns about both the
supply of sugar from Brazil and dry conditions in the Great Plains, which may
affect the supply of wheat.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the second half
of 2016 after rising only 1 percent in the first half. The step-up in growth from the first to
the second half of last year, which is a little larger than we projected in December,
reflected the stabilization of inventory investment as well as bigger gains in government
spending and private domestic final purchases. The upward revision to output growth in
the second half of last year is roughly mirrored by weaker growth in the first half of this
year, leaving the average pace essentially unchanged. We now project real GDP to grow
at a little less than a 2 percent rate in the first half of this year.
 By our estimate, consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in
the fourth quarter. We expect growth in the first half of this year to be only
slightly less brisk, supported by continued gains in employment and
household income, earlier increases in household wealth, and upbeat

consumer sentiment.3 We were somewhat surprised by the strength of t l
u
O
consumption growth in the fourth quarter (which we have revised up almost
&
¾ percentage point since the December Tealbook). But the surprise reflected e l
v
e
stronger-than-expected increases in the consumption of energy services and D
n
purchases of motor vehicles, which we expect to largely unwind this quarter. o
c
E
This downward revision to growth of consumer spending accounts for much c

of the small downward revision to near-term GDP growth. e

D
 Incoming indicators suggest that investment in equipment and intangibles
(E&I) rose moderately in the fourth quarter following net declines earlier in
the year. Given recent increases in orders of nondefense capital goods and a
widespread improvement in business sentiment, we project E&I investment
will grow at about a 4 percent pace in the first half of this year.4 We also
project nonresidential structures investment will grow at a 4½ percent pace
over the first half of this year as investment in drilling and mining structures
starts to rebound somewhat following two years of steep declines.
 After falling back in the middle of 2016, residential investment now appears
to be increasing at a moderate pace. In the fourth quarter, starts and permits
for single-family housing remained above their average pace in the first half
of 2016; sales of new and existing homes also remained solid through
November.5 However, with mortgage rates having risen notably since early
3 While we view the level of consumer sentiment as supportive of consumption growth, we have
taken little signal from the sharp improvement in sentiment in December. The December jump, which was
sustained in the preliminary January Michigan survey release, appears to be related to the election. A
recent research paper examines presidential elections since 2000 and finds that such election-related
movements in sentiment have had little effect on consumer spending (see Atif Mian, Amir Sufi, and Nasim
Khoshkhou (2015), “Government Economic Policy, Sentiments, and Consumption,” NBER Working Paper
Series 21316 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, July),
www.nber.org/papers/w21316?sy=316). However, in the Risks and Uncertainty section we explore the
implications of a more pronounced upshift in aggregate demand.
4 In addition to solid improvements in the activity indexes from the ISM and the Philadelphia Fed,
from which we usually take signal for investment spending, we have also seen outsized gains in business
sentiment in other surveys, such as the one from the National Federation of Independent Business and the
Conference Board’s CEO confidence survey. We will continue to monitor these surveys to see whether the
recent gains persist.
5 We received data on housing starts for December too late for inclusion in the staff baseline
forecast.

ratios near comfortable levels in most sectors outside of energy (inventories of

energy products remain very high), and thus we expect inventory investment
oo
DD
to have little effect on GDP growth in the first half of this year.
 After adding nearly 1 percentage point to U.S. GDP growth in the third
quarter, net exports are currently estimated to have subtracted about
1 percentage point in the fourth quarter—a bit more than expected in the
December Tealbook, as recent export data have been weak. Net exports are
projected to subtract just over ½ percentage point from real GDP growth in
the first half of 2017 as imports continue to respond to firming U.S. demand
and as a strong dollar boosts imports and restrains exports.
 The level of manufacturing production has changed little, on net, in recent
months (indeed, since late 2014), restrained by weak export demand and slow
domestic capital investment. To reflect the recent strengthening in the new
orders indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys, we have
marked up slightly manufacturing production in the first half of this year, but
growth is projected to be modest, given ongoing headwinds from weak
foreign demand.
Over the medium term, real GDP is projected to increase 2 percent in 2017 and
2018 before easing to 1¾ percent in 2019, as monetary policy continues to tighten.
 As in the past couple of Tealbooks, we expect potential output growth to creep
up gradually from 1½ percent this year to 1¾ percent at the end of the
medium term, owing to a small acceleration in structural labor productivity.
6 Consistent with our models and the experience of the “taper tantrum” in 2013, we expect higher
rates to reduce sales and construction with a lag of a few months. Such a delay may partly reflect a
temporary offsetting boost to demand from prospective homebuyers who jump into the market before rates
increase further. Indeed, in the Michigan survey there has been an increase in the number of respondents
reporting that it is a good time to buy a home in advance of rate increases.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET E
c
ti
s
e
The incoming data suggest that the labor market continued to tighten gradually m
o
through the end of last year. D
 Total nonfarm payroll employment is reported to have increased an average of
165,000 per month from October through December, about as expected and
well above the range of 80,000 to 110,000 per month that we judge is
consistent with an unchanged unemployment rate and labor force participation
declining in parallel with its trend path.
 After dropping to 4.6 percent in November, the unemployment rate ticked up
to 4.7 percent in December. For the quarter as a whole, the unemployment
rate averaged 4.7 percent—down 0.3 percentage point from the same period a
year earlier. Looking ahead, we expect the unemployment rate to remain at
this level through the middle of this year, unrevised from the December
Tealbook.
 The labor force participation rate (LFPR) edged back up to 62.7 percent in
December, the same level as its average in the fourth quarter. Over the past
year the LFPR has moved up a bit, which, when judged relative to its
declining trend, represents a tightening in the labor market. We expect the
participation rate to remain at 62.7 percent through the first half of 2017.
 Combining the unemployment rate and the LFPR, we see the employment-to-
population ratio as currently a little above its structural trend.
 Other indicators of labor market conditions have also continued to improve.
The share of employed individuals working part time for economic reasons
declined over 2016, as did the share of the long-term unemployed in overall
unemployment. In December, both were at their lowest levels since the
recession, albeit still somewhat above their averages prior to the recession.

 Labor productivity in the business sector is now estimated to have increased at
ee
mm
an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the second half of 2016 after having
oo
DD
declined at a ½ percent pace in the first half of the year. The resulting
1 percent increase for 2016 as a whole exceeds the average pace seen over the
preceding five-year period by about ½ percentage point.
The medium-term outlook for the labor market is for continued improvement
through 2019 but at a gradually slowing pace—a projection that is essentially unrevised
from the December Tealbook.
 As real GDP growth slows toward its potential rate, average monthly payroll
gains are expected to slow from about 180,000 in 2016 and 2017 to about
160,000 in 2018 and 120,000 in 2019.
 We project that labor productivity will increase at an average annual rate of a
bit less than 1 percent over the projection period, similar to its estimated pace
in 2016 and close to our estimate of its structural rate.
 After falling 1 percentage point cumulatively over the past two years, the
unemployment rate is projected to continue to decline, but at a slowing pace—
the unemployment rate falls a total of only ½ percentage point over the next
three years. Similarly, over the next three years both the labor force
participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio continue to improve
relative to their declining trends, but at a slowing pace.
 By the end of 2019, the unemployment rate is projected to reach 4.1 percent,
nearly 1 percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate. The level at
the end of 2019 is just a few basis points lower than our projection in the
December Tealbook. Both the labor force participation rate and the
employment-to-population ratio also end the medium-term projection
somewhat above our estimates of their trends.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION t l
u
O
&
On a 12-month-change basis, total PCE price inflation has continued to rise
l
e
v
toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective in recent months, mainly reflecting movements e
D
in energy prices, while core PCE price inflation has stayed around 1.7 percent. n
o
c
E
c
 Movements in the price of oil have pushed up the 12-month change in total ti
s
e
PCE prices from 0.2 percent in the middle of 2015 to an estimated 1.6 percent m
o
at the end of 2016 (based on PPI and CPI data through December). We expect D
this 12-month measure to move up to 2 percent in February and March,
mainly reflecting the effect of earlier declines in gasoline prices dropping out
of the calculation; it then eases to 1.8 percent in the second quarter.
 Based on the most recent data, we estimate that core PCE prices rose
1.7 percent in the 12 months through December, a touch below our projection
in the December Tealbook. We expect core inflation to remain close to this
level over the near term.7
 Core import prices are now estimated to have declined just slightly for 2016
as a whole, and in the first quarter of 2017 the ongoing drag from the dollar is
expected to push core import prices down at a ¼ percent pace. Thereafter, we
expect import price inflation to turn positive and move up to a ¾ percent rate
by 2018, consistent with moderate foreign inflation, a gradually appreciating
dollar, and slowly declining commodity prices. This path for core import
prices is estimated to have held down core PCE price inflation by
0.2 percentage point in 2016 and is expected to reduce core inflation by
0.1 percentage point per year over the remainder of the medium term.
 With regard to longer-term inflation expectations, the incoming data have
been mixed. Median expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers dropped to a historic low of
2.3 percent in December before rebounding to 2.5 percent in the January
preliminary report. The TIPS-based measure of 5-to-10-year-forward
inflation compensation, at about 2 percent, is little changed since the
7 Continuing the general pattern in previous years, monthly core PCE inflation in the first half of
2016 exceeded its pace in the second half of the year, and we have built some residual seasonality into the
projection.

core import and energy prices each contribute a small amount to the ¼ percentage point
acceleration in core inflation between 2016 and 2019. Further, as in previous Tealbooks,
we assume a small pickup (5 basis points in each of 2018 and 2019) in the prevailing
level of inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting. In this Tealbook, we
nudged up the core PCE inflation projection a few basis points in 2018 and 2019 to better
balance the inflation risks in light of the low unemployment rate, persistently rising house
prices, and continued strong rent increases. This adjustment caused the core inflation
projection—when rounded to one decimal place—to edge up 0.1 percentage point in
2018 and 2019.
The data on labor compensation received since the previous Tealbook have been
mixed; taken together, however, they strike us as broadly consistent with a labor market
that is operating close to its sustainable level against a backdrop of sluggish trend growth
in productivity.
 Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 0.4 percent in December
following a decline in November. We expect another relatively strong reading
in January, partly driven by increases in minimum wages in a number of
states.8 Over the past 12 months, this measure of wages has increased
2.9 percent after rising at a relatively steady pace of 2 percent earlier in the
recovery period.
 Compensation per hour in the business sector (as measured in the Productivity
and Costs release) is now estimated to have risen 2.9 percent over the four
8 The average state minimum wage is estimated to have risen from roughly $8.25 to $8.50 per
hour in January. Because a small percentage of workers will be affected by this change, the increase is
expected to add about 0.1 percentage point to the change in average hourly earnings in January.

DD We continue to project that hourly labor compensation growth in the business
sector (as reflected in the productivity and cost measure) will pick up gradually and reach
3½ percent by 2019 as the labor market tightens further.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 In the longer run, we continue to assume a natural rate of unemployment of
5 percent and a growth rate of potential GDP of 1.7 percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by the beginning of 2021.
 With output above its potential and inflation at the Committee’s 2 percent
objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about 1 percentage point above its
long-run value of 3 percent in 2021 and then moves back toward its long-run
value thereafter.
 Real GDP slows to 1.5 percent in 2020 and 1.3 percent in 2021 as the federal
funds rate is above its neutral level. The unemployment rate is 4.2 percent in
2020 and rises gradually toward its assumed natural rate in subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up from 1.9 percent in 2019 and slightly
overshoots the Committee’s long-run objective in 2020 and 2021 before
gradually converging to 2 percent.
9 The data are 3-month moving averages of the median 12-month change in hourly wages of
individuals, based on self-reported usual earnings in the Current Population Survey (CPS). The index
covers only individuals who earn less than $150,000 per year and who were employed in both the current
month of the CPS and one year earlier.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
After rebounding strongly in the third quarter from the second-quarter pothole,
total foreign growth moderated to an estimated 2¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter.
In line with the recent upbeat indicators on economic activity, we project that foreign
growth will edge up to 2½ percent—its estimated potential rate—over the next couple of
quarters and hold at about that pace through 2019, supported by accommodative
monetary policies in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and a moderate recovery in
Latin America. This forecast is little changed relative to the December Tealbook.
k
o
o
Over the past year, markets were recurrently roiled by concerns emanating from l
t
u
O
abroad, but the global economy appears to have weathered the shocks in 2016 fairly well
&
and seems to be better positioned going forward. Some of the global risks that e l
v
e
preoccupied markets and policymakers have subsided to some extent, including those D
n
associated with further declines in commodity prices, the fallout from Brexit, and the o
c
E
financial stresses in the European banking system. However, other concerns remain.
l
’
t
n
One such concern is possible turmoil in the emerging market economies (EMEs) in the I
face of rising U.S. interest rates, further dollar appreciation, and uncertainty regarding
trade policies. (See the “Stronger Dollar and EME Turbulence” alternative scenario in
the Risks and Uncertainty section.) Additionally, the possibility of a hard landing in
China remains an important risk, as the credit-easing undertaken by authorities to bolster
economic growth has heightened the vulnerabilities of the corporate and financial sectors
to future shocks.
Overall, the abatement of some downside risks, along with signs of strengthening
industrial production and trade abroad, have led us to contemplate upside risk to our
foreign outlook. Accommodative monetary policy abroad, progress on balance sheet
repair, and reduced fiscal pressures could spur faster foreign growth than we are currently
projecting, as discussed in our “Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar” alternative
scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Inflation in the AFEs has increased in recent months but remains significantly
below central banks’ targets. Overall, we estimate that AFE inflation picked up in the
fourth quarter to an annual rate of almost 1½ percent, up from ¾ percent in the third
quarter, largely reflecting an increase in retail energy prices caused by a lagged pass-
through of higher oil prices. Going forward, and in line with still-subdued core inflation

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) January 19, 2017
readings, we expect inflation in most of the AFEs to increase only gradually, and in the
euro area and Japan to remain well below 2 percent even in 2019. Given the restrained
outlook for inflation, we continue to expect monetary policy in the AFEs to remain
accommodative through 2019. In line with this view, the European Central Bank (ECB)
at its December meeting, which occurred just after the close of last month’s Tealbook,
announced the extension of its asset purchase program until at least December 2017.
Inflation also rose in most EMEs in the fourth quarter, bringing aggregate EME
inflation to an estimated 3 percent, up from 2¼ percent in the third quarter. An increase
in retail energy prices helped raise inflation from very low levels in emerging Asia, while
k
o the sharp depreciation of the peso continued to put upward pressure on inflation in
o
l
u t Mexico. In contrast, in South America, growing resource slack as well as some
O
& stabilization of currencies in the region helped push inflation down faster than predicted.
l
e Going forward, EME inflation is expected to average about 3 percent over the forecast
v
e
D
period, with declines in Latin America roughly offsetting moderate increases in Asia.

• Euro Area. Recent indicators—such as November industrial production and PMIs as
well as confidence readings through December—suggest that GDP growth moved up
to nearly 2 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.4 percent in the third. Thereafter, we
project that GDP growth will slow to a still-above-potential pace of 1¾ percent in the
first quarter before edging up to almost 2 percent by 2019, supported by
accommodative monetary policy. This forecast is a touch stronger than in the
December Tealbook as a result of a weaker euro and higher equity prices. This
projection takes into account that, with anti-EU sentiment prevalent across the euro
area and with national elections in France, Germany, and possibly Italy in 2017,
elevated political uncertainty is likely to trigger bouts of volatility and financial
stress.
On December 8, the ECB announced the extension of its asset purchase program—
originally scheduled to last at least through March 2017—until at least
December 2017; starting in April, however, it will lower its monthly pace of
purchases from €80 billion to €60 billion. Relative to our expectations at the time of
the December Tealbook, the ECB extended the program for a longer period albeit at a
slower pace of purchases. With core inflation below 1 percent at the end of 2016 and
headline inflation projected to linger near 1½ percent through 2019, we anticipate that
Page 32 of 112

--- Page 36 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) January 19, 2017
the ECB will start tapering its purchases at the beginning of 2018 and cease them
entirely by the middle of that year. We also assume that the ECB will continue to
reinvest the proceeds of its program during the forecast period while keeping policy
rates at their current levels until late 2019. These assumptions are in line with the
official statement and press conference that followed the ECB’s January 19 meeting.
• United Kingdom. Strong PMIs and confidence indicators through December suggest
that economic activity was stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, with real
GDP growing slightly below the 2.3 percent pace recorded in the third quarter. We
project growth to slow to 1½ percent in 2017 and remain subdued through the rest of
k
the forecast period as still-elevated uncertainty related to Brexit weighs on household o
o
l
and business spending. Formal Brexit talks are expected to start this March, and we u t
O
assume the U.K. authorities will not reach a deal with the EU until the end of the &
l
allotted two-year period in March 2019. We expect less economic integration post- e
v
e
Brexit and, thus, a weaker pace of U.K. potential growth. The projected outlook is a D
n
o
touch higher than in the December Tealbook because of further depreciation of c
E
sterling, which should support exports, and our sense that Brexit uncertainty has been ’ l
t
n
exerting less drag on growth than we had previously estimated. I
Inflation is expected to rise from 2 percent in the fourth quarter to 3½ percent in the
first quarter and to remain above the Bank of England’s (BOE) 2 percent target
through early 2018 as past exchange rate depreciation passes through to consumer
prices. We expect the BOE to complete its sovereign bond purchase program early
this year and to increase its policy rate 25 basis points in late 2017 but to continue
purchasing corporate bonds through the first quarter of 2018.
• Canada. After a strong rebound in activity in the third quarter, led by a recovery in
oil production, we estimate that Canadian GDP growth moderated to 2 percent in the
fourth quarter, little changed from our December forecast. Monthly GDP for October
contracted unexpectedly, but more-recent indicators—such as manufacturing
production and PMIs through December—were more buoyant. Going forward, we
project GDP growth to remain at around 2 percent in 2017, supported by
accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, before edging down in 2018. Relative
to the December Tealbook, this projection is a touch weaker in 2017, primarily
reflecting a stronger Canadian dollar.

• Japan. Following a major revision of the national accounts data, third-quarter real
GDP growth was revised down to 1.3 percent from 2.2 percent. However, growth in
the first half of 2016 was marked up almost 1 percentage point to 2.3 percent. Recent
data—including consumer confidence, PMIs, and industrial production—suggest that
GDP rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, about ¼ percentage point higher than
previously projected. We expect GDP growth to decline to just under 1 percent
through the end of 2018 before stalling in 2019 as a result of a planned consumption
tax hike. Japanese inflation was barely positive in the fourth quarter and is projected
to rise to only 1¼ percent by 2019. We anticipate the Bank of Japan will continue its
aggressive asset purchases and keep the 10-year yield near zero during the forecast
kk
oo
oo period but not introduce further easing measures.

ee • China. We have revised up our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter to
DD
nn
oo 6¾ percent, ½ percentage point above our December Tealbook estimate, and in line
cc
EE
with recent data for industrial production, manufacturing PMIs, and foreign trade.
ll
’’
tt
nn We expect some of this additional momentum in the industrial sector to carry over
II
into the first half of 2017. Nonetheless, we see growth edging down to 6¼ percent in
2017 and slowing further to 5¾ percent by 2019 as policy stimulus fades, with
authorities taking further steps to rein in credit growth. Although downside risks are
significant—including the possibility of a sharp adjustment in the property market, a
run on the financial system, and a destabilizing currency depreciation—in our
baseline we continue to expect authorities to be able to manage these risks.
Consumer price inflation in China increased to an estimated 2½ percent in the fourth
quarter from 1.3 percent in the third as previous declines in food prices faded. We
expect inflation to hover around 2½ percent over the forecast period. Meanwhile,
producer price inflation rose sharply in recent months after years of deflation, but the
increases in producer prices are concentrated in the mining and raw materials sectors,
which have generated little pass-through to consumer prices in the past.
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth is estimated to have declined from
3¾ percent in the third quarter to 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter, largely driven by a
sharp slowdown in India following outsized third-quarter growth. The slowdown in
India is due importantly to the negative effects of the demonetization effort. For the
other economies in the region, fourth-quarter growth was revised up, as incoming
Page 34 of 112

--- Page 38 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) January 19, 2017
indicators—such as PMIs, industrial production, and exports—point to an upturn in
their export-oriented manufacturing sectors, including the high-tech sector. We
expect growth in the region to pick up to 3¾ percent in the first half of 2017, a touch
higher than our December forecast, and to remain roughly at that pace through the
end of 2019.
Inflation in emerging Asia excluding China is estimated to have increased to
2¾ percent in the fourth quarter, up from 1 percent in the third quarter, on the back of
higher retail energy prices. We project inflation to pick up to 3½ percent by the end
of the forecast period, driven by higher commodity prices and currency depreciation.
k
o
o
• Mexico. Incoming data support our view that real GDP growth decreased to l
t
u
2 percent in the fourth quarter—down ½ percentage point from the December O
&
Tealbook—from 4 percent in the third. Manufacturing PMIs and exports have been l
e
v
disappointing recently, consistent with the ongoing weakness in U.S. manufacturing, e
D
n
while deteriorating consumer confidence suggests that household demand is
o
c
E
softening. We see GDP growth dropping further to 1½ percent this quarter as
l
’
t
heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade policy weighs on private investment and n
I
January’s 15 percent hike on fuel prices crimps household demand. Thereafter, we
expect growth to move gradually up to 2¾ percent by 2019, supported by the peso’s
30 percent real depreciation since mid-2014 and a boost from reforms to the energy
sector. The first-quarter projection is revised down ½ percentage point relative to the
December Tealbook.
We expect Mexican headline inflation to step up further to 6½ percent in the first
quarter from about 4 percent in the fourth, largely driven by sharp hikes in gasoline
prices. These hikes are part of the government’s deregulation plan, which would
allow gasoline and diesel prices to reflect market conditions by the end of this year.
With the peso depreciation and gasoline price increases putting upward pressure on
inflation, we expect the Bank of Mexico to tighten monetary policy further, on top of
the 275 basis point increase in the policy rate since late 2015 (including a 50 basis
point rate hike in December). We see inflation settling at 3¼ percent, a little above
the 3 percent midpoint of the target range, by 2018.
• Brazil. Recent data—including weak industrial production, falling manufacturing
PMI, low confidence readings, and rising unemployment—suggest that the Brazilian
economy remained mired in recession in the fourth quarter, but the pace of
Page 35 of 112

--- Page 39 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) January 19, 2017
contraction was slower than in the third quarter. In the current quarter we expect the
economy to bottom out, with GDP rising a tepid 1½ percent for 2017 as a whole and
2¼ percent in 2019. Growth will be supported by accommodative monetary policy
and fiscal reforms. Despite periodic bouts of political tension in the aftermath of the
Petrobras scandal and the impeachment of the previous president, the government has
succeeded in making progress on fiscal reform, including a cap on government
spending growth equal to the inflation rate.
A faster-than-expected decline in inflation in December to a 12-month rate of
6.3 percent, just below the upper bound of the central bank’s target range, has offered
k
o some respite. Against the backdrop of weak economic activity, a strengthening
o
l
t currency, and declining inflation, we expect more monetary easing than previously
u
O
anticipated. Indeed, the Brazilian Central Bank reduced its policy rate 75 basis points
&
l
e at its January meeting, a larger-than-expected cut.
v
e
D
o n • Turkey. Throughout 2016, financial pressures on Turkey had been growing in the
c
E
wake of a failed coup attempt, general geopolitical and security concerns, and rating
l
’
t
n downgrades by Moody’s and S&P. As a result, real GDP shrank at a double-digit
I
annual rate in the third quarter, the largest quarterly decline since the Global Financial
Crisis. Since the beginning of the year, market concerns about Turkey have
intensified, including an 8½ percent depreciation of the Turkish lira against the dollar.
The pressures on Turkish assets appear to be exacerbated by recent terrorist attacks
and concerns about the government’s response to inflation risks. These developments
are occurring amid an environment of significant external financing needs, slowing
economic growth, and escalation of political and geopolitical uncertainty. With
12-month inflation rising to 8.6 percent in December, significantly above the
7 percent upper bound of the central bank’s target range, the central bank is widely
expected to raise its policy rate at its next meeting on January 24. However, some
observers fear that political pressures could limit the central bank’s ability to take the
steps necessary to contain inflation.

Financial Market Developments
Financial asset prices were generally little changed, on balance, over the
intermeeting period. Nominal Treasury yields moved up notably across the curve in the
days following the December FOMC meeting, but yields mostly trended down during the
remainder of the period. Although market commentaries offered a variety of
explanations for the decline, it is difficult to identify a clear catalyst. Meanwhile, broad
domestic equity price indexes were about flat amid low volatility. Conversely, the dollar
exhibited considerable volatility and ended the period somewhat higher.
 Based on a straight read of market quotes, the probability of an increase in the
target range for the federal funds rate at or before the March meeting was little
changed at about 25 percent, while the cumulative probability of an increase
at or before the June meeting ticked up to about 70 percent.
 Yields on 2- and 5-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed, while
10-year yields decreased 9 basis points on net.
 TIPS-based inflation compensation was essentially unchanged, on balance, at
the 5-year horizon and increased 5 basis points at the 5-to-10-year horizon.
s
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes were little changed on net. Measures of e t
k
r
option-implied stock price volatility remained near the lower ends of their a
M
ranges over the past several years, as did corporate bond spreads. l

ci
n
a
 The broad dollar index was up somewhat, on balance, largely reflecting a n
Fi
sizable appreciation of the dollar against the Mexican peso.
 Year-end dynamics in money markets largely followed the pattern of recent
quarter-ends, although the upward pressure on repo rates at some past quarter-
ends was absent at this year-end.

communications were interpreted as less accommodative than expected. In particular,
market commentaries focused on the upward revision to the median projection for the
path of the federal funds rate this year in the Summary of Economic Projections.
Investors also took note of references in the December minutes to an elevated level of
uncertainty surrounding future fiscal policies and their potential effect on the economic
outlook. Meanwhile, market participants appeared to interpret economic data releases
over the period as a touch above expectations on balance.
Indicators of near-term expectations for the path of the federal funds rate
generally appear little changed over the intermeeting period. Based on a straight read of
quotes on federal funds futures, the risk-neutral probability of an increase in the target
range for the federal funds rate at or before the March meeting was little changed at about
25 percent, while the cumulative probability of an increase at or before the June meeting
edged up to about 70 percent. Both a straight read of the expected federal funds rate path
from OIS quotes and the estimated path from a staff model that adjusts for term
premiums were little changed, on net, suggesting no material change to expected policy
rates over the medium term.
Treasury yields moved up immediately following the December FOMC meeting
but generally decreased during the remainder of the intermeeting period, leaving 2- and
5-year yields little changed, on net, while the 10-year yield moved down 9 basis points.
While market commentary offered various explanations for the decline, a clear catalyst is s

levels. One-year-ahead option-implied volatilities on swap rates showed that the
uncertainty about the future level of long-term rates also remained elevated relative to
pre-election levels.
Corporate capital markets were relatively tranquil over the period. Broad U.S.
equity price indexes were little changed, on net, since the December FOMC meeting and
fluctuated in a relatively narrow range. However, equity prices remain notably higher
than pre-election levels, due in part to expectations for more expansionary fiscal policy in
the medium term (see the box “Expected Dividend Growth since the Election”).

Expected Dividend Growth since the Election
Since the U.S. presidential election, broad measures of equity prices have increased
significantly. In this discussion, we use prices of equity derivatives—specifically, dividend
futures contracts based on dividends paid by firms in the S&P 500 stock price index—to
interpret this move. They suggest that the recent increase in equity valuations appears
to have been largely driven by a change in market participants’ expectations regarding
the growth rate of dividends over the next two years and, to a lesser extent, by an
increase in the expected growth rate of dividends further out.
The holder of a long position in a dividend futures contract receives at maturity the
difference between the dividends paid out by the companies in the S&P 500 over the
year before expiration and the futures quote at the initiation of the long position.1
Figure 1 plots the time series of the market quotes for contracts expiring during the
period from 2017 through 2021. Market quotes fluctuated in a narrow range in the
second half of 2016 and then increased markedly after the U.S. election; quotes for
longer‐dated contracts rose the most.2
Given the nature of these futures contracts, we can extract information from their prices
about investors’ views of future equity dividends.3 In particular, using contracts with

1 Dividend futures contracts are expressed in S&P 500 index points. For example, on December 15,
2016, the 2017 dividend futures contract was trading at 48 while the S&P 500 index closed at 2,262,
which implies an expected dividend yield of 2.1 percent at the end of 2017.
2 Market quotes for contracts maturing in 2016 were also available during 2016, but as dividends are
announced much earlier than they are paid out to equity holders, they do not incur much uncertainty
and are excluded from this analysis.
3 The analysis assumes that dividend futures quotes do not reflect margin requirements, short‐sale
constraints, or any other form of limits to arbitrage.

different maturities, we can construct two measures of expected dividend growth: a
“near term” expected average dividend growth measure for the years 2017 and 2018 and
a “medium term” forward expected average dividend growth measure for the years
2019, 2020, and 2021.
As shown in figure 2, the near‐term measure of expected dividend growth rose gradually
but significantly between mid‐February and early November of last year. In contrast, the
medium‐term measure increased appreciably less, on balance, over the same period.
Since the U.S. election, implied near‐term dividend growth has jumped more than
3 percentage points, while medium‐term growth has stepped up more moderately.
The increase in the medium‐term measure could potentially reflect both a decline in the
premium required by investors to hold equity risk and a revision in their forecasts for
medium‐term dividend growth. The fact that the near‐term measure increased
substantially more than the medium‐term measure suggests that the run‐up in the S&P
500 since the election mostly reflects investors’ expectations of appreciably higher
dividend growth over the next two years, perhaps reflecting a potential decrease in
corporate taxes that would increase the level of after‐tax profits and therefore dividends
paid out. To put this revision in investors’ expectations into historical perspective, the
increase in the expected dividend growth rate would correspond to a movement in the
two‐year dividend growth rate for the S&P 500 from the 20th percentile to the
67th percentile of its historical distribution since 1985. Of course, a great deal of
uncertainty remains about the eventual effect of potential changes in fiscal policy on
corporate earnings and dividends.

as 10-year investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads, edged down over
the intermeeting period to near the lower ends of their ranges over the past several years.
Bank equity prices slightly underperformed the broader market late in the
intermeeting period, despite better-than-expected earnings releases from several large
banks, as investors apparently reassessed the large rise in bank equity prices seen after
the election. CDS spreads for the six largest BHCs declined a bit over the intermeeting
period. In December, banks as a group reported net unrealized losses on securities
holdings for the first time since 2014. Despite the large increase in yields for many
fixed-income assets since the election, banks’ net unrealized losses were rather small as a
share of their total holdings.
Foreign Developments
Although the dollar moved up immediately following the December FOMC
meeting, it subsequently depreciated against the backdrop of solid foreign economic data
and a reassessment of the post-election gains by investors, which seemed to be driven in
part by uncertainty about the incoming Administration’s fiscal and trade policies. On
balance, the broad dollar index rose somewhat, with notable movements against some
currencies. The dollar appreciated by 8¼ percent against the Mexican peso despite a rate
hike and intervention activity by the Bank of Mexico; it rose 8¾ percent against the
Turkish lira in the face of political and economic woes. Amid ongoing concerns about a
“hard” Brexit, the dollar appreciated against the British pound by about 3¼ percent on t s
e
k
net. Later in the period, the dollar rose sharply against the Canadian dollar and ended the r
a
M
period 1 percent higher. In contrast, the Chinese renminbi (RMB) appreciated against the
l
a
dollar by about ¾ percent. Some market commentary suggested that Chinese authorities
ci
n
a
were engineering “two way” volatility in the RMB exchange rate to stem speculative n
Fi
capital outflows, as RMB fixing rates were set at unexpectedly strong levels and liquidity
conditions in the offshore RMB market tightened noticeably during the first week of
January.
On balance, asset price movements in foreign financial markets were consistent
with a slight improvement in risk sentiment. Global equity prices were supported by
better-than-expected economic data and, in Europe, by the passage of major risk events.
Deutsche Bank reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on MBS-related
charges, and the Italian government approved a funding package and other measures to
support struggling domestic banks. Despite the improvement in the economic outlook in

because of spillovers from the lower U.S. Treasury yields. In the emerging markets,
sovereign spreads narrowed modestly, and flows to EME funds turned positive in recent

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Similar to developments in December 2015, money market rates responded
quickly to the change in the target range for the federal funds rate, and there were some
temporary pressures on money market rates evident at year-end. The effective federal
funds rate printed at 66 basis points every day, except for year-end, when the rate
dropped to 55 basis points. The overnight repo rate for Treasury collateral increased to
about 50 basis points in the days following the FOMC meeting and remained around that
level in the days leading up to year-end. In contrast to recent quarter-ends, Treasury repo
rates fell to just below the ON RRP rate at year-end. Market participants partially
attributed this decline to the larger amount of cash available in the repo market from
government MMFs, consistent with the large shift in assets from prime to government
MMFs associated with money market funds reform. In the days leading into year-end,
ON RRP take-up rose steadily, with ON RRPs outstanding reaching $468 billion at
year-end. Subsequently, take-up retraced to levels seen earlier in December.
Abroad, year-end dynamics in most foreign money markets were generally
s
t
orderly. However, very short-term FX swap bases at year-end widened notably, leading e
k
r
a
to modest increases in the take-up of dollar auctions at the Bank of Japan and the M
l
European Central Bank. Shortly thereafter, FX swap bases returned to levels closer to a
ci
n
recent norms. a
n
Fi
Conditions in other domestic short-term funding markets were generally stable
over the intermeeting period. Reflecting the federal funds rate hike and associated rise in
money market rates, net yields on money market fund investments moved up. Assets
under management for MMFs changed little in recent weeks, with government funds
experiencing modest net outflows and prime funds staying about flat. Flows into and out
of large time deposits at banks were modest after having experienced large outflows in
the lead-up to the deadline for implementation of money market funds reform.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households have remained
generally accommodative in recent months and continue to be supportive of economic
activity.
 Bank credit and nonbank credit remained largely available for small and large
businesses and for most households. However, mortgage standards continued
to be tight for households with low credit scores or harder-to-document
income, and credit card standards remained tight for subprime borrowers.
 The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
(SLOOS) indicates that standards reportedly tightened for consumer loans and
commercial real estate (CRE) loans but eased for commercial and industrial
(C&I) loans and residential real estate loans.1
 Overall credit flows remained solid in recent months. The available data
suggest that the net rise in interest rates since the summer has not had a
substantial effect on the flow of credit, although CRE and household lending
by banks slowed a bit in the fourth quarter.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms have stayed accommodative in recent
months, and credit remains widely available both from banks and from nonbank lenders.
Commercial and Industrial Lending
After a slowdown in the third quarter, C&I loan growth at banks picked up in the
fourth quarter, although it expanded at a pace that was lower than that of earlier in the
year. In the January SLOOS, a modest net share of domestic banks reported easing C&I
lending standards to large and medium-sized firms over the fourth quarter, while lending

Nonfinancial Corporate Debt and Equity Issuance
Nonfinancial corporations continued to find it relatively easy to raise funds in
bond and equity markets. While aggregate corporate leverage remained very elevated,
cash holdings are high, and debt service payments are low, due in part to interest rates
that are still low by historical standards.
After a slowdown in November, gross issuance of corporate bonds rebounded in
December to about its robust average pace over the past few years. Although early
estimates suggest that issuance has weakened somewhat in January, relatively low yields
indicate that bond financing conditions have remained accommodative overall.
Institutional leveraged loan issuance was very strong in December. Gross equity
issuance by nonfinancial firms was also solid in November and December, primarily
reflecting a robust pace of seasoned offerings.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Financing conditions in CRE markets remained largely accommodative, although
results from the SLOOS indicate that banks tightened their lending standards somewhat
over the course of 2016, especially for construction and land development loans, and are
expected to tighten them a bit further in 2017. CRE loans at banks continued to grow in
the fourth quarter, although at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.
The commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market has also remained
broadly supportive of CRE financing, and CMBS issuance was solid in the fourth quarter,
in part because issuers tried to complete deals before the implementation of new risk
retention rules in late December. The delinquency rate on CMBS moved up further in
November, but this increase in delinquencies did not affect financing conditions, as it
reflected delinquencies on loans originated before the financial crisis.

however, continued to be weak despite some signs of strengthening in November. More
recently, after the presidential election, indexes of small business optimism moved up
significantly.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit appeared generally available for state and local governments as well.
Although gross issuance of municipal bonds decreased somewhat in December, early
indications suggest that issuance is on pace to post a typical volume for January. In
addition, ratios of yields on 20-year general obligation bonds to those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities have changed little, on net, in recent months, suggesting that
financing conditions have not tightened for state and local governments.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit remained largely available to households with good credit scores, but
mortgage lending was still very tight for households with low credit scores or harder-to-
document income; credit card lending was still tight for households with low credit
scores. Bank lending to households was solid in the fourth quarter, although somewhat
slower than earlier in the year.
Household balance sheets remained supportive of credit provision. Total
household debt, the sum of residential mortgages and consumer credit, increased at a
moderate pace in the third quarter, leaving the ratio of household debt to disposable
personal income little changed at around its 2002 level.
Residential Mortgages
Financing conditions for residential mortgages remained accommodative for most
households. Our measure of the maximum debt-to-income ratio allowed for residential
mortgages suggests that mortgage credit was broadly available to households with high
and average credit scores.2 However, mortgage credit conditions continued to be very
tight for lower-score households, and improvements in recent years have been very slight.

loans 25 basis points, which would represent a small easing of credit for lower-score
households. The January SLOOS indicated that banks eased lending standards across
several categories of residential real estate loans in the fourth quarter.
In recent months, the interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages has moved in line
with that on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, rising notably after the election but
retracing part of its increase since mid-December. Although the mortgage rate is higher
than it was last summer, it is in the middle of the range seen over the past five years and
remains low by historical standards. Available indicators suggest that purchase
originations changed little in recent months despite higher mortgage rates, while
refinance originations fell sharply. Bank lending for residential mortgages was solid in
the fourth quarter, though its rate of growth was a touch lower than in the previous
quarter. Issuance of mortgage-backed securities was also robust.
Consumer Credit
Consumer credit continued to be broadly available to households, although credit
card lending standards remained tight for subprime borrowers. The average credit score
of auto loans originated in recent quarters has trended up gradually across various types
of lenders. A significant net fraction of January SLOOS respondents reported tightening
standards on auto lending.3 Moreover, a slightly smaller net fraction reported tightening
credit card standards. On net, banks also reported expecting standards to tighten further
on auto and credit card loans in 2017. Total consumer loan balances from both bank and
nonbank sources increased at a robust rate through November, with credit card loans,
student loans, and auto loans all increasing at a similar pace.
Delinquencies on credit card loans and on auto loans remained low through the
third quarter. Delinquencies on student loans continued to move down gradually from
elevated levels (see the box “Recent Dynamics of Student Loan Delinquencies” for a
broader discussion).
3 Banks account for only about 40 percent of outstanding auto loans and for a smaller share of auto
credit extended to nonprime borrowers.

Recent Dynamics of Student Loan Delinquencies
Unemployment rates for young individuals have been decreasing from an elevated level
for several years, suggesting that economic conditions for the young have been improving
(figure 1). As a result, borrowers currently repaying their student loans should be better
positioned to pay back those debts than cohorts of several years ago. However, staff
estimates derived from the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax (CCP) indicate that the
delinquency rate of total student debt outstanding has remained stubbornly high in recent
years (figure 2). These estimates raise the question of why we have not seen a decline in
student loan delinquencies given the considerable improvements in the labor market as
well as the debt repayment relief offered by the Department of Education’s (DOE) income-
driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans.1
New staff analysis points to the shifting composition of student debt in the CCP data as
having masked a decline in student loan delinquency rates since 2012. One distinctive
characteristic of student loans is that, unlike other types of consumer debt, the repayment
period is postponed until after a borrower has left school (rather than right after the loan
is originated).2 Thus, in the CCP data, student loans cannot be recorded as delinquent
while borrowers remain in school. Holding all other factors constant, a material rise in the
fraction of borrowers transitioning from school to the repayment period for their student
debt could, mechanically, boost the estimated overall delinquency rate. And, as discussed
later, a significant rise in the share of outstanding student debt requiring repayment does
appear to have occurred in recent years.
A limitation of the CCP is that it does not contain school enrollment information, so it is
impossible to know with certainty which student borrowers are already in the repayment
period of their student loan obligations. To measure the delinquency rate among this
category of borrowers, we construct an indicator of being in the repayment period based
on the recency of their student debt. More specifically, we treat all borrowers in the CCP
who opened their most recent student loan more than 365 days ago as being in the
repayment period.3 Figure 3 shows that this approximation results in a similar rate of
balances in the CCP categorized as being in the repayment period as in the DOE data for
federal loans.4 Moreover, figure 3 shows that the percentage of balances in the
repayment period has increased significantly in recent years, likely reflecting the outsized
1 IDR plans are student loan repayment plans that help borrowers manage their debt by tying their
monthly payments to their incomes. According to the DOE’s data, enrollment in these plans for direct loan
borrowers more than doubled in the last two years, from 2.5 million to 5.3 million.
2 More precisely, student loan borrowers in general do not have to start repaying their student loans
immediately after exiting school (or after their enrollment status drops to less than part time). The s
n
“waiting” period after exiting school and before repayment begins is known as the grace period and o
typically lasts six months.
ti
di
3 Additionally, if borrowers are delinquent on at least one student loan in a given quarter, all of their n
balances are treated as being in the repayment phase. o
C
4 For comparability reasons, given the impossibility of knowing which loans are in deferment or g
forbearance statuses in the CCP (which, ideally, should not be included in the calculation of the n
ci
delinquency rate for balances in the repayment period), the calculated rate of federal loan balances in n
repayment includes loans in deferment (for reasons different than being in school or in a grace period), a
n
forbearance, default, and other statuses. Fi

cohort enrolled in higher education in the latter 2000s leaving school and entering the
repayment period for their student debt. Specifically, we estimate that the fraction of
total student loan balances in the repayment period climbed from about 55 percent at the
end of 2010 to 80 percent in 2016:Q2.
Thus, as shown in figure 4, focusing only on student debt in the repayment period in the
CCP, the delinquency rate has been decreasing gradually, but steadily, for almost four
years—a pattern more consistent with the improvements seen in the labor market. In
particular, the delinquency rate for student loans in the repayment period—the solid blue
line—decreased from 18.6 percent in 2012:Q2 to 14.6 percent in 2016:Q2. (The dashed line
represents the delinquency rate when all loans are considered, including those in school
deferment or in a grace period, already shown in figure 2.) This decrease suggests that
much-improved job prospects, increased take-up in IDR plans, and perhaps other factors
have contributed to better student loan performance in recent years.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n c
U
&
The evidence regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty around our projections s
k
s
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate is mixed. On balance, we now see that
Ri
uncertainty as being somewhat higher than before the recent U.S. elections but
nonetheless reasonably well in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). On the one hand, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis index of
economic policy uncertainty—although fluctuating widely from day to day and week to
week—has, on average, been higher since the election than in the months prior. The
options-implied expected volatility associated with longer-term Treasury securities has
also moved up since the election, albeit only modestly. On the other hand, options-based
indexes of expected stock market volatility (for example, the VIX) remain at subdued
levels, as do corporate bond spreads.
We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our medium-term GDP
projection are tilted to the downside, primarily because monetary policy is likely better
positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones. While a rising
federal funds rate implies increasing room for conventional monetary policy actions, in
the staff’s baseline outlook, there is not much room for accommodation in the event of a
moderately large adverse shock over the next couple of years. Although we continue to
view the risks as tilted to the downside, we view those risks as less pronounced than in
the recent past, importantly because risks to the foreign outlook have subsided somewhat.
We view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for
GDP and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.
With regard to inflation, we do not view the current level of uncertainty as
unusually high. We see important risks to inflation on both the upside and the downside,
and we view those risks as roughly balanced. To the downside, some survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are near historically low levels. In
addition, as shown in one of the alternative scenarios, the projected divergence between
domestic and foreign monetary policies could generate greater appreciation of the dollar
than we have anticipated in the baseline forecast. To the upside, with the economy
projected to be operating above its long-run potential, inflation may increase more than

as the narrowing of corporate bond spreads, signals an uptick in valuation pressures to a
notable level. But the stability implications of these building pressures are mitigated by a
number of factors. One is that capital and liquidity buffers at U.S. banks are strong and,
according to the somewhat limited available data, leverage is moderate at nonbank
financial institutions. Moreover, the reduction in assets under management at prime
money funds that occurred through October in anticipation of money market fund reform
has not reversed and points to a modest reduction in the risks associated with maturity
transformation in the money market fund sector. Finally, the volume of credit being
extended to the private nonfinancial sector as a whole remains moderate despite increased
indications of high leverage in the corporate sector, as borrowing by households remains
far below levels experienced late in the previous decade.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario considers the
effects of a future fiscal expansion that is larger and that has a different composition than
in the staff baseline, while the second scenario assumes that the tax cut included in the
staff baseline does not materialize. The third scenario illustrates the effects of greater
momentum in private demand. In the fourth scenario, we examine possible consequences
of lower long-term inflation expectations. We then consider the implications of subdued
labor productivity growth paired with larger increases in wages in the fifth scenario. In
the sixth scenario, we consider the possibility that U.S. monetary policy normalization
leads to a much stronger appreciation of the dollar. The seventh and last scenario
analyzes the consequences of stronger foreign growth and a weaker dollar.

We simulate these scenarios in a variety of staff models, which are indicated in
y
t
the scenario headings.1 For the two fiscal policy scenarios, we assume different n
ai
adjustments to the intercept in the inertial policy rule used in the baseline, as we will r t
e
c
describe in further detail. In the other five scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed n
U
by the same rule as in the baseline. In all cases, we assume that the size and composition &
s
k
of the SOMA portfolio follow the baseline paths. s
Ri
Larger Fiscal Expansion (simulated in FRB/US)
In the baseline projection, the staff is assuming a cut in personal income taxes
equal to 1 percent of GDP debuting in 2017:Q3. In this scenario, we study the effect of a
fiscal expansion that is larger and has a different composition: In addition to the tax cut
considered in the baseline, we assume an increase in government purchases equal to
1 percent of GDP, phased in from 2017:Q3 onward.2 We assume that half of the
additional government spending is directed to public infrastructure.3 In the long run, the
intercept of the policy rule governing the federal funds rate converges to a level that is
25 basis points higher than in the baseline, and the 10-year Treasury rate is revised up
38 basis points.4
Real GDP growth is ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline, on average, in
2018 and 2019, reflecting the effect on aggregate demand of the additional government
spending. The unemployment rate follows a lower path, bottoming out at 3¾ percent in
2020. The tighter resource utilization puts upward pressure on inflation, which reaches
2½ percent by the end of 2021.5 As a result, the federal funds rate follows a steeper path,
reaching 5½ percent in 2021, about 1½ percentage points higher than in the baseline.
1 The models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; EDO, which is an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model; and SIGMA, which is
a multicountry open-economy model.
2 In particular, we assume that the additional government spending is phased in over a four-year
period. Spending returns gradually to the baseline path thereafter.
3 In an effort to capture supply-side effects of additional government spending, we assume that
government investment in physical capital has an annual rate of return of 7 percent, consistent with the
estimate in Congressional Budget Office (2016), The Macroeconomic and Budgetary Effects of Federal
Investment (Washington: CBO, June), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51628. This rate of return,
together with the size and gradual implementation of government spending on infrastructure assumed in
this scenario, implies only a small increment to potential output.
4 These intercept adjustments are consistent with the adjustments that were made in the December
Tealbook to the intercept in the policy rule and the longer-run value of the term premium.
5 In this scenario and the next one, the responses of inflation are likely larger than the revisions
that the staff would implement using its judgmental apparatus, in part because inflation in FRB/US

No Fiscal Expansion (simulated in FRB/US)

Enactment of fiscal expansion is not assured. This scenario posits that the fiscal

U unwind the adjustments to the rule for setting the federal funds rate and to the long-term
&
interest rate term premium made in the baseline projection in the December Tealbook.
s
k
s
Ri
Without the fiscal expansion, real GDP growth is slightly weaker than in the
baseline and unemployment is higher, by about ¼ percentage point starting at the end of
this year. In addition, inflation follows a lower trajectory.6 These developments—as
well as the adjustment to the policy rule—leave the federal funds rate about ½ percentage
point below the baseline at the end of 2020.
Stronger Aggregate Demand (simulated in EDO)
Several indicators of consumer and business confidence have increased
significantly in the past month or two. Furthermore, motor vehicle sales in December
were strong, and there are increasing signs of wage acceleration, which could support
household income and further boost confidence. Motivated by these upbeat
developments, this scenario assumes a considerable improvement in animal spirits, which
spurs faster consumer and business spending.7
In this scenario, real GDP rises 3 percent in 2017, compared with 2¼ percent in
the baseline projection. The unemployment rate falls faster than in the baseline,
bottoming out at around 4 percent by the end of 2018; it then edges up over the remainder
of the forecast period and returns to the baseline level by late 2021. Inflation is little
changed, while the federal funds rate rises more steeply and is as much as ½ percentage
point higher than the baseline in late 2018.8
generally moves more with demand than it does in the staff judgmental projection. More important, to
better capture the long-lasting changes to fiscal policy, we assume model-consistent expectations as
opposed to VAR expectations that are more typical for alternative simulations in FRB/US. It turns out that
the inflation response in these scenarios is larger with model-consistent expectations than with VAR
expectations.
6 For the unemployment rate, this No Fiscal Expansion scenario comes very close to unwinding
the effect of the fiscal policy that was built into the baseline in the December round. For inflation, as noted
previously, the inflation effect is larger than in the staff judgmental apparatus.
7 We generate this scenario by applying a positive shock of one standard deviation to the model’s
main driver of aggregate demand.
8 In some respects, this scenario is similar to the Larger Fiscal Expansion scenario in that both
feature an increase in aggregate demand. However, their macroeconomic consequences are notably

Lower Inflation Expectations (simulated in FRB/US)
y
t
The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of longer-run n
ai
t
inflation expectations of households has been trending down for some time. As we have r
e
c
n
noted in the past, it is not altogether clear that these survey-based readings are relevant
U
&
for actual wage and price setting, and other measures have not moved in this direction.9
s
k
However, in this scenario, we assume that the downtrend is relevant, and we illustrate the s
Ri
risks from inflation expectations that are ½ percentage point lower than in the baseline in
the first quarter of 2017. Thereafter, longer-run expectations are affected by the
economy’s experience of inflation but return to the FOMC’s objective in the long run.
Under these circumstances, headline inflation is only 1½ percent in 2017,
¼ percentage point below the baseline, and rises to only 1¾ percent in 2019. Inflation
remains persistently below target in part because the baseline policy rule does not
respond very aggressively to inflation deviations. The federal funds rate runs about
¼ percentage point lower than the baseline for several years. Real GDP growth and the
unemployment rate are roughly at the baseline, in part because real interest rates on
longer-dated bonds are little changed.
Weaker Productivity and Faster Wage Growth (simulated in FRB/US)
In the baseline, despite an unemployment rate that is persistently below the
natural rate of unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consistent with the modest
response of prices to economic activity seen in recent years. However, we do not claim
to know the relationship between resource slack and inflation with great precision. It is
possible, for example, that wages may prove more sensitive to a tight labor market than
we have assumed, and the resulting higher wages may pass through into higher prices. In
this scenario, wage inflation responds more to economic slack than assumed in the
baseline, resulting in larger gains in labor compensation. Additionally, we assume that
labor productivity growth is slower than in the baseline.
Higher wages and lower productivity imply higher costs of production, and in the
FRB/US model, these higher costs pass through to price inflation. Accordingly, PCE
different, in part because they are simulated in different models. Furthermore, the shocks in the Stronger
Aggregate Demand scenario are calibrated to a typical aggregate demand shock, while the shocks in the
Larger Fiscal Expansion scenario are calibrated to a very specific and long-lasting fiscal expansion.
9 For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s measure of longer-run expectations of unit
costs reported by businesses in the Sixth District is near the middle of its range since its introduction in
2012.

prices accelerate more than in the baseline and rise 2¾ percent in 2019. The weaker path
y
t
n of labor productivity lowers aggregate demand because of reduced permanent income
ai
t
r and raises the unemployment rate above the baseline. At the end of 2020, the
e
c
n unemployment rate is ½ percentage point higher than in the staff projection. The federal
U
& funds rate rises ½ percentage point above the baseline, largely because of higher
s
k
s inflation.
Ri
Stronger Dollar and EME Turbulence (simulated in SIGMA)
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate about 5 percent over the
forecast period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster than markets currently
appear to expect. The normalization of U.S. monetary policy, however, could well cause
a more pronounced and persistent appreciation of the dollar, especially if higher U.S.
interest rates generate financial turbulence in vulnerable EMEs. In this scenario, we
assume that the broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the end of the
year and that EME corporate borrowing spreads rise substantially in the face of persistent
capital outflows from EMEs. Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions in EMEs,
we assume EME central banks tighten monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on
inflation arising from the depreciation of their currencies. All told, foreign GDP growth
runs, on average, about ¾ percentage point below the baseline in 2017 and 2018.
The stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth depress U.S. real net exports.
Consequently, U.S. real GDP growth moderates to about 1½ percent in 2017, nearly
¾ percentage point less than in the baseline. Lower import prices and weaker economic
activity keep core PCE inflation below 1½ percent through 2018. The federal funds rate
follows a shallower path than in the baseline, rising to only 2½ percent by the end of
2019, nearly 1 percentage point lower than in the baseline.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar (simulated in SIGMA)
In our baseline forecast, we see the headwinds facing the foreign economies as
diminishing only gradually as foreign output expands at a modest pace and underlying
inflation slowly edges closer to central bank targets. However, some foreign industrial
production and trade indicators have come in somewhat stronger than expected in recent
months, and the expansion abroad may prove faster, especially if highly accommodative
monetary policies in the AFEs boost aggregate demand more than assumed in the
baseline. In this scenario, we assume that foreign GDP growth rises to about 3½ percent
in 2017 and 2018 and thus averages about 1 percentage point per year higher than under

increasing to 4¼ percent by the end of 2019 compared with 3½ percent in the baseline.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from cc

UU
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&&
ss
kk
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals ss
RRii
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
yy intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
tt
nn
aaii errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
tt
rr
ee Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
cc
nn intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
UU
&& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
ss
kk apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
ss
RRii
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this discussion, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal
funds rate and compare the associated policy paths and macroeconomic outcomes with
those in the Tealbook baseline forecast. The prescriptions of simple rules and optimal
control exercises are generally little changed from the December 2016 Tealbook,
reflecting largely unchanged economic projections. As in December, most simple rules
and optimal control exercises call for a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than
assumed in the staff forecast. We also present a box in which we review the evolution of
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* over the past decade and examine its relationship with
other notions of the stance of monetary policy.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first-difference rule.1 These prescriptions
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output gap and inflation in the near
term, shown in the middle panels. The top and middle panels also include the staff’s
baseline assumption for the path of the federal funds rate.
• The near-term prescriptions of each of the policy rules are slightly below
those in the December Tealbook, reflecting a small downward revision to the
staff’s projection of core PCE inflation in 2017.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which feature no interest rate
smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the near
term than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, or the
Tealbook baseline.
A MEDIUM-TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model, given
the staff’s baseline projection. This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period
(beginning in the current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The
"average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same 12−quarter period
as the Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*. When the current−Tealbook and previous−Tealbook reference periods differ, the column
"Current−Quarter Estimate Based on Previous Tealbook" reports values for the current reference period had the previous−

level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• The current-quarter estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is
0.1 percentage point higher than it would have been if the staff projection of
the output gap over the next 12 quarters had not changed since the December
Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revision to the projected output gap.
Moreover, the current-quarter estimate is 0.4 percentage point higher than the
estimate reported in the December Tealbook; this increase primarily reflects
the rolling over of the reference period, which, given a rising path of the
output gap in coming years, now requires the closing of a larger output gap
than in December.
• At 1.5 percent, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is more than 1 percentage
point above the average level of the real federal funds rate in the staff forecast
for the same 12-quarter period and ½ percentage point above the staff’s
estimate of the real federal funds rate in the long run.
• The real federal funds rate in the baseline staff forecast is, on average, below
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction function assumed
by the staff encompasses several policy considerations in addition to closing
the output gap, most importantly returning inflation to the Committee’s
2 percent objective.
• The increase in Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* in this projection is the most
recent in a series that reflects the gradual improvement in the real economy
since 2011. In the box “Mind the (Output) Gap: A History of Tealbook-
Consistent FRB/US r*,” we examine the real-time history of Tealbook-
consistent FRB/US r* in relation to the average level of the real federal
funds rate.

Mind the (Output) Gap:
A History of Tealbook-Consistent FRB/US r*
The Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* (henceforth, FRB/US r*) is the level of the real
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, closes the output gap
at the end of that period, according to the FRB/US model and given the staff
projection. As such, FRB/US r* summarizes, in a single number, a stance of policy that
focuses on eliminating resource slack over the medium term in the model. Over time,
FRB/US r* has provided information about the current and projected strength of the
economy. FRB/US r* can be at a level that is unattainable by the actual real federal
funds rate because the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates is not
imposed in the computation of FRB/US r*. Moreover, when the ELB is binding, the
s

In figure 1, we show the real-time evolution of FRB/US r* since 2006, along with the
corresponding real-time 12-quarter average of the real federal funds rate in the
contemporaneous baseline staff forecast (henceforth, the average real rate). The
color-shaded areas in the figure indicate the Great Recession and the periods over
which the Federal Reserve conducted its asset purchase programs. In figure 2, we
report the real-time projected 12-quarter averages of the output gap and of headline
inflation (the latter measured in deviations from 2 percent).
In the years before the Great Recession, the staff saw the economy as likely to
operate close to its potential level over the medium term under its baseline monetary
1 The FRB/US r* measure is largely a function of two factors: the staff projection for the output
gap 12 quarters ahead and the staff assumption for the average real value of the federal funds rate
over the next 12 quarters. In this sense, FRB/US r* is simply a summary measure of the underlying
strength of aggregate demand over the medium term in the staff projection, assuming that the staff
assessment of the interest sensitivity of aggregate demand is similar to that embedded in the
FRB/US model. For a discussion of how FRB/US r* relates to other equilibrium interest rate
concepts, see Christopher J. Gust, Benjamin K. Johannsen, David J. Lopez-Salido, and Robert J.
Tetlow (2015), “r*: Concepts, Measures, and Uses,” memorandum to the Federal Open Market
Committee, October 13.
2 That said, the outcomes associated with a policy that implemented FRB/US r* could be close
to those derived from an optimal control simulation, at least in some circumstances. For example, if
demand shocks were the only source of variation in the output gap, optimal control simulations
would seek to prevent the output gap from opening up and would simultaneously keep inflation
near the Committee’s long-run objective at all times. This nexus ceases to exist when supply shocks
are also inducing fluctuations in the output gap.

policy assumptions; accordingly, the average real rate in the staff projection was near
FRB/US r*. This proximity between the average real rate and FRB/US r* continued
into the early phase of the recession. Although the economic outlook deteriorated
appreciably in the first half of 2008, the assumed conventional monetary policy easing
in the staff projection was seen as sufficient to eliminate economic slack in the
medium term.
The worsening of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2008 and early 2009 led to a
marked deterioration of the economic outlook and sharp declines in FRB/US r*. As
the nominal federal funds rate reached the ELB late in 2008, a wide and persistent
disparity opened up between FRB/US r* and the average real rate. Subsequently, the
staff viewed the combination of large-scale asset purchase programs, reinvestment of
maturing principal, and forward guidance regarding the path of the nominal federal
funds rate as bolstering the economic outlook and preventing an even larger disparity
between FRB/US r* and the average real rate.3
By the end of 2013, domestic and global headwinds had abated somewhat. Closing
the output gap over the medium term once again became a plausible scenario, even
without additional asset purchases, allowing FRB/US r* to catch up with the average
real rate in the staff projection. As a consequence of the Committee’s decision to
maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy (to support further
improvements in economic conditions and a return of inflation to 2 percent), the staff
projection for the output gap began to turn positive over the medium term, and
FRB/US r* has exceeded the average real rate noticeably since mid-2015.
The period since 2013 illustrates why FRB/US r* is not necessarily a measure of the
appropriate stance of monetary policy. Although higher real policy rates could
prevent the projected overshooting of output relative to potential output shown in
figure 2, such a decision would further delay the return of inflation to the Committee’s
2 percent objective. With realized inflation having trended below 2 percent since the
onset of the Great Recession, some policymakers may see a strong commitment to
achieving the inflation objective in the coming years as important for ensuring the
credibility of that objective. Moreover, the FRB/US r* concept does not account for
the limits of conventional monetary policy in responding to downside risks in a low
interest rate environment, so risk-management considerations might be playing a role
in the average real rate remaining below FRB/US r*.
3 In figure 1, as the anticipated effects of the asset purchase programs were incorporated into
the staff projection, the average projected output gap became smaller and the disparity between
FRB/US r* and the average real rate narrowed. The timing of the incorporation of new progams
within the staff projection varied. The large-scale asset purchase programs announced in March
2009 and September 2012 were not incorporated into the staff forecast until the subsequent
Tealbook rounds. By contrast, the staff forecasts in November 2010 and September 2011 already
anticipated much of the effects of the second large-scale asset purchase program and the maturity
extension program, respectively.

and the first-difference rule.2 These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the
output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows the paths implied by the
different policy rules.3 Given only small changes to the staff projection since the
December Tealbook, the policy paths prescribed by each rule and the associated
macroeconomic outcomes are also little changed.
• The policy path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the
intercept. In the Tealbook baseline, the nominal federal funds rate increases,
on average, about 80 basis points per year through the first quarter of 2020,
when it reaches 3.5 percent. The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and
the federal funds rate peaks at 4 percent in 2021 before eventually returning to
its longer-run level of 3 percent.
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a constant intercept prescribes a slightly
higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than the version
with a judgmental intercept adjustment used to construct the Tealbook
baseline. The difference in policy rates arising from this alternative intercept
assumption is small and dissipates too rapidly to have marked effects on the
real longer-term interest rates that influence economic activity in the FRB/US
model. Thus, macroeconomic outcomes under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule
are similar to those in the Tealbook baseline.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years, largely
because these two policy rules do not incorporate any interest rate smoothing.
Despite these initially higher policy paths, the macroeconomic outcomes
under these two rules are not far from those under the Tealbook baseline
because of the assumptions that the public immediately understands the
2 Unless otherwise noted, the policy rules and optimal control simulations assume that
policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future and that financial market participants, price
setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also
fully understand the macroeconomic implications of that policy strategy. Such policy strategies are
described as commitment strategies.
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation. This choice of rule
specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation
rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

macroeconomic effects of following the rules and believes the policymakers’
commitment to stabilize the economy in the future. The Taylor (1999) rule
calls for slightly higher policy rates than the Taylor (1993) rule over the
period shown because it responds more strongly to the projected rise in output
above its potential level over the next several years. As a consequence, the
Taylor (1999) rule generates a higher trajectory for the unemployment rate
and a slightly lower trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor (1993) rule.
• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate through the end of 2019 than the Tealbook baseline. Thereafter, the
federal funds rate slowly drifts down to near its longer-run level of 3 percent.
By contrast, the federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline continues to rise
for a while after 2019. This divergence occurs because the first-difference
rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its
level, reacts to the slower pace of economic growth projected late in the
decade and beyond. The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2020, in
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflation in the future,
implies lower longer-term real rates over the entire projection period as well
as higher levels of resource utilization and inflation. Thus, the first-difference
rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are markedly below
the unemployment rate paths generated under the other policy rules and
further below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.4
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy
choices in a way that improves overall economic outcomes, given the baseline outlook.5
As was the case for the simple rules, the federal funds rate paths prescribed by optimal
4
The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix provides technical
details on the optimal control simulations.
5 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve current economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ actions; however, the simulations are not
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

control under each of the four loss functions and their associated macroeconomic
outcomes are nearly the same as in the December Tealbook.
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on changes in the federal funds rate. Under this strategy,
the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook
baseline policy path. This higher path arises because, in the current baseline
projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that the “equal weights”
loss function judges to be costly. A tighter policy results in a path of the
unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook
baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of
inflation (in the model) to lower levels of resource utilization.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below both the path for the case of equal weights and the
Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers
choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate because their
desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this
outcome. The tighter labor market causes inflation to reach 2 percent more
quickly than in the case of equal weights; inflation then runs 10 to 20 basis
points above the Committee’s longer-run objective for the next decade.6
6 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term is time inconsistent in the sense that, given the
opportunity to reoptimize the path of the federal funds rate without regard to past policy commitments,
policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter monetary policy. Under the assumption of
optimal control under discretion with “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences, policy rates and

• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function
that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times
larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise identical.
The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in
the “equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with
undershooting the inflation objective in coming years are larger. The reason
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff
because inflation responds little to resource utilization. Hence, policymakers
would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of
unemployment, which this specification of the loss function sees as costly, in
s

undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment. The paths for the real
federal funds rate and the real 10-year Treasury yield are also higher for a
couple of years than in the case of equal weights. While this policy leaves the
trajectory for inflation almost unaffected, it keeps the unemployment rate
close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rule and optimal control simulations described previously.
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook baseline and optimal control under
commitment. For the other three specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under
commitment and discretion are not much different from each other.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations assume that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers
will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic implications.
Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together, possibly along with others, as a means to assess the various tradeoffs
policymakers may face when pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES”
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported
in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t,
and the right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( and ), the output gap estimate
for the current period (ygap), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the
t 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3|𝑡𝑡
output gap (∆4ygap ). The value of policymakers’ longer-run inflation objective, denoted πLR,
t+3|t
is 2 percent.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1 The

M
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. To isolate the effects of
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate. The “Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model
of the U.S. economy.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012).
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.
3 For a discussion of this and other concepts of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and
others (2016).

which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. It is generated after
the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they match those in
the extended Tealbook forecast. A model simulation then determines the value of the real federal
funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the extended
baseline forecast.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and
the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic
outcomes even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter
period to close the output gap at the end of this time frame, whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time. Distinct paths of real short-term rates can, in turn,
generate different paths for inflation and economic activity.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters have perfect foresight and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealbook
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large-scale asset
purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin
in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( ,
measured a𝑃𝑃s 𝑃𝑃t𝑃𝑃he difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡
rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate. In the following equation, the resulting loss
function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount
factor :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change

components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
s
e
gi relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect
foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that policymakers in the model
see this path as being a binding commitment on their future decisions; the optimal control policy
takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by
policy decisions made prior to the simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a
period that ends sufficiently far in the future that extending that period further would not affect
the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits.
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.
