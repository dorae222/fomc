Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook

Incoming data since the time of the January Tealbook suggest that the economy is DD
nn
continuing to expand at a moderate pace. In general, our assessment of the economic oo
cc
EE
situation is little changed from our previous projection. cc

Real GDP is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 2 percent in the oo
DD
fourth quarter of 2016, the same as in the January Tealbook. We expect GDP growth to
slow to about 1½ percent in the current quarter, reflecting what we judge to be
transitorily weak data for January, and to move back up to 2 percent in the second
quarter. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have continued to improve at a pace
broadly consistent with our expectations. We view the economy as currently operating
slightly above its sustainable level, with real GDP about ½ percent above potential output
and the unemployment rate—at 4.8 percent in January—0.2 percentage point below our
estimate of its natural rate.
For the medium-term projection, we have pushed back the start of the assumed
expansion in fiscal policy to the beginning of 2018. Nevertheless, by the end of 2019, the
level of real GDP is essentially the same as in the January Tealbook, as the negative
effect of the fiscal policy timing change and the weaker-than-expected first-quarter data
are offset by the boost from the higher path for equity prices and the lower path for the
dollar assumed in this projection. Real GDP growth is now projected to be 2 percent in
2017, which is a little less than previously forecast, and 2¼ percent in 2018, ¼ percentage
point more. Real GDP growth is then projected to slow to 2 percent in 2019, partly
reflecting the further gradual normalization of monetary policy assumed in our forecast.
With GDP increasing faster than potential output, the output gap widens to 1¾ percent at
the end of 2019, and the unemployment rate falls to 4.1 percent—nearly 1 percentage
point below our estimate of its natural rate. Both the output gap and the unemployment
rate gap show the same tightness in resource utilization by the end of 2019 as in the
previous projection.
The January inflation data were stronger than we had anticipated. Total PCE
price inflation (measured on a 12-month change basis) is now estimated to have been
1.9 percent in January, and core inflation was 1.7 percent; both measures are
0.1 percentage point higher than we expected in our previous forecast. However, we

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&&

ee
vv The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
ee
DD
the December FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic
nn
oo projection with the one we presented in the December Tealbook.
cc
EE
cc
ttii
Since December, we have revised down our projection for real economic activity in 2017 by
ss
ee
mm about the same amount as we have strengthened it in 2018. The downward revision this
oo
year reflects our assumption that the fiscal policy expansion that we had been expecting this
DD
year will instead materialize next year. In 2018, we have revised up the projection because of
a higher stock price path and a weaker dollar as well as the assumed onset of the fiscal
expansion. On net, the GDP projection is only a touch stronger since December, and the
unemployment rate reaches 4.1 percent at the end of 2019, 0.1 percentage point below our
projection in December.
Reflecting the core PCE price data for January, we have revised up our projection for this
year to 1.8 percent. Our projection for core PCE inflation has also been revised up slightly in
2018 and 2019, but the forecast for total PCE inflation is little changed: We continue to
project that total PCE inflation will move up modestly and reach 1.9 percent by 2019.
With both the outlook for total PCE inflation and the output gap little changed, the funds
rate path from the intercept‐adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline
forecast is about the same as in December through most of the projection period.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Fiscal Policy
 Considerable uncertainty remains about the potential size, timing, and
composition of federal fiscal policy changes that may be enacted. As a result,
we have retained our placeholder assumption that adjustments to fiscal policy
will increase the annual primary budget deficit (that is, the deficit excluding
interest costs) by 1 percent of GDP, and that this fiscal expansion will take the
form of a cut in personal income taxes. However, given that the Congress and
the Administration have not yet coalesced around a specific set of policy
changes, we have pushed back the assumed start of this fiscal expansion from
the third quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018.1 This fiscal expansion is
projected to boost the growth rate of real GDP about ¼ percentage point per
year in 2018 and 2019; these estimates are exclusive of multiplier effects and
any offsets from higher interest rates and the dollar.
 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government
will increase real GDP growth about ¼ percentage point in 2017,
½ percentage point in 2018, and ¼ percentage point in 2019. As a result of
the adjustments to our assumptions for federal fiscal policy, the contribution
of policy actions to real GDP growth is nearly ¼ percentage point less in 2017
and 0.1 percentage point larger in 2018 than in the January Tealbook.2
1 We also incorporated an estimate of the effects of the federal government hiring freeze that was
announced after the January Tealbook, which slightly lowers our projected paths for both federal
employment and real federal government purchases of goods and services. (Compensation of federal
employees is part of these purchases.)
2 By the end of 2020, the effect of the assumed fiscal expansion on the level of real GDP is
unrevised relative to the January projection.

 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current oo
DD
level until the third quarter of 2017 and then begin to contract, as the proceeds
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield for the current quarter is essentially in line with
our January projection. Over the medium term, the 10-year Treasury yield is
still projected to rise significantly, from an average of 2.5 percent in the
current quarter to 3.9 percent by the end of 2019.
 Triple-B corporate bond spreads are about 20 basis points narrower than we
projected in the January Tealbook, and we carried forward part of the
narrower spread in the forecast. The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was
revised up slightly, but only because of a methodological change in the
calculation of these rates.4
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices have risen around 5½ percent since the January Tealbook, more
than we had anticipated. We view this increase as having raised valuation
pressures, which reduces slightly the scope for further stock price appreciation
over the medium term. As a result, equity prices are projected to rise at an
average annual rate of about ¾ percent over the projection period, compared
3 We have maintained the upward adjustment (introduced in the December Tealbook) of
¼ percentage point to the longer-run equilibrium real federal funds rate, which is the intercept of the
baseline policy rule in the long run, to take account of the assumed fiscal expansion. We also maintained
the upward adjustment of ⅛ percentage point to the long-run term premium reflecting the additional supply
of Treasury debt that would be forthcoming with this expansion.
4 The change in methodology raised historical and projected mortgage rates by 18 basis points.
The new method adjusts for the average points and fees paid by prime borrowers of 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages at origination. Our old method assumed points and fees were constant at 1 percent.

cc
ss
ttii
historical relationship with rents, we continue to project that growth in home
ee
mm
valuations will slow to an average annual rate of 4½ percent over the medium
oo
DD
term.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 After an unusually strong increase in the third quarter, total foreign real GDP
growth stepped down to an annual rate of about 2¾ percent in the fourth
quarter of 2016. Recent data suggest that activity is expanding at a moderate
rate of 2½ percent in the current quarter. We expect foreign GDP growth to
stay at that near-potential pace over the forecast period, little changed relative
to the January Tealbook.
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 1 percent since the time of the
January Tealbook, primarily reflecting a sizable depreciation relative to
emerging market currencies. We expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at
an annual rate of roughly 1¼ percent over the forecast period, as market
expectations for the federal funds rate are assumed to move up toward the
staff forecast. Relative to the January Tealbook, the projected path of the
dollar is somewhat lower, reflecting recent dollar depreciation.
Oil and Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has increased about $1 per barrel since the
time of the January Tealbook and is now trading at $56 per barrel, in line with
our January forecast. Spot prices have been supported by reports that OPEC
countries implemented 90 percent of their agreed-upon production cuts in
January. In contrast, the December 2019 futures price has dipped about
$1.50 per barrel and is currently at $55 per barrel, reflecting an upward
revision to the forecast for U.S. oil production over the medium term. In line
with these futures quotes, we forecast that oil prices will decline very
gradually over the projection period.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP oo
DD
After rising at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year,
real GDP growth is expected to slow to 1½ percent in the current quarter. Our estimate
of real GDP growth in the current quarter is about ½ percentage point lower than in the
January Tealbook, reflecting unexpectedly low consumer outlays for services and
surprisingly weak state and local government construction spending data for January.
We offset some of this surprising weakness over the coming months and raised our
projection for real GDP growth in the second quarter to 2 percent. All told, GDP growth
for the first half of this year, at 1¾ percent, is slightly less than in the January Tealbook.
Meanwhile, indicators of consumer sentiment and of business sentiment and activity have
remained high and, for some measures, have increased further. As in the previous
Tealbook, we have tempered our response to the elevated level of these indicators, which
presents an upside risk to the projection (one that is discussed in the alternative scenario
“Stronger Aggregate Demand” in the Risks and Uncertainty section).5
 After increasing 3 percent in the fourth quarter and for 2016 as a whole, real
PCE is expected to rise only 1½ percent in the first quarter. The slow pace of
first-quarter growth reflects a step-down in motor vehicle sales from their
brisk year-end pace, further declines in energy services due to an
unseasonably warm winter, and general softness in the January spending
data.6 We expect spending growth to pick up in the second quarter, in part
5 The median of the first-quarter forecasts within the System, as displayed in the table “Federal
Reserve System Nowcasts of 2017:Q1 Real GDP Growth,” at 2.2 percent, is 0.8 percentage point higher
than the staff’s judgmental projection of 1.4 percent. Some of these nowcasts have taken considerable
signal from the recent increases in consumer and business sentiment and in indicators of business activity.
6 Beginning this year, federal legislation required the IRS to hold any tax refund that includes an
earned income tax credit or a child tax credit until after February 15. The new policy is intended to reduce
fraud and identity theft by allowing time for income verification. Data through late February suggest that
this change has delayed some federal tax refunds relative to earlier years. Analysis by the Joint Committee

following declines earlier in 2016. Given the indicators of business
spending—such as recent net gains in new orders of nondefense capital goods
and further improvements in measures of business sentiment—we expect a
further step up in E&I growth in the first half of this year.8 Investment in
drilling and mining structures also rose in the fourth quarter, its first increase
in two years, but overall spending on nonresidential structures declined as
investment in other structures pulled back from a sizable gain in the third
quarter. We expect spending on nonresidential structures to rise at a
5¼ percent pace over the first half of this year as investment in drilling and
mining structures continues to recover and investment in other structures turns
back up.
 The recent data on housing activity have been above our expectations. Starts
and permits for single-family homes strengthened in the fourth quarter and
remained near that level in January; in addition, sales of existing homes
moved up sharply in January.9 As a result, we expect real residential
investment to rise 8 percent in the current quarter, 6½ percentage points more
than in the January Tealbook. However, we expect increases in mortgage
on Taxation suggests that the effect on the overall level of refunds will be small, and we expect any
shortfall in consumer spending in February to be made up in March.
7 Our reluctance to raise our near-term PCE forecast in response to the higher sentiment figures
reflects our view that a portion of the sentiment boost was likely related to the election, and that some
academic research finds that election-induced movements in sentiment have had little effect on consumer
spending in the past (see Atif Mian, Amir Sufi, and Nasim Khoshkhou (2015), “Government Economic
Policy, Sentiments, and Consumption,” NBER Working Paper Series 21316 (Cambridge, Mass.: National
Bureau of Economic Research, July), www.nber.org/papers/w21316?sy=316).
8 We have taken only partial signal from the upbeat business sentiment readings, as these measures
have, for some time, been somewhat strong relative to the spending data.
9 Some of the recent increase in existing home sales—which affect residential investment (and,
therefore, GDP) through brokers’ commissions—may reflect a boost from prospective homebuyers who are
jumping into the market before mortgage rates increase further.

below the January Tealbook projection.
 Net exports subtracted almost 1¾ percentage points from the rate of real GDP
growth in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a sharp increase in imports of
goods and services. For the first half of 2017, net exports are projected to
subtract about ½ percentage point from GDP growth as imports rise further, in
line with U.S. demand, and as U.S. exports continue to be restrained by past
dollar appreciation.
 After being little changed, on net, since late 2014, manufacturing production
has risen at a modest pace since September. These increases, together with
the continued strengthening in the new orders indexes in the national and
regional manufacturing surveys, suggest that factory output might be
expanding on a more sustained basis. We now project that manufacturing
production will increase at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the first half of this
year, 1 percentage point faster than in the January Tealbook. (See the box
“Recent Developments in the Manufacturing Sector.”)
Real GDP growth is projected to be 2 percent in 2017, to pick up to 2¼ percent in
2018 as our assumed fiscal expansion kicks in, and then to slow to about 2 percent in
2019, reflecting the further gradual normalization of monetary policy. (For an alternative
view, see the box “The Staff Forecast Is Too Strong.”)
 Real GDP ends the medium-term projection at essentially the same level as
the January Tealbook, as the weaker forecast for the first quarter of 2017 and
the later onset of the assumed fiscal expansion are offset by the positive
effects of somewhat more favorable financial conditioning factors—in
particular, the higher path for equity prices and the lower trajectory for the
dollar.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET EE
cc
ttii
ss
ee
The January employment report, which was broadly consistent with our mm
oo
expectations in the January Tealbook, suggests that the labor market has continued to DD
improve and is currently a little beyond full employment.10
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased 227,000 in January, which was
more than accounted for by stronger-than-expected private-sector hiring. In
contrast, government employment unexpectedly fell 10,000 in January, and
estimates for both November and December were revised down to also show
declines. The three-month moving average of total payroll gains was 183,000,
about the same as in our previous Tealbook forecast.11
 We took some signal from the upward surprise in private payrolls in January
and nudged up our forecast of private hiring over the next couple of months.
In contrast, we marked down projected government payrolls to reflect the
federal government hiring freeze.12 All told, total nonfarm payroll
employment is expected to rise about 180,000 per month through the second
quarter, a touch less than previously projected.
 The unemployment rate edged up to 4.8 percent in January, and the labor
force participation rate rose 0.2 percentage point, to 62.9 percent; we had
expected both to be unchanged. Substantially fewer unemployed individuals
10 The employment report for February will be released on March 10, the Friday before the FOMC
meeting.
11 The January employment report included the benchmark revisions to the Current Employment
Statistics (CES). The revisions were minor: Based on the updated CES data, total payroll gains averaged
187,000 per month in 2016, an upward revision of 7,000 per month.
12 The federal government hiring freeze, which was effective January 22 and will last for 90 days,
was instituted after the reference week for the January employment report. We have currently penciled in
declines in federal employment of around 10,000 per month from February through April. Beyond the
90-day period, we project further, though smaller, declines, on average. All told, we now expect federal
employment to fall by 80,000 by the end of the projection period, equal to around 2¾ percent of the federal
workforce.

 Labor productivity in the business sector rose at an annual rate of around
3 percent in the second half of 2016 following a decline in the first half. For
the year as a whole, labor productivity increased 1¼ percent, which exceeded
the average pace over the preceding five years by ¾ percentage point.
The labor market is projected to improve further over the medium term, though at
a slower pace, on average, than in recent years. By the end of 2019, the labor market is
very tight, with the unemployment rate nearly 1 percentage point below our estimate of
its natural rate. This projection is essentially the same as in the January Tealbook.
 Average monthly payroll gains are expected to slow from 170,000 in 2017 to
120,000 in 2019—just a little faster than the pace consistent with no change in
labor market slack.
 Labor productivity enters 2017 somewhat above our estimate of its structural
level. We project that labor productivity will increase a little less than
1 percent per year over the projection period, a bit slower than in 2016 and
slightly below our estimate of its structural pace.13
 After having decreased by 1 percentage point over the previous two years,
the unemployment rate declines another ¾ percentage point over the coming
three years and reaches 4.1 percent at the end of 2019.
 Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population
ratio continue to improve relative to their declining trends.
13 Productivity typically declines relative to its structural level when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly reflecting lesser-qualified workers being drawn into the workforce.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION tt ll
uu
OO
&&
 Core PCE price inflation in January, at a monthly rate of 0.3 percent, was
ll
ee
vv
higher than we were expecting. The upside surprise was concentrated in some ee
DD
categories of goods prices that tend to be volatile, so we did not build in faster nn
oo
cc
price increases in coming months.14 Consequently, on a quarterly basis, our EE
cc
core inflation forecast is noticeably higher in the current quarter than in the ss
ttii
ee
mm
January Tealbook; for the year as a whole, however, core inflation is just
oo
DD
0.1 percentage point higher.
 In the 12 months through January, core PCE prices rose 1.7 percent and total
PCE prices rose 1.9 percent. Both figures are 0.1 percentage point above our
previous projection. We expect the 12-month change in core inflation to
remain close to 1.7 percent over the near term, while the measure for total
inflation is anticipated to move a little above 2.0 percent in February and
March (mainly reflecting earlier declines in gasoline prices dropping out of
the calculation) before easing to 1.8 percent in the second quarter.
 Higher commodity prices, combined with recent dollar weakness, result in
core import price inflation of about 2 percent at an annual rate over the next
two quarters, which would be the largest import price increase in over
five years. Thereafter, we expect import price inflation to slow to a ¾ percent
pace, consistent with moderate foreign inflation, a gradually appreciating
dollar, and slowly declining commodity prices. Changes in core import prices
are estimated to have held down core PCE price inflation by 0.2 percentage
point in 2016, and they are expected to reduce core inflation by 0.1 percentage
point per year over the remainder of the medium term.
 The incoming data on longer-run inflation expectations have not moved much,
on balance, in recent months. Median expectations over the next 5 to 10 years
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged down to
14 January PCE price changes tend to be more volatile than at other times of the year. For
example, both this January and January 2016 saw upside surprises in goods prices that were concentrated in
apparel and durable goods excluding motor vehicles. Some of the unusually high readings on goods price
inflation in January last year were repeated in February, but eventually these prices decelerated and core
goods PCE prices declined for 2016 as a whole. Similar to last year, we view the January 2017 reading on
core goods price inflation as transitorily high, and we expect goods prices will decelerate—but the
uncertainty around the timing is significant.

DD
Total PCE price inflation is anticipated to move up from 1.4 percent in 2016 to
1.9 percent by 2019, while core inflation rises from 1.7 percent to 2.0 percent over the
same period; this forecast is little changed from the January Tealbook. The ¼ percentage
point acceleration in core inflation between 2016 and 2019 mainly reflects the
diminishing pass-through from earlier declines in energy prices and core import prices
along with the further tightening of resource utilization. In addition, we continue to
assume a small pickup (5 basis points in both 2018 and 2019) in the prevailing level of
inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting.
We have received several readings on labor compensation since the January
Tealbook. The evidence for a pickup in wage growth remains mixed, but taken together,
these recent readings appear consistent with a labor market that is operating a little above
its sustainable level against a backdrop of sluggish trend productivity growth.
 Average hourly earnings increased 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in
January after rising at a relatively steady pace of 2 percent earlier in the
recovery. In January, average hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent, a smaller
increase than we had expected.15 Some of the surprise in January reflected an
outsized decline in average hourly earnings of supervisory workers in the
financial-activities sector that we expect to be partly reversed.16 Thus, we
anticipate average hourly earnings to increase at a solid pace in February and
the 12-month change to pick up to 2.9 percent over the next couple of months.
15 The average state minimum wage is estimated to have risen from roughly $8.25 to $8.50 per
hour in January, which we think added about 0.1 percentage point to the change in average hourly earnings
in January.
16 The staff estimates that, excluding the financial-activities sector, average hourly earnings rose
¼ percent in January.

CPH growth to be 3 percent, on average, in the first half of this year and then
to pick up gradually to 3½ percent by 2019 as the labor market tightens
further.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 In the longer run, we continue to assume a natural rate of unemployment of
5 percent and potential GDP growth of 1.7 percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by the beginning of 2022.
 With output above its potential and inflation at the Committee’s 2 percent
objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about 1 percentage point above its
long-run value of 3 percent in 2021 and then moves back toward its long-run
value thereafter.
 Real GDP growth slows to 1½ percent in 2020 and 1¼ percent in 2021 as the
federal funds rate is above its neutral level. The unemployment rate is
4.2 percent in 2020 and rises gradually toward its assumed natural rate in
subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up from 1.9 percent in 2019 to slightly above the
Committee’s long-run objective for a few years before moving back to
2 percent.

Industrial Production. For the 50 years prior to the most recent recession, manufacturing IP and
real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at the same average rate, with manufacturing being
considerably more cyclically sensitive (figure 1). Thereafter, the trends seem to have diverged.
Although both real GDP and manufacturing output bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009,
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 12 percent above its pre-recession peak, while manufacturing
production was still nearly 6 percent below its previous peak, marking its slowest recovery on
record.1 In particular, the recovery for manufacturing has been stalled for the past two years, with
factory output essentially flat over this period.
The recent sluggish performance of manufacturing can be partly explained by weakness in exports.
According to the staff’s flow-of-goods system, negative contributions from exports (the green bars in
figure 2) reduced manufacturing growth in both 2015 and 2016, reflecting in part the sharp appreciation
of the dollar since mid-2014.2 This drag from exports is highly unusual; from 1980 to 2016, exports
contributed, on average, about 1 percentage point to annual manufacturing output growth. Since mid-
2014, manufacturing IP has also been restrained by lower demand for manufactured goods used in oil
and gas drilling and, more broadly, by weak domestic demand for capital goods.
1 Notably, because the data for IP extend back to 1919, this assertion indicates that the most recent recovery
has been even slower than the recoveries following the Great Depression and the end of World War II.
2 With data on industrial production, imports, exports, and demand indicators, the flow-of-goods system
produces model-based estimates of domestic purchases and inventory changes.

Productivity. The recent weakness in IP is also reflected in the slowdown in manufacturing labor OO
productivity growth. Figure 3 plots average labor productivity growth for the manufacturing &&
ll
sector (the red bars) and the broader business sector (the black bars) from 1972 to 2011 and from ee
vv
2012 to 2016. As shown by the first set of bars, between 1972 and 2011, the average annual growth ee
DD
rate for manufacturing productivity was nearly 3½ percent, about 1½ percentage points faster than nn
oo
the growth rate for business-sector productivity. Although the pace of productivity growth for cc
EE
both the manufacturing and business sectors has decreased in recent years, the second set of bars cc
ttii
indicates that manufacturing productivity growth has slowed to an average of less than ½ percent ee ss
mm
since 2012, a much greater slowdown than in the overall business sector.3 Furthermore, the fact
oo
that productivity growth for the manufacturing sector has been slower than that for the business DD
sector is highly atypical for an expansionary period.
Industry-level measures of labor productivity based on the Federal Reserve’s IP data (not shown)
indicate that the slowing in manufacturing productivity growth has been widespread. Of the
263 individual industries that comprise manufacturing IP, more than 80 percent exhibited rates of
labor productivity growth since 2012 that were below their long-run (1972 to 2011) averages, and
nearly 40 percent experienced labor productivity declines over this period. Notably, productivity
growth in high-technology manufacturing industries—which has long been a driver of
manufacturing productivity growth—has been only half its long-run average over the most recent
four years.
Looking forward. Some very recent signs suggest that manufacturing output may be beginning to
turn up. Manufacturing IP has recorded gains (albeit modest) in four of the most recent five
months, the new orders indexes in national and regional manufacturing surveys have risen
markedly to solid levels (figure 4), oil and gas drilling has begun to pick up, and domestic capital
expenditures have begun to show gains. Nonetheless, it is still too soon to determine whether this
modest pickup in the manufacturing sector will be sustained.
3 Measured since the most recent business cycle peak in late 2007—business cycles are common timeframes
for analyzing productivity statistics—manufacturing productivity growth exceeds that for the business sector,
though manufacturing continues to record a sharper slowdown in productivity growth relative to earlier years.

Alternative View: The Staff Forecast Is Too Strong
&&
ll
ee
vv In the March staff forecast, real GDP rises at a 2 percent average annual pace in 2017 and
ee
DD
2018; the unemployment rate drops to 4.2 percent by the end of 2018 and remains near
nn
oo that level through 2020. At the same time, interest rates rise steeply, with the federal
cc
EE
funds rate exceeding 3 percent by the end of 2019 and the 10‐year Treasury yield reaching
cc
ttii
nearly 4 percent. This alternative view argues that the staff’s outlook for real activity is
ss
ee
mm too strong given the steep rise in interest rates.
oo
DD
One way to think about the strength of the staff forecast is through the lens of the
neutral rate of interest, which is the interest rate that is consistent with output growing
at its potential pace, provided that output is initially at its potential level. Because
aggregate spending, according to staff models, is more closely related to long‐term
interest rates than short‐term ones, it is helpful to focus on the neutral long‐term interest
rate—in particular, the 10‐year Treasury yield.
In the staff view, the neutral rate of interest has recently been depressed relative to its
longer‐run value. For example, as of the second quarter of 2016, the staff’s estimate of
the output gap was around zero and had been roughly flat for the preceding few
quarters, which suggests that the level of interest rates at that time should provide a
good estimate of the neutral rate of interest. In the second quarter of 2016, the 10‐year
Treasury yield was 1¾ percent and thus was slightly negative in real terms, assuming
10‐year inflation expectations of 2 percent. Thus, the neutral rate for the real 10‐year
Treasury yield also was slightly negative and well below the staff’s assumed longer‐run
real 10‐Treasury yield of 1.5 percent (3.5 percent in nominal terms less 2 percent inflation).
While the method of inferring the neutral rate of interest described earlier can be used
when the economy is close to potential, another approach is needed over the medium
term, when the unemployment rate moves considerably below its natural rate. An
alternative approach to estimating the neutral rate is through the use of one version of
the optimal control exercises shown in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the
Tealbook—specifically, the variant that assumes a very small penalty on interest rate
changes. The interest rate path in this simulation returns the unemployment rate to its
natural rate by early next year and keeps the unemployment rate near this level
thereafter. Thus, by early next year, the interest rate path in this scenario satisfies the
definition of a neutral rate of interest. As can be seen in the table on the following page,
these simulations imply a high level of the neutral real interest rate in the medium term.
In particular, the real 10‐year Treasury yield in line 2 is around 2¼ percent, higher than the
longer‐run level of 1.5 percent assumed by the staff, shown in the right‐hand column.1
Note: This alternative view was prepared by John Roberts.
1 Over the first few quarters of the simulation, the unemployment rate has not yet reached its
natural rate, so the path of interest rates is not a good measure of the neutral rate of interest over this
period.

The real federal funds rate (line 3) exceeds its long‐run value (of 1 percent) by an even OO
wider margin. &&
ll
ee
vv
The tax cuts assumed in the staff forecast are one identifiable factor boosting the neutral ee
DD
rate in coming years: The tax cuts will support spending and raise the interest rates nn
oo
needed to keep the unemployment rate near its natural rate. To illustrate the effect of cc
EE
the tax cuts, lines 4, 5, and 6 of the table show the results of a similar calculation that cc
ttii
excludes the tax cut.2 Once again, by the end of this year, unemployment is very close to ee ss
mm
its natural rate. As expected, the interest rates in this case—which are a reasonable
oo
approximation to the neutral rate of interest from 2018 onward—are lower. Even so, in DD
this simulation, the real 10‐year Treasury yield—again, a reasonable estimate of the
neutral rate—exceeds the estimate of its longer‐run value, which is 1¼ percent in this
case. It edges up through 2019 before moving down toward its longer‐run value.
An interpretation of this analysis is that in the staff forecast, the “headwinds” that have
restrained growth in recent years (and require a low interest rate to maintain full
employment) shift very rapidly to strong “tailwinds” (which require more restrictive rates
to maintain full employment) that go beyond the readily identifiable factor of the tax
cuts. Without a compelling explanation for these additional tailwinds, a less aggressive
staff forecast would seem appropriate. Separate calculations suggest that a downward
adjustment to the increase in real GDP of around ⅓ percentage point per year over the
medium term—along with the lower interest rate path that our mechanical rule for the
federal funds rate would imply in that case—would be sufficient to eliminate the
overshooting in the neutral rate of interest implicit in the staff outlook. The 10‐year
Treasury yield in this case would be about 40 basis points lower, and the federal funds
rate would rise less steeply, reaching only about 2½ percent by the end of 2019.

2 This alternative is consistent with the “No Fiscal Expansion” alternative scenario in the Risks and
Uncertainty (R&U) section of the Tealbook, though in contrast to the R&U simulation, monetary policy is
assumed here to be set according to optimal control rather than the staff’s baseline policy rule.

Labor Force Participation and Labor Market Flows
&&
ll
ee
vv Since the end of 2013, the labor force participation rate has moved sideways on net
ee
DD
(figure 1). Given its declining trend of about 0.3 percentage point per year as currently
nn
oo estimated by the staff, the flat participation rate over the past three years represents a
cc
EE
cyclical improvement of nearly 1 percentage point. However, the recent behavior of the
cc
ttii
underlying labor market flows—in particular, the decline in labor force entry to a low
ss
ee
mm level—raises the question of whether the participation rate recovery is over.1 The
oo discussion in the box argues that, historically, there is no strong link between labor force
DD
entry flows and cyclical movements in the participation rate.
Figure 2 plots gross labor force entry flows (flows of individuals who move from being
out of the labor force to either employment or unemployment) and gross labor force exit
flows (flows in the opposite direction), normalized by the size of the population.
Intuitively, economic forces that induce an increase in labor force participation—for
example, greater employment opportunities and rising wages—should lead to more
people being pulled into the labor force. However, this behavioral response is difficult to
identify in the data. Indeed, in contrast to the intuition described above, gross labor
force entry flows appear to have been countercyclical during the latest cyclical episode:
They rose during the Great Recession and early in the recovery—a time when the
participation rate was falling—and declined more recently, a period in which the
participation rate has stabilized. Moreover, during the second half of the 1990s, the
participation rate moved well above its estimated trend, as shown in figure 1, despite
gross labor force entry that fell to a very low level by 2000, as shown in figure 2.
1 For example, Krueger (2016) argued that the continued decline in the rate of transition of those
who are out of the labor force back into the labor force suggests that the recovery in participation is
likely to be a short-lived phenomenon. See Alan B. Krueger (2016), “Where Have All the Workers Gone?”

Two factors can help account for the fact that gross labor force entry and exit flows OO
typically move very closely together over time, rather than in opposite directions as &&
ll
intuition would suggest. First, the unemployed are substantially more likely to transition ee
vv
between being in and out of the labor force than are the employed, which can be due to ee
DD
either real transitions or reporting errors of their labor force status in the Current nn
oo
Population Survey.2 Because the level of unemployment increases during a cyclical cc
EE
downturn, both gross entry and exit flows rise, reflecting the churn associated with the cc
ttii
relatively weaker labor force attachment of the unemployed. Then, as the recovery ee ss
mm
proceeds and many unemployed individuals find jobs, their probability of temporarily
oo
dropping out of the labor force (and later rejoining) declines. Second, secular changes in DD
the labor market can affect gross entry and exit flows. For example, older individuals
(retirees) have an appreciably lower probability of moving into and out of the labor force
than the rest of population—thus, population aging leads to a trend decline in both gross
labor force entry and exit flows. Indeed, population aging can account for about one-
fifth of the decline in gross flows since 2010.
In an accounting sense, movements in the participation rate are determined by the net
flow into the labor force (that is, gross entry flows minus gross exit flows). However, the
factors mentioned in the previous paragraph make it difficult to infer from the flows data
how many people are actually reentering (and staying in) the labor force. For example, if
an individual previously on the sidelines of the labor market—sometimes unemployed,
sometimes out of the labor force—finds a stable job, she will push up the participation
rate but also reduce subsequent gross entry and exit flows. Without longitudinal data
that would track the same individuals over long periods, it is challenging to conclude how
much persistent reentry is actually taking place in the labor market and how much the
flows data merely reflect changes in excess churn between unemployment and out of
the labor force. As a result, observations about gross labor force entry flows alone are
insufficient to pin down the remaining potential for cyclical improvement in labor force
participation.
2 Reporting errors are more prevalent for the unemployed; see James M. Poterba and Lawrence H.
Summers (1986), “Reporting Errors and Labor Market Dynamics,” Econometrica, vol. 54 (November),
pp. 1319–38.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
After an unusually strong third quarter driven by bouncebacks in economic
activity in Canada and Mexico, total foreign growth eased to an annual rate of 2¾ percent
in the fourth quarter, still about ½ percentage point higher than its average pace over the
past two years. Recent data suggest that growth will edge down further in the current
quarter to 2½ percent. The forecast is little changed, as greater-than-expected momentum
in the euro area and less-than-anticipated drag from Brexit in the United Kingdom are
offset by downward revisions to Mexico.
k
o
o
We see growth abroad remaining at about 2½ percent, which we judge to be near l
t
u
O
its potential pace, over the remainder of the forecast period. The effects of a cyclical
&
recovery in several South American economies are counterbalanced by moderating e l
v
e
growth in China. In addition, near-term foreign activity should be supported by positive D
n
sentiment, and growth throughout the forecast period is sustained by accommodative o
c
E
monetary policies.
l
’
t
n
I
We continue to see global downside risks as having become somewhat less
prominent since last year. We also envision more upside risks. For example, firming
monthly indicators and the improvement in foreign financial market conditions could
signal more buoyant economic growth abroad than in our baseline. (See the “Stronger
Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty
section.) However, the upcoming elections in several European economies are a source
of concern; should anti-EU forces gain influence and threaten the breakup of the euro
area, financial conditions would likely deteriorate across Europe and beyond, weighing
on activity. (See the “Heightened Risk of EU Breakup” alternative scenario in the Risks
and Uncertainty section.) In addition, Mexico and other EMEs could suffer from
disruptions related to rising U.S. interest rates and uncertainty regarding U.S. trade
policy, as we have highlighted in previous Tealbooks. Finally, the risk of a hard landing
in China is always present.
Inflation in the AFEs rose from an annual rate of 0.8 percent in the third quarter to
1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, and it is expected to rise to almost 2½ percent in the
current quarter, largely reflecting pass-through of higher oil prices and currency
depreciations to retail energy prices. We see AFE inflation moderating to 1½ percent in
the second quarter as the boost from higher energy prices recedes and then edging up to
Page 41 of 122

--- Page 45 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) March 3, 2017
1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period as core inflation firms. With inflation
generally remaining below central banks’ targets, we continue to expect monetary policy
in the AFEs to stay accommodative throughout the forecast period.
We see inflation in the EMEs rising to an estimated annual rate of 4½ percent in
the current quarter from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, as the boost from higher
gasoline prices and peso depreciation in Mexico more than offsets lower inflation in
China. Thereafter, EME inflation should moderate and settle slightly above 3 percent by
the end of this year. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate
50 basis points, and we envision further tightening this year. In contrast, in Brazil, where
k
o inflation surprised on the downside, the central bank cut its policy rate 75 basis points,
o
l
u t and we see further loosening.

n • Euro Area. Recent indicators—such as February PMIs and January confidence
o
c
E readings—suggest that GDP growth will increase to slightly above 2 percent in the
l
’
t
n first quarter, up from 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, and almost ½ percentage point
I
more than projected in the January Tealbook. However, sovereign bond spreads for
France and several other countries have widened as recent polls suggest that anti-EU
candidates may fare well in several upcoming national elections. We now see
political uncertainty leading to further financial stresses, and we marked down
slightly our growth outlook for the second half of 2017 because of the persistent
effects of these stresses. (More details are in the box “Political Uncertainty and the
Economic Outlook for the Euro Area.”) Accordingly, we project that GDP growth
will slow to 1¾ percent in the remainder of 2017 and then edge up to almost 2 percent
by 2019 as the drag from elevated political uncertainty wanes and monetary policy
remains stimulative.
Recent data suggest that, after reaching 2 percent in the fourth quarter, headline
inflation jumped to 3½ percent in the current quarter on the back of surprisingly
strong hikes in retail energy prices. We expect inflation to fall back to 1¼ percent by
midyear as the boost from energy prices fades and then to edge up to 1½ percent later
in the forecast period as diminishing slack leads to some firming of core inflation.
Thus, we anticipate that the European Central Bank (ECB) will start tapering its
purchases at the beginning of 2018, ceasing them entirely by midyear. We assume
Page 42 of 122

--- Page 46 ---

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) March 3, 2017
that the ECB will reinvest the proceeds of its program throughout the forecast period
and keep policy rates at their current very low levels until late 2019.
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth rose from 2.3 percent in the third quarter to
2.9 percent last quarter, driven by a sharp rebound in exports. With export growth
projected to normalize and given a slight weakening in activity data, we see growth
slowing to near 2 percent in the first quarter and holding just below that pace for the
rest of the year. This projection is a little higher than in the January Tealbook, as
faster-than-expected growth in the second half of 2016 led us to rethink the drag from
Brexit-related uncertainties. Even so, we continue to project that growth will
k
moderate a bit further to 1¾ percent in 2018 and 2019 as the prospect of reduced o
o
l
trade with the rest of Europe begins to weigh on investment and spending. t
u
O
&
We expect inflation to rise to 3½ percent in the first quarter, mainly as a result of past l
e
v
sterling depreciation, before gradually falling back to the Bank of England’s (BOE) e
D
n
2 percent target by 2019. In its February Inflation Report, the BOE stated that weak
o
c
E
wage growth signaled more slack in the labor market than it previously thought, and
l
’
t
also repeated that it was likely to see through the transitory spike in inflation. n
I
Accordingly, we now anticipate the first rate hike to occur in the second half of 2018,
almost a year later than assumed in the January Tealbook. We also assume that the
BOE will continue purchasing corporate bonds through the first quarter of 2018 and
will maintain the stock of its government bond purchases at £435 billion through the
end of 2019.
• Canada. Real GDP grew 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, somewhat above our
estimate in the previous Tealbook, driven in part by solid private consumption.
January’s strong manufacturing PMI and solid employment gains suggest ongoing
momentum, and we expect GDP growth of 2¼ percent in the current quarter.
Thereafter, with the output gap closed, growth should settle at its trend pace of
1¾ percent by mid-2018.
• Japan. Fourth-quarter real GDP growth moderated to 1 percent. Although private
investment and exports picked up, private consumption was flat. Recent data have
also been mixed. Merchandise exports declined in January, but the PMIs through
February improved further. Taken together, these changes suggest that GDP growth
will remain near 1 percent in the first quarter, a pace above potential. Going forward,
we see economic activity continuing to expand at a similar rate through 2018,

Political Uncertainty and the Economic Outlook for the Euro Area
In recent months, market participants have focused increasingly on the rise of anti–European
Union (EU) sentiment in euro-area member states. As a result, sovereign spreads in some euro-
area countries have widened noticeably, as shown in figure 1. This discussion reviews the key
political uncertainties and outlines potential implications for the euro-area economic outlook.
National elections will be held this year in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy
(figure 2). In all four countries, voter support for anti-EU parties has increased substantially
compared with recent decades. Although pro-EU parties appear likely to maintain control over
the German parliament by a wide margin, recent polls suggest that an anti-EU party could win a
plurality of votes in the Dutch parliamentary election (Geert Wilders’s PVV, or Party of Freedom;
dark blue bar in figure 3) and in the first round of the French presidential election (Marine Le
k
o Pen’s National Front party; dark blue bar in figure 4).
o
t
l
u
O The apparent popularity of these anti-EU parties has renewed fears about the integrity of the
& currency union. In France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the most prominent anti-EU
l
e politicians have called for a referendum to withdraw from the EU and, hence, the currency
v
e union. Moreover, in France and the Netherlands, anti-EU politicians have explicitly advocated
D
n the reintroduction of national currencies (and in France, the redenomination of sovereign debt
o
in the new national currency). In Italy, the populist Five Star Movement has called for a
c
E
referendum on Italy’s membership in the euro area.
l
’
n
t
I
Uncertainties in France intensified during the intermeeting period. A corruption scandal
weakened François Fillon, the presidential candidate from the pro-EU center-right party, raising
the perceived likelihood that Marine Le Pen could win the presidency. As a result, French
sovereign spreads (red line in figure 1) rose to their highest levels in more than four years.
Because we expect heightened political uncertainty and the associated market volatility to
remain a headwind for the euro-area economy, we marked down slightly our projection of the
region’s growth in 2017.
Nevertheless, our baseline outlook assumes that the influence of anti-EU parties will ultimately
be contained, a referendum on EU membership will not be held in a euro-area member state,
and political issues will not derail the recovery. Our thinking is based on two considerations.
First, current polls suggest that anti-EU parties are unlikely to win exclusive control of a national
government in the euro area (figures 3 through 5). In France, the presidential election will likely
involve a second-round runoff (based purely on the popular vote) between the two leading
candidates from the first round, and this structure tends to favor centrist candidates. In the
Netherlands, Wilders’s party is polling at less than one-fifth of survey respondents. Thus, in
both countries, even if anti-EU parties fare somewhat better than polls suggest, they will likely
still need support from other parties—many of which remain strongly in favor of the currency
union—in order to govern. Second, constitutional laws set strict requirements for holding a
referendum in France, the Netherlands, and Italy. Without a supportive governing majority, it
may be very difficult to hold a legal referendum on EU or euro-area membership.1
1 For example, in France, normally a minimum requirement for a referendum is the consent of the
president’s cabinet (which can remain in power only if supported by a majority of lawmakers) or the legislature.
In the event of gridlock between an anti-EU president and a more moderate cabinet and legislature, there
would likely be a legal dispute over the president’s authority to call a referendum.

Polls are subject to considerable uncertainty, however, especially in light of French survey
evidence that many voters are unsure about their voting intentions. Anti-EU parties could
strongly outperform recent polls, which could substantially pressure other parties to support
their policies.
If a referendum on the EU is held in a euro-area country and substantial momentum builds
toward an EU exit, fears of a breakup of the euro area could intensify significantly. In such a
scenario, financial stresses would escalate across the region, weighing heavily on euro-area
economic activity and perhaps generating significant spillovers to the United States. Even if the
referendum was ultimately voted down, consistent with surveys indicating that a majority of
euro-area citizens wish to remain in the currency union, there could be significant financial
k
and economic disruptions in the meantime. An adverse scenario along these lines is o
o
examined in more depth in the “Heightened Risk of EU Breakup” scenario in the Risks and

result of a planned consumption tax hike.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• Mexico. Real GDP grew a solid 2.9 percent at an annual rate last quarter, down from
an unusually high pace of 4.3 percent in the third. Growth was supported by solid
household demand and rapid export growth. However, tighter financial conditions, a
surge in inflation, and continued uncertainty over U.S. trade policy have led to a
striking drop in consumer and business confidence, which appear to be weighing on
k household demand and private investment. Accordingly, we see GDP growth
o
o
l dropping sharply to 1½ percent in the first half of this year. Growth should recover to
t
u
O 2½ percent by 2019, helped by the peso’s recent depreciation and boosted, further
&
l out, by past reforms to the energy sector. Relative to the January Tealbook, we
e
v
e revised down growth over the forecast period about ¼ percentage point as a result of
D
n
greater uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. trade policy.
o
c
E
l
’
t On the back of sharp hikes in fuel prices and peso depreciation, Mexican headline
n
I
inflation has surprised on the upside, rising to a 12-month rate of 4.7 percent in
January from 3.3 percent in December. In response, the Bank of Mexico increased its
policy rate a further 50 basis points, more than the 25 basis points we anticipated,
bringing the cumulative increase since late 2015 to 3¼ percentage points. We see
12-month inflation falling to 3¾ percent by early next year and settling a little above
the 3 percent midpoint of the target range by the second half of 2018. On February
21, the Mexican authorities announced that they will offer up to $20 billion in a
foreign exchange hedging instrument to support the peso if necessary.
• Brazil. Monthly indicators through December suggest that Brazil’s economy
continued to contract in the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower pace. A recent
strengthening in industrial production and improved confidence indicators suggest
that Brazil will pull out of recession in the current quarter. Even so, we expect the
recovery to be slow, with GDP rising a tepid 1½ percent in 2017 as rising
unemployment and household deleveraging continue to weigh on consumer spending.
Further out, with fiscal reforms supporting confidence and monetary policy easing,
we see growth rising to a little over 2 percent.

Inflation has continued to decline, with the 12-month rate reaching 5.4 percent in
January, just below the upper bound of the central bank’s target range. This decline,
coupled with weak economic activity and a strengthening currency, led the Brazilian
central bank to reduce its policy rate a further 75 basis points to 12¼ percent at its
February meeting, as we expected.
• China. We estimate that real GDP growth will edge down to just below 6½ percent
in the current quarter. Recent measures to cool the housing market will likely weigh
on growth, although an improvement in PMIs through February suggests that the
services and exports sectors will pick up. We see growth slowing to 5¾ percent by
k
2019 as potential growth declines. However, downside risks to the outlook remain o
o
l
significant, including the possibility of a sharp adjustment in the property market, a u t
O
run on the financial system, and a destabilizing currency depreciation. &
l
e
v
After dipping to 1.3 percent in the third quarter, headline consumer price inflation e
D
n
bounced back to 2.6 percent in the fourth. We see consumer price inflation remaining o
c
E
around 2½ percent over the forecast period, but, given sharp increases in producer
l
’
t
prices (following years of declines) and some increase in consumer services inflation n
I
in recent months, there is some upside risk to this outlook.
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth slowed to 3½ percent last quarter from a
little under 4 percent in the third quarter. This slowdown to some extent reflects a
step-down in Indian growth from 7.6 percent in the third quarter to 4.6 percent in the
fourth, in part because of the abrupt removal of 500- and 1000-rupee bank notes from
circulation. Elsewhere in the region, the growth picture in the fourth quarter was
mixed. External demand, as reflected in a pickup in high-tech exports and
manufacturing activity, is supporting activity in much of the region. However, in
some economies—most notably Korea and Taiwan—weak domestic demand appears
to be more than offsetting the momentum from external demand. Overall, we see
growth in the region rising back to 3¾ percent in the near term—partly as India’s
economy rebounds—and settling at around 3½ percent by next year.

Financial Market Developments
Financial markets were generally quiet over the intermeeting period, although
broad equity price indexes continued to climb, further stretching valuation pressures in
that market. Market-based odds of an increase in the target range for the federal funds
rate at the March meeting surged late in the period, prompted by comments by Federal
Reserve officials. Market expectations of the level of the federal funds rate beyond the
near term—as well as Treasury yields, inflation compensation, and the exchange value of
the dollar—all experienced relatively small net changes.
 Based on market quotes, the odds of an increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate at the March meeting moved up from about 25 percent to
roughly 80 percent. Market-based expectations for the level of the federal
funds rate from mid-2017 through the medium term rose about 15 basis points
on average.
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities for maturities of 5 years or less were up
around 15 basis points, while yields for maturities of 10 years or longer
increased only slightly on net.
 TIPS-based inflation compensation decreased 10 basis points at the 5-year
s
t
e
horizon but was little changed at the 5-to-10-year horizon. k
r
a
M
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose about 5 percent. Near-term option- l
a
ci
implied stock price volatility remained near the lower end of its range over the n
a
n
past several years. Corporate bond spreads were little changed for Fi
investment-grade firms but narrowed some for speculative-grade firms.
 AFE and EME equity indexes increased 3½ percent and 2 percent,
respectively, since the February meeting.
 The broad dollar index was about unchanged, as an appreciation against AFE
currencies was offset by a depreciation against EME currencies.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
On net, Federal Reserve communications over the period appear to have raised
expectations of a rate hike at the March meeting. Market participants’ expectations for
the path of the federal funds rate in the medium term also moved up somewhat but were
little changed at more distant horizons. The Committee’s decision to keep the target
range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the February FOMC meeting was well
anticipated. The Chair’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report testimony on February 14
was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting a slightly higher
probability of monetary policy tightening in the near term. Subsequently, investors
reportedly took note of the mention in the February FOMC meeting minutes that many
FOMC participants thought it may be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate fairly
soon. However, FOMC participants were also described as seeing only a modest risk that
inflation pressures would increase significantly. Late in the period, communications
from several Federal Reserve officials seemed to prompt market participants to
substantially revise up the probability they attached to an increase in the target range for
the federal funds rate at the upcoming meeting.
Overall, based on federal funds futures prices, the risk-neutral probability of an
increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the March meeting moved up
substantially, from about 25 percent to around 80 percent. The expected level of the s

Over the intermeeting period, nominal Treasury yields moved up somewhat for
Fi
maturities of five years or less. Nominal Treasury yields for longer-dated maturities were
little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, although they rose notably late in the
period amid comments by various Federal Reserve officials. Treasury yields reacted only
modestly to domestic economic data releases that were reportedly seen as somewhat
better than expected, on balance, but yields were somewhat sensitive to news regarding
political uncertainties in Europe. TIPS-based inflation compensation at the 5-to-10-year
horizon was also little changed, on net, since the February FOMC meeting. Both
nominal Treasury yields and inflation compensation remain notably higher than levels
that prevailed prior to the November elections.

Continuing the patterns seen since the November elections, broad U.S. equity
price indexes rose, on net, since the February FOMC meeting, likely reflecting an
increase in risk tolerance among equity market investors. The equity risk premium
decreased a bit further and now stands in the lower quartile of its historical distribution
since 1985. Stock prices rose across most industries, and equity prices for financial firms
outperformed broader indexes. Meanwhile, spreads on yields of nonfinancial corporate
bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed for
investment-grade firms but narrowed some for speculative-grade firms.
Equity prices of the top six bank holding companies (BHCs) showed a further
step-up following the President’s executive order on February 3 regarding core principles
for regulating the U.S. financial system and have subsequently remained at higher levels.1
In addition, CDS spreads of the largest BHCs declined slightly following the executive
order. Moreover, consensus yearly earnings expectations have improved for fiscal year
2017 for most large BHCs over the past month.
Foreign Developments
Foreign market conditions were generally positive over the intermeeting period,
with equities rising, reflecting positive earnings and improved economic indicators.
Sentiment was particularly buoyant toward emerging market economies: EME exchange
rates have moved up, EME bond spreads have narrowed, and flows to EME mutual funds
have picked up. Financial market conditions were more mixed in the AFEs. AFE t s
e
k
exchange rates and sovereign yields have moved down and French spreads were volatile, r
a
M
in part due to heightened political uncertainty in Europe.
l
a
ci
n
On balance, the value of the broad dollar index is about unchanged since the a
n
Fi
FOMC meeting. Consistent with positive sentiment toward the EMEs, the dollar
depreciated 1¼ percent against EME currencies. The dollar weakened 4 percent against
the Mexican peso, which benefited from the Bank of Mexico’s announcement of a
$20 billion program offering hedges against peso depreciation and a 50 basis point
increase in the policy rate. In contrast, the dollar rose 2½ percent against AFE
currencies, including a 2¾ percent increase against the euro, driven by monetary policy
divergence and heightened political risks in Europe.
1 Increases in bank stock prices may reflect investors’ expectations of lighter bank regulations,
lower taxes, and higher interest rates that would boost large banks’ profits.

Concerns that the anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen could win the French
presidential election this spring and uncertainty about the future of the European financial
assistance program for Greece were drivers of asset price movements in Europe (see the
box “Political Uncertainty and the Economic Outlook for the Euro Area” in the
International Economic Developments and Outlook section). French sovereign spreads
widened as much as 19 basis points but retraced as polls indicated less likelihood of a
Le Pen victory. German 10-year yields have declined 12 basis points since the February
FOMC as investors sought safer assets. Despite these developments, euro-area stocks
increased 4½ percent, in line with other advanced-economy equity markets, lifted by
positive earnings and economic data as well as the weaker euro.
U.K. 10-year yields also declined notably. A dovish assessment of U.K. labor
market slack by the Bank of England at its February 2 policy meeting and weaker-than-
expected U.K. inflation and retail sales data contributed to a 21 basis point decline in
24-month-ahead policy expectations. Meanwhile, Japanese 10-year government bond
yields rose to 15 basis points early in the period, leading the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to
purchase more bonds in the 5-to-10-year segment than expected. The Japanese 10-year
yield ended the period at 7 basis points, in line with the BOJ’s target of around 0 percent.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Over the intermeeting period, conditions in domestic short-term funding markets
remained stable. The effective federal funds rate held steady at 66 basis points except for s
t
e
typical softness at month-ends, and overnight Eurodollar rates were generally at about k
r
a
that level as well. Overnight Treasury repo rates generally remained just a little above M
l
a
the ON RRP rate. ci
n
a
n
On March 15, the debt limit suspension period ends, and the Treasury Department Fi
is expected to have reduced its cash balance at the Federal Reserve to $23 billion.2 The
staff projects that the Treasury will reduce net bill supply by about $85 billion between
March 3 and March 15. This action may have spillover effects into the repo market,
including possible increased take-up at the ON RRP facility.
2 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 stipulates that the Secretary of the Treasury shall not increase
the cash balance “above normal operating balances.” This wording has been broadly interpreted to be
$23 billion, which was the opening cash balance on November 2, 2015, when the suspension was signed
into law. Assuming the debt ceiling will not be raised, on March 16, 2017, the Treasury will begin to take
“extraordinary measures” to remain under the debt limit. With the availability of these measures as well as
April’s typically large tax receipts, the Treasury is not expected to hit the debt limit before the fall of 2017.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households have remained
generally accommodative in recent months and continue to be supportive of economic
activity.
 Credit flows to large firms have remained solid, with particularly strong
investment-grade corporate bond issuance and leveraged loan originations.
 Loans continued to be largely available for most households and for small
businesses, though small business credit demand has remained subdued.
 Over a longer horizon, and against the backdrop of financing conditions that
have remained accommodative overall, some borrowers appear to be facing
modestly higher borrowing costs as a result of the gradual removal of
monetary accommodation since late 2015.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Nonfinancial Corporate Debt and Equity
Gross issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds remained strong in January
and February. Although speculative-grade issuance has been subdued in recent months
on average, bond spreads for riskier firms remained at the lower end of their range over
the past few years. Credit quality of nonfinancial corporations has stayed solid, and Wall
Street analysts continue to project robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over the next
year, even as fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have come in about flat relative to
the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial
firms remained solid in January and February on average, primarily reflecting a robust
pace of seasoned offerings.
In the leveraged loan market, increased appetite from institutional investors has
s
n
led to more favorable financing conditions in recent months. Leveraged loan mutual o
ti
funds in particular have experienced persistent and significant inflows since October, in
di

leveraged loan issuance reached about $75 billion—the highest monthly level since
February 2013—with roughly three-fourths of that being for refinancing purposes.
Nevertheless, total outstanding institutional leveraged loans edged down, as loan
paydowns outpaced gross issuance.
C&I loans on banks’ books were little changed in January and February. The
recent slowdown in C&I loan growth is largely a result of loan paydowns at large banks
and branches and agencies of foreign banks, which tend to serve large clients that have
access to the institutional leveraged loan market.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained accommodative in
recent months. CRE loans on banks’ books continued to grow, and triple A CMBS
spreads were little changed. However, the volumes of CMBS issuance and of deals in the
pipeline have been lower this year through February compared with the same time period
in each of the prior two years. Market commentators attribute some of the CMBS
slowdown to issuers digesting the risk retention rules that took effect in late 2016.
Finally, although the delinquency rate on loans in CMBS pools continued to rise in the
past couple of months, lenders are not expected to tighten underwriting standards (see the
box “What Are the Implications of the Sharp Rise in the CMBS Delinquency Rate for
Financing Conditions in This Market?”).
Small Businesses
Credit supply to well-established small businesses remained generally available.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) index on small business
optimism increased substantially at the end of last year and now stands at its highest level
since 2004, likely reflecting expected changes in the regulatory and tax environment
under the new Administration. However, results from the January SLOOS suggest that
increased optimism has not yet translated into stronger loan demand from small
businesses. In addition, utilization rates of existing lines of credit and NFIB survey
results on planned capital expenditures remain low.

What Are the Implications of the Sharp Rise in the Delinquency Rate
for Commercial Mortgage‐Backed Securities in This Market?
The delinquency rate for commercial mortgages in corporate mortgage‐backed securities
(CMBS) pools has increased since the spring of 2016, raising concerns about whether
signs of distress in CMBS financing conditions are emerging (the left panel of figure 1). In
this discussion, we show that the increase in delinquencies is confined to loans from the
2006–07 CMBS pools, we project the evolution of the delinquency rate, and we describe
why the projected increase is unlikely to indicate an adverse change in CMBS financing
conditions.
As shown in the right panel of figure 1, the key driver of the increase in the aggregate
CMBS delinquency rate is the set of loans from the 2006–07 legacy vintage.1 These loans
were originated at a time when CMBS underwriting was very loose; such standards have
since tightened substantially. Loans in CMBS pools typically have a 10‐year term and are
generally not fully amortizing—generally, the large maturing balloon balances need to be
refinanced to avoid default. As of 2016:Q4, of the original $394 billion of loans from the
2006–07 vintage, about $227 billion had been refinanced and $70 billion had been charged
off, leaving roughly $96 billion of loans outstanding, most of which are expected to
mature by the end of 2017. Out of this outstanding volume, roughly $16 billion of loans
were delinquent in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that an additional $12 billion will
likely default in 2017 because of their inability to refinance their maturing balances in the
CMBS market, given today’s more stringent underwriting.2
1 The delinquency rate of the post‐crisis CMBS loans remains low, although some of the loans used
to finance retail properties in regional markets have shown some signs of distress in recent months.
2 The volume of loans expected to default would be even higher had we used loan characteristics at
origination—the strong rebound of commercial real estate property prices and decrease in interest
rates since the crisis have produced significant improvements in the updated credit profiles of these
loans. In contrast, the volume of expected defaults would be lower if some of loans manage to
refinance outside of the CMBS market. Staff analysis indicates that since 2015, roughly half of the loans
originally financed in the CMBS market have been refinancing their loan balances post‐crisis using non‐
CMBS funding. This share appears to have picked up somewhat since 2015.

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) March 3, 2017
We expect these future defaults to cause the delinquency rate on the 2006–07 vintage to
continue to rise significantly over the course of this year (the red line in the left panel of
figure 2).3 The defaulting loans will boost the delinquency rate of the 2006–07 vintage
for some time, as defaults continue to affect the numerator of the delinquency rate until
they are resolved. In addition, loans on fundamentally solid properties that are able to
refinance at the end of their original terms drop out of the 2006‐07 CMBS vintage,
causing the denominator of the delinquency rate to contract quickly and the rate itself to
spike. By the end of 2017, most remaining loans in the 2006–07 vintage should be
resolved one way or another. Overall, the projected increase in the delinquency rate of
the 2006–07 vintage will drive up the aggregate delinquency rate in the first half of 2017,
as shown in the right panel of figure 2, even if the delinquency rate for the post‐crisis
vintages remains near zero. As the volume of outstanding 2006–07 loans is projected to
dwindle over time, the contribution of these loans to the aggregate delinquency rate will
decline, and the aggregate delinquency rate should start to fall again in the second half of
this year.
We believe that the projected rise in the aggregate CMBS delinquency rate is unlikely to
portend an adverse change in CMBS financing conditions for three reasons. First, the
projected delinquency rate remains well below the levels seen during the financial crisis.
Second, unlike during the financial crisis, the projected increase in the delinquency rate is
not caused by broader market distress or a shock to property values or rents. Third, the
increase has been long anticipated by market participants. According to market sources,
the increased credit risk associated with the 2006–07 vintage is already priced in by the
markets. Indeed, combining our projected default rate for outstanding 2006–07 loans
with a reasonable assumption on loss severity, our estimate of cumulative losses for this
vintage appears to be fairly well aligned with reported estimates of investors’ current
expectations of these losses.

obligation and revenue) over comparable-maturity Treasury securities increased a bit.
The credit quality of state and local governments generally improved further, as the
number of ratings upgrades notably outpaced the number of downgrades in January and
February, mainly because of rating changes for general obligation bonds.
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over
the intermeeting period, as mortgage credit continued to be available for borrowers with
strong credit scores and documented incomes. In January and February, the interest rate
on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages moved sideways after having risen with Treasury yields,
on net, since November. Closed-end residential mortgage loans on banks’ books were
about flat in January and February, while banks’ holdings of home equity lines of credit
continued their long contraction.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative over
the past few months on balance. Consumer credit continued to increase at a 6½ percent
year-over-year rate in December 2016, reflecting similar growth rates in the credit card,
automobile, and student loan segments. Financing conditions in the ABS market
remained favorable, while the growth of consumer lending at banks continued in January
and February, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter of 2016. The notable
exception to the generally accommodative financing conditions for consumers is the still-
tight standards on subprime credit card lending.
Overall, household debt continued to increase at a moderate pace in the fourth
quarter, and the ratio of household debt to disposable income moved sideways again.
Household net worth also increased in the fourth quarter, primarily because of additional
sizable increases in home and equity market prices. The ratio of household net worth to
disposable income, which has hovered at an elevated level for a few years, edged up a bit
further to near its historical high.

points and 20 basis points, on net, respectively, reflecting the change in the stance of
monetary policy as well as other factors.
Discerning the effects of the removal of accommodation on financing conditions
is challenging. The change in monetary policy has been fairly modest, and financing
conditions are also affected by other factors, such as changes in demand for credit or
movements in risk premiums resulting from shifting investor sentiment.
Nonetheless, monetary policy actions since late 2015 appear to have led to
modestly higher borrowing costs in some credit market segments. For example, interest
rates on newly extended bilateral (that is, nonsyndicated) LIBOR-priced loans have risen
about 60 basis points, as LIBOR increased while spreads stayed roughly constant. C&I
loan expansion has continued over this period on net. In addition, rates on nonfinancial
commercial paper have risen roughly in line with the federal funds rate, while the
outstanding amount is little changed on balance.
For some other segments of business credit markets, the effects of the gradual
removal of policy accommodation on financing rates have likely been tempered or offset
by other factors. In the leveraged loan market, the prevalence of interest rate floors has
mitigated the effects of increases in LIBOR since late 2015, as LIBOR has generally
remained below the floors. However, further increases in LIBOR will likely pass through
to interest rates on leveraged loans, as the three-month LIBOR has recently risen just
above the typical floor of 1 percent.
In addition, yields in the corporate bond market have moved down considerably
since December 2015, despite the increase in yields on comparable-maturity Treasury
bonds, on the basis of lower expected default rates and improved investor sentiment.
Corporate bond issuance has been robust throughout the period.
In household credit markets, financing conditions for residential mortgages have
tightened a bit. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgage loans rose
about 20 basis points, on net, from December 2015 up until the December 2016 FOMC s
n
o
meeting. Perhaps more indicative of the effects of less accommodative monetary policy, ti
di
rates moved up 16 basis points shortly after the December 2016 FOMC announcement, in n

Summary of Economic Projections. Since then, though, some of this increase has
retraced. Home purchase activity has continued apace in this period.
Finally, recent survey data indicate that consumers may be beginning to take
rising interest rates into consideration in their financial decisionmaking, especially
following the December 2016 rate hike. The percentage of consumers expecting higher
interest rates in the next 12 months, based on the University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers, has increased since last summer, although it is not clear how much of this
increase is due to monetary policy actions that have already taken place. The percentage
of consumers that cite expectations of rising interest rates as a reason that it is a good
time to buy a home has increased, and such expectations may be pulling forward some
demand for mortgage credit. In addition, the percentages of consumers who cite low
interest rates as a reason for purchasing homes, automobiles, and durable goods have
declined in recent months.

Risks and Uncertainty t

ai
t
r
e
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n c
U
&
The evidence regarding the magnitude of uncertainty around our projections for s
k
s
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate is mixed. As in the January Tealbook, we Ri
see uncertainty as being somewhat higher than it was before the recent U.S. elections but
nonetheless reasonably well in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). On the one hand, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis index of
economic policy uncertainty remains at a higher level than in the months before the
election. On the other hand, options-based indexes of expected stock market volatility
(for example, the VIX) remain at subdued levels, as do corporate bond spreads.
We continue to regard the risks to our medium-term GDP projection as tilted to
the downside, primarily because monetary policy is likely better positioned to offset large
positive shocks than substantial adverse ones. A rising federal funds rate implies
increasing room for conventional monetary policy actions, but in the staff’s baseline
outlook there is not much room for accommodation in the event of a moderately large
adverse shock over the next year or so. Although we continue to view the risks as tilted
to the downside, we view those risks as less pronounced than in the recent past, reflecting
both risks to the foreign outlook that have subsided somewhat and elevated levels of
consumer and business confidence in the United States. We view the risks around our
unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as skewed to
the upside.
With regard to inflation, we do not view the current level of uncertainty as
unusually high. We see important risks to inflation on both the downside and the upside,
and we view those risks as roughly balanced. To the downside, some survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at low levels. In addition, the
projected divergence between domestic and foreign monetary policies could generate
greater appreciation of the dollar than we have anticipated in the baseline forecast. To
the upside, with the economy projected to be operating above its long-run potential,
inflation may increase more than the staff expects, consistent with the predictions of
models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation, a possibility that
is explored in one of the alternative scenarios.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
y
t
n
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the ai
t
r
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario explores the e
c
n
consequences of a stronger response of wages to labor market slack and a more U
&
pronounced reaction of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation. The second s
k
s
scenario considers the possibility of greater impetus to private demand. The third Ri
scenario illustrates the macroeconomic implications of a disruption in financial markets
due to a reassessment of appropriate asset valuations. In the fourth scenario, we assume
the tax cut incorporated in the staff projection for next year does not materialize. In the
fifth scenario, we analyze the effects of a heightened risk of a breakup of the European
Union that has financial ramifications for the global economy. The sixth scenario
considers the possibility that growth abroad is stronger and that the dollar is weaker than
in the baseline.
We simulate these scenarios using a variety of staff models indicated in the
scenario headings.1 In all but one scenario, the federal funds rate is governed by the same
rule as in the baseline. The exception is the No Fiscal Expansion scenario, where we
assume an alternative adjustment to the intercept in the baseline rule. The size and
composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the
scenarios.
Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and More Sensitive Long-Run Inflation
Expectations (FRB/US)
Despite tight labor and product markets in the Tealbook baseline, core PCE
inflation is projected to pick up only slowly over the medium term, reaching 2 percent in
2019. This outlook is consistent with the relatively muted sensitivity of inflation to
economic slack seen in recent years. However, given the possibility of nonlinearities in
the Phillips curve, this scenario postulates that wages become more sensitive to labor
market slack as the unemployment rate falls further. At the same time, long-run inflation
expectations are assumed to become more sensitive to realized inflation.2
1 The models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; EDO, which is an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy;
and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.
2 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the

Under these circumstances, inflation increases to 2½ percent in 2019 and is close

to 3 percent at the end of the simulation. To counteract the higher inflation, the federal t

s
Ri
Stronger Aggregate Demand (EDO)
Several survey-based indicators of consumer sentiment and business activity have
increased significantly in recent months. Motivated by this survey evidence, this scenario
assumes that more ebullient animal spirits spur faster consumer and business spending.3
In this scenario, real GDP rises 2¾ percent in 2017, compared with 2 percent in
the baseline projection. The unemployment rate falls noticeably faster than baseline in
2017 and 2018; it then edges up over the remainder of the simulation period and is close
to the baseline level by the end of 2020. Inflation is little changed, while the federal
funds rate rises more steeply and is as much as ½ percentage point higher than the
baseline.
Domestic Financial Turbulence (FRB/US)
In the latest QS report, the staff raised its level of concern about asset valuations
to a “notable” level and continued to point to the elevated levels of corporate leverage as
a potential source of fragility. The staff modal outlook assumes that financial
developments proceed smoothly, with equity prices edging up further from current levels
and corporate bond premiums remaining near their recent relatively low levels.
However, risks attend our forecast, and in this scenario, we illustrate the effects of
financial turbulence stemming from a downward adjustment of financial asset and
commercial real estate valuations starting at the end of 2017. We assume that the
financial turmoil leads to higher risk premiums and causes a curtailment of credit to
current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of the increase reflects a comparison between
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.
3 In this scenario, we apply a shock that lowers the aggregate risk premium, which is the model’s
main driver of aggregate demand, by one standard deviation.

Ri
2018, ¾ percentage point higher than in the baseline. The higher unemployment rate and
slightly lower projected inflation imply a shallower path for the federal funds rate, which
is 1¼ percentage points below the baseline projection at the end of 2019.
No Fiscal Expansion (FRB/US)
In the baseline projection, the staff is assuming a cut in personal income taxes
equal to 1 percent of GDP starting in the first quarter of 2018. However, enactment of
fiscal expansion is not assured, and in this scenario, we assume that the tax cut forecast
by the staff does not materialize. As a consequence, we also unwind the adjustments to
the rule for setting the federal funds rate and to the long-term interest rate term premium
made in the baseline projection to account for additional fiscal expansion.
Without the tax cut, real GDP growth is ¼ percentage point lower than in the
baseline in 2018 and slightly lower in 2019, while the unemployment rate is ¼ percentage
point higher at the end of 2018. In addition, inflation follows a slightly lower trajectory
in this scenario. These developments, together with the adjustment to the rule for setting
the federal funds rate, result in a federal funds rate that is ½ percentage point below the
baseline at the end of 2020.
Heightened Risk of EU Breakup (SIGMA)
As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook box
“Political Uncertainty and the Economic Outlook for the Euro Area,” increasing support
for anti-EU parties poses significant economic and political risks. In our baseline, anti-
EU sentiment—notwithstanding probable flare-ups—remains sufficiently contained, and
as a result financial conditions remain stable and EU output expands at a moderate
pace. This scenario considers the possibility that the European elections bring anti-EU
4 To calibrate this scenario, we assume an increase in the Gilchrist-Zakrajšek excess bond
premium that is about half the increase seen in this indicator around the time of the Lehman Brothers
collapse. We then infer the effect of an increase in the excess bond premium on FRB/US spending
equation residuals—and on the model’s bond and equity risk premium residuals—through linear
regressions.

U
&
Specifically, our scenario assumes that EU GDP falls about 4 percent below the s
k
s
baseline by the end of 2018 as EU corporate borrowing spreads widen markedly—about
Ri
100 basis points by the end of this year—and household and business confidence
declines. The EU crisis has sizable adverse spillovers to the United States: Investment-
grade corporate bond spreads rise about 50 basis points, flight-to-safety flows boost the
trade-weighted dollar 10 percent above its baseline path, and the term premium on long-
term U.S. Treasuries declines. Financial conditions also tighten markedly in economies
outside the EU and United States.5
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall
relative to the baseline, while lower confidence and weaker financial conditions in the
United States depress domestic demand. All told, U.S. real GDP expands only
1¼ percent per year, on average, in 2017 and in 2018, about ¾ percentage point less than
in the baseline. The U.S. unemployment rate is about ¾ percentage point higher than in
the baseline in late 2018 and remains above the baseline through 2022. Lower resource
utilization and falling import prices reduce U.S. core PCE inflation to about 1¼ percent
by 2018. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path, reaching only 1½ percent at the
end of 2018.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar (SIGMA)
In our baseline forecast, we expect that the foreign economies will expand at a
moderate pace and that underlying inflation will edge up gradually to central bank
targets. However, some foreign industrial production and trade indicators have come in
somewhat stronger than expected in recent months, and the expansion abroad may prove
faster, especially if highly accommodative monetary policies in the AFEs boost aggregate
demand more than assumed in the baseline. In this scenario, we assume that foreign
GDP growth rises to about 3½ percent in 2017 and 2018, about 1 percentage point per
year higher than under our baseline projection. Increased optimism about the foreign

tightening observed during the 2011–12 European debt crisis, except for the 10 percent appreciation of the
dollar, which is somewhat larger.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c
n
U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
t
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds
rate and compare the associated policy paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those in
the Tealbook baseline. The prescriptions of simple rules and optimal control exercises
are little changed from the January Tealbook, reflecting small and offsetting effects of an
upward revision to near-term inflation and a delayed start in the assumed fiscal expansion
from the third quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. Most simple rules and optimal
control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than assumed in
the staff forecast. In a special exhibit, we examine optimal control policy prescriptions
when the underlying baseline projection is consistent with the median responses to the
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) rather than the staff forecast.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first-difference rule.1 These prescriptions
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output gap and inflation in the near
term, shown in the middle panels. The top and middle panels also include the staff’s
baseline assumption for the path of the federal funds rate.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor-type policy rules in the second quarter of 2017
are slightly above their counterparts in the January Tealbook, reflecting an
upward revision to the staff’s projection of core PCE inflation in 2017. Their
prescriptions in the following quarter are little changed from the January
Tealbook, reflecting offsetting effects of the upward revision to near-term
inflation and of the downward revision in the output gap.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not feature an interest
rate smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the
near term than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline.
1 We provide details on each of these four simple rules in the appendix to this section.

report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period

as the Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r*.

• The near-term prescriptions of the first-difference rule are little changed from
the January Tealbook.
A MEDIUM-TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model, given
the staff’s baseline projection. This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
• The current-quarter estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is
0.1 percentage point lower than in the January Tealbook, reflecting a small
downward revision to the output gap.
• At 1.42 percent, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is more than 1 percentage
point above the average projected real federal funds rate in the staff forecast
for the same 12-quarter period and 42 basis points above the staff’s estimate
of the real federal funds rate in the long run.
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is
below Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction function
assumed by the staff encompasses several policy considerations in addition to
closing the output gap, such as ensuring that inflation stays near the
Committee’s 2 percent objective.
SIMPLE POLICY RULES SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model under the
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
and the first-difference rule.2 These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the
output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows the paths implied by the
2 Unless otherwise noted, the policy rules assume that policymakers are committed to following
the prescriptions of each rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage
setters believe that policymakers will follow through with this commitment and understand its
macroeconomic implications.

different policy rules.3 The policy paths prescribed by each rule are little changed from
the January Tealbook, reflecting offsetting effects of the upward revision to near-term
inflation and of the downward revision in the output gap.
• The policy path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the
intercept. The federal funds rate increases, on average, about 95 basis points
per year through the first quarter of 2020, when it reaches 3.5 percent. The
pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at
around 4 percent in 2021 before eventually returning to its longer-run level of
3 percent.
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a constant intercept prescribes a slightly
higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than the version
with a judgmental intercept adjustment used to construct the Tealbook
baseline. The difference in policy rates arising from this alternative intercept
assumption is small and dissipates too rapidly to have marked effects on the
real longer-term interest rates that influence economic activity in the FRB/US
model. Thus, macroeconomic outcomes under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule
are similar to those in the Tealbook baseline.
• The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years. This
initially more rapid tightening of policy is followed by a period extending well
beyond 2022 during which the federal funds rate is lower than in the Tealbook
projection. As a result, the paths for the real 10-year Treasury yield under
these two rules are, on net, not far from that under the Tealbook baseline, and,
therefore, the differences in the paths for unemployment and inflation are
relatively small in relation to the initially large differences in the path of the
federal funds rate.4
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.
4 The Taylor (1993) rule calls for slightly lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over the
period shown because it does not respond as strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level
over the next several years. As a consequence, the Taylor (1993) rule generates a lower trajectory for the
unemployment rate and a slightly higher trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor (1999) rule.

• The first-difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline. Thereafter, the federal funds
rate eventually drifts down to near its longer-run level of 3 percent. By
contrast, the federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline continues to rise for a
while after 2019. This divergence occurs because the first-difference rule,
which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its
level, reacts to the projected narrowing of the output gap late in the decade
and beyond. The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2019, in
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflation in the future,
implies lower longer-term real rates over the entire projection period relative

M
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy
choices in a way that improves current and future economic outcomes.6 As was the case
for the simple rules, the federal funds rate paths prescribed by optimal control under each
of the four loss functions are little changed from the January Tealbook.
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on changes in the federal funds rate. Under this strategy,
the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook
5
The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix provides technical
details on the optimal control simulations.
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ actions; however, the simulations are not
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

baseline policy path. This higher path arises because, in the current baseline
projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that the “equal weights”
loss function judges to be costly. A tighter policy results in a path of the
unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook
baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of
inflation to lower levels of resource utilization in the FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate
is considerably below both the path for the case of equal weights and the
Tealbook baseline path. With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers
choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate because their
desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this
outcome. The tighter labor market causes inflation to reach 2 percent more
quickly than in the case of equal weights; inflation then edges above the
Committee’s longer-run objective for the next decade.7
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function
that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times
larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise identical.
The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in
the “equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with
undershooting the inflation objective in coming years are larger. The reason
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff
7 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation objective and undershooting of the
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to reoptimize the path of the federal funds rate
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, policy rates and
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook baseline and optimal control under
commitment. For the other three specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under
commitment and discretion are not much different from each other.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

because inflation responds little to resource utilization. Hence, policymakers
would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of
unemployment, which this specification of the loss function sees as costly, in
order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but
is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the resulting
optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the specification
with equal weights in 2017 in an effort to contain the projected undershooting
of the natural rate of unemployment, and remains around 5 percent over the
remainder of the period shown. The paths for the real federal funds rate and
the real 10-year Treasury yield are also noticeably higher for a couple of years
than in the case of equal weights. While this policy leaves the trajectory for
inflation almost unaffected, it keeps the unemployment rate close to the staff’s
estimate of the natural rate.
OPTIMAL CONTROL USING A PROJECTION CONSISTENT WITH THE SEP
In the optimal control simulations presented so far, the optimal path of the federal
funds rate is substantially above the Tealbook baseline policy path except when the
assumed loss function does not place any weight on undershooting the natural rate of
unemployment. Here, we illustrate how these results depend on the assumed baseline
outlook. To this end, we discuss the policy prescriptions of optimal control under the
loss function with equal weights when applied to a baseline projection that is consistent
with the median responses in the December 2016 SEP rather than the current Tealbook
projection. As before, the simulations are carried out using the FRB/US model, so that
the marginal effects of changes in the federal funds rate are nearly identical under the
SEP-consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline.8
• The SEP-consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline differ in several ways.
8 To construct an SEP-consistent baseline for the FRB/US model, the staff interpolated annual
SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2019 (the last year reported in the
December 2016 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth and monotonic way.
The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP; for example, the
staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of the unemployment
rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

Note: The SEP−consistent projection is constructed to match the median responses to the December 2016 Summary of
Economic Projections; for details, see footnote 8 in the main text. It is assumed that the natural rate of unemployment is
given by the median longer−run unemployment rate projection of 4.8 percent. In the Tealbook baseline, the natural rate of
unemployment is 5 percent. All simulations are performed in the FRB/US model.

In the SEP-consistent baseline, the projected path for the unemployment
o
rate is higher than in the March Tealbook. Moreover, the natural rate of
unemployment is assumed to be 4.8 percent, in line with the median
longer-run SEP projection. By contrast, the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate of unemployment is 5 percent. As a result, the
unemployment gap, shown in the upper-right panel, is considerably less
negative over the entire projection period in the SEP-consistent baseline
than in the Tealbook baseline.9
At the same time, the path for the federal funds rate is lower in the SEP-
o
consistent baseline than in the Tealbook baseline. In the model, this
lower policy path implies that the less-negative unemployment gap is
not a result of tighter policy, but of a lower neutral rate of interest
implicit in the SEP median projection than in the staff projection.10
The path for the rate of inflation in the SEP-consistent baseline is higher
o
and stays closer to the Committee’s 2 percent goal than in the Tealbook
baseline. SEP median inflation reaches 2 percent in 2018, and the
inflation gap remains minimal thereafter.
• The lines labeled “Equal weights (SEP-consistent)” report optimal control
simulation results under the loss function with equal weights and using the
SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection. The prescribed path for
the federal funds rate is higher than the SEP-consistent baseline policy path by
0.4 percentage point, on average, through 2022.11 This higher path arises
because, in the SEP median projection, the unemployment rate falls below its
longer-run value over the next several years, an outcome that is judged to be
costly in the model under the equal weights loss function.
9 Because of the lower assumed natural rate of unemployment in the SEP baseline, the
unemployment gap is higher than in the Tealbook baseline both going forward and in the recent past.
10 The neutral rate of interest is the interest rate that is consistent with output growing at its
potential pace, provided that output is initially at its potential level.
11 This difference does not imply that the median SEP path is necessarily suboptimal. In providing
their projections, respondents to the SEP may factor in elements that are not captured by the simple loss
function that we assume. Moreover, the assumptions about the economic relationships in the model, as
well as the projections beyond the variables and periods contained in the SEP release, need not coincide
with the projection and perceived economic tradeoffs of SEP respondents. Indeed, the median SEP likely
does not correspond to the projection of any particular respondent or of the Committee.

• That said, the deviation of the optimal control path of the federal funds rate
from the policy path in the SEP-consistent baseline is considerably smaller
than the corresponding deviation under the Tealbook baseline; in the latter
case, the difference averages 1.3 percentage points through 2022. The fact
that both the inflation gap and the unemployment gap are small in the SEP-
consistent baseline implies that the baseline policy path is already close to
optimal for the equal weights loss function, which is not the case under the
Tealbook baseline.
• The optimal control path for the nominal federal funds rate through 2022 is
s
e 1.5 percentage points lower, on average, under the SEP-consistent baseline

n unemployment gap through 2022 is 0.1 percentage point higher, on average,
o
M than its baseline path. Under the Tealbook baseline, this difference is
substantially larger, averaging 0.5 percentage point over the projection period,
because policymakers under optimal control must trade off the larger
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment with their desire to return
inflation back to 2 percent.
• The optimal control path for inflation under the SEP-consistent baseline is
closer to 2 percent than the optimal control path under the Tealbook baseline.
Whereas the optimal control and the baseline inflation paths are similar under
the SEP-consistent baseline, the optimal control inflation path under the
Tealbook baseline is appreciably lower than the baseline projection because
policymakers aim to contain the undershooting of the natural rate of
unemployment.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic
implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together, possibly along with others, as a means to assess the various tradeoffs
policymakers may face when pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES”
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported
in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t.
The right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( and ), the output gap estimate
for the current period (ygap), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the
t 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3|𝑡𝑡
output gap (∆4ygap ). The value of policymakers’ longer-run inflation objective, denoted πLR,
t+3|t
is 2 percent.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board
s staff.1 The intercepts of these rules, denoted , are constant and chosen so that they are

e
n quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters. When the Tealbook is
o
M
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters. Rules that
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. To isolate the effects of
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate. The “Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model
of the U.S. economy.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012).
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.
3 For a discussion of this and other concepts of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and
others (2016).

which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. It is generated after
the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they match those in
the extended Tealbook forecast. A model simulation then determines the value of the real federal
funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the staff’s
extended baseline forecast.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and
the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close
the output gap at the end of this time frame, whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal
funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters have perfect foresight and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealbook
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large-scale asset
purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin
in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( ,
measured a𝑃𝑃s 𝑃𝑃t𝑃𝑃he difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡
rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate. In the following equation, the resulting loss
function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount
factor :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the

Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect
foresight and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy
decisions made prior to the simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a
horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon further would not
affect the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits.
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.
