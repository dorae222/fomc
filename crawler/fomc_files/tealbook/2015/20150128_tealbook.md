Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information we have received since the December Tealbook suggests that D
n
economic activity expanded at a strong pace over the second half of last year. Folding in o
c
E
the upward revision to GDP growth in the third quarter and the incoming spending data
c
i
t
for the fourth, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an average annual rate of s
e
m
3¾ percent over those two quarters, ¾ percentage point above the December Tealbook o
D
forecast and well above our estimate of potential output growth. Real private domestic
final purchases (PDFP), which we judge to be a better indicator of the underlying
momentum in the economy, appear to have increased at about the same pace as real GDP.
Meanwhile, labor market conditions improved a little more than we had anticipated.
Taken together, the positive surprises in labor and product markets suggest that the
economy entered 2015 with a little less resource slack than we had previously projected.
In light of the greater momentum suggested by the recent data and the significant
boost to household purchasing power implied by the latest declines in oil prices, we have
also marked up our projection for economic activity in the first half of this year.
Although real GDP growth is expected to slow to an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the first
half, real PDFP is now expected to increase at a robust annual rate of 4 percent; both
figures are higher than in the December Tealbook. Similarly, we have upgraded our
near-term outlook somewhat for the pace of job gains and slightly lowered the projected
near-term path for the unemployment rate.
As in previous forecasts, we anticipate that accommodative monetary policy will
continue to help support a pace of real GDP growth over the next three years that exceeds
the growth rate of potential output. Although we judge the level of GDP to be currently
½ percent higher than in the December Tealbook, our forecast of GDP growth over the
next three years is little revised, as the carry-on effects of the positive near-term spending
surprises and the support to household spending from lower energy prices are offset by
the restraint implied by the recent appreciation of the dollar. (See the box “Reviewing
the Effects of Changes in the Dollar and Oil Prices on U.S. GDP.”1) We now project that
1 During the intermeeting period, we decided to build into the judgmental projection a somewhat
greater boost to real activity from the further decline in oil prices in order to bring these effects closer to the
center of the range of estimates from various staff models and other empirical estimates in the research
literature.

Reviewing the Effects of Changes in the Dollar and Oil Prices on U.S. GDP
&
l
e Since the middle of 2014, oil prices have declined dramatically and the dollar has appreciated
v
e sharply. In this discussion, we review the estimated effects of the higher dollar and lower oil
D
prices on U.S. GDP. Both the appreciation of the dollar and the fall in oil prices have had large
n
o effects on our outlook, with, on net, the negative effect of the higher dollar outweighing the
c
E positive effect of lower oil prices.
c
i
s t Table 1 reviews the rules of thumb in the staff judgmental forecast for a 10 percent appreciation
e
m of the dollar and a 10 percent decline in the price of oil.1 The table reports the estimated direct
o
effects of these changes, abstracting from the response of monetary policy and other financial
D
variables. Dollar appreciation lowers exports and increases imports, both of which contribute to
a large negative effect on the level of GDP that increases with time. In contrast, lower oil prices
boost the level of GDP, as the positive impetus to consumption more than offsets the negative
effect on net exports and investment in the oil industry.2 The positive effect of an oil price
decline largely occurs within a year.
Since the July Tealbook, the broad real dollar has appreciated about 10 percent, lowering the
level of the staff forecast for U.S. GDP by 1.6 percent by the end of 2017 (as shown in table 2).
Over the same period, the spot price of Brent crude oil has declined almost 60 percent, while
prices for further-dated futures contracts have fallen about 35 percent. Judging movements in
prices that are further out on the futures curve to be more indicative of persistent price changes,
the staff estimates that the 35 percent fall in futures prices will boost the level of GDP by about
¾ percent, with most of the increase occurring by the end of this year (also shown in table 2).
Thus, on net, the two effects roughly offset one another in 2014 and 2015, but thereafter the
negative dollar effect grows to be the larger influence.
The effects reported above are not the only considerations linking changes in the dollar and oil
prices to changes in the overall staff outlook. For instance, the estimates do not include the
response of monetary policy, which buffers the effects coming through either channel. In
addition, the estimated effects do not take into account the underlying factors that might be
driving the higher dollar and lower oil prices, which could show up elsewhere in the staff forecast
with implications for GDP. Of course, considerable uncertainty also attends these estimates, both
for the effects of movements in the dollar and in oil prices.
1 These rules of thumb are inclusive of recent changes in the staff’s methodology, including changes adopted
in the December Tealbook that lessened the sensitivity of U.S. GDP to exchange rate movements and changes
adopted in the January Tealbook that increased the responsiveness of U.S. GDP to oil prices.
2 For a fuller discussion of the effects of lower oil prices on the U.S. economy and the risks surrounding our
estimates, see the January 21, 2015, memorandum to the FOMC, “The Effects of Lower Oil Prices on U.S. Activity:
Baseline Assumptions and Risks,” by Kimberly Bayard, David Byrne, Gustavo Suarez, and Robert Vigfusson.

real GDP will expand about 2¾ percent per year in both 2015 and 2016. Although the u t
O
continued normalization of monetary policy is expected to lead to an easing in economic
&
growth in 2017, the level of real GDP is nonetheless expected to be around 1 percent e l
v
e
above its potential at the end of that year, a little higher than in our previous projection. D
n
o
c
An undershooting of the unemployment rate, relative to our estimate of a E
c
i
5.2 percent natural rate, remains a feature of the labor market projection. In particular, t
s
e
m
we expect the unemployment rate to drift down steadily, from 5.6 percent last month to
o
D
4.8 percent in the final quarter of 2017. Both of these figures are 0.1 percentage point
below the December Tealbook projection. Even so, the decline in the unemployment rate
continues to be more gradual than one would infer from the change in the GDP gap,
reflecting an unwinding of the current unusual weakness in the labor force participation
rate.
The further sharp declines in crude oil prices have had a substantial effect on the
near-term forecast for PCE price inflation. We now project that headline PCE prices
decreased last quarter and will show an even larger decline this quarter. We have also
marked down our near-term outlook for core PCE inflation in response to surprising
softness in the incoming price data for November and December. Nevertheless, we still
expect core PCE price inflation to step up gradually to 1¾ percent over the medium term,
as the extended period of falling import prices comes to an end and resource utilization
tightens further. With an upward tilt in the forecast for energy prices beyond the near
term, total PCE inflation follows a slightly higher trajectory than core inflation over the
medium-term projection.
As always, numerous risks attend our outlook. We view the uncertainty around
our projection for real GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate as roughly in
line with the average of the past 20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility.
We have maintained our assessment that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted
somewhat to the downside, largely reflecting our view that neither monetary policy nor
fiscal policy appears well positioned to offset substantial adverse shocks to the economy.
We also still see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly
balanced, as the downside risks to real activity are about offset by the possibility that the
unemployment rate could continue to decline more rapidly than we expect. Our
downside concerns with respect to inflation have intensified somewhat given the recent

COMPARING THE STAFF PROJECTION WITH OTHER FORECASTS D e
n
o
The staff forecasts of real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 are essentially the same c
E
as the January Blue Chip consensus outlook. Meanwhile, the staff’s forecasts of the c
i
t
s
e
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year and next are a bit lower than the m
o
Blue Chip Consensus. The staff’s projection for consumer price inflation in 2015 stands D
about 1 percentage point below the consensus of the Blue Chip panelists, but, given the
recent declines in energy prices, this divergence likely reflects the difference in the
timing of the Blue Chip survey and the close of the January Tealbook; the two forecasts
are similar in 2016.2

same participants as the Blue Chip survey) were released in November, so they predate the encouraging
employment reports for November and December, strong recent spending data, and much of the recent
decline in oil prices.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS u t
O
&
Monetary Policy
l
e
v
 We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its e
D
effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015. However, taking note of n
o
c
the Committee’s statement in December that it “can be patient in beginning to E
c
i
normalize the stance of monetary policy,” we now assume more specifically s t
e
m
that liftoff does not occur until the June meeting. Following liftoff, the federal
o
D
funds rate rises at a pace prescribed by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999)
policy rule. In the near term, the slight delay of liftoff leaves the projected
federal funds rate a little lower than in the previous forecast; by the fourth
quarter of 2017, however, the federal funds rate is 18 basis points higher than
in the December Tealbook, primarily reflecting the positive revision to the
output gap in the medium-term projection.
Other Interest Rates
 The projected trajectory for the 10-year Treasury yield is notably lower in the
near term compared with the December Tealbook projection, consistent with
the substantial recent declines in market rates. Further out in the forecast
period, the path of the 10-year Treasury yield was revised up somewhat to
better align it with the predictions of our model. Our medium-term projection
continues to call for Treasury yields to rise significantly, primarily because of
the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of
extremely low short-term interest rates as well as an increase in term
premiums. The rise in term premiums, in turn, is partly due to a gradual
waning of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.
 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium
term have been revised essentially in line with the revisions to the path for the
Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 The projected path for equity prices over the medium term is essentially
unrevised relative to the December Tealbook.

k
o
o
l
u
t
 Incoming house price data for October and November were close to our
O
& December Tealbook forecast, and we continue to project that house price
l
e appreciation will slow from roughly 5 percent in 2014 to an average rate of
v
e
D about 3 percent per year from 2015 to 2017.
n
o
c
E Fiscal Policy
c
i
t
s  We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.
e
m
o We continue to anticipate that the small drag on real GDP growth from fiscal
D
policy actions across all levels of government in 2014 will swing to a small
stimulus from 2015 through 2017.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 The pace of foreign economic activity appears to have stepped up slightly in
the second half of last year, to a still-subdued annual rate of 2½ percent. We
expect that economic growth abroad will step up to an annual rate of 3 percent
over the medium term, supported in part by lower oil prices, more
accommodative monetary policy, and depreciation of foreign currencies
against the dollar. Nevertheless, the downside risks to the foreign outlook still
appear elevated.
 The broad nominal index for the dollar has appreciated about 2¼ percent since
the previous Tealbook, likely reflecting, in part, the continued divergence
between the expected paths of monetary policy across countries and the
perception of increased risks to economic growth abroad. Looking ahead, we
expect the nominal dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of 1 percent this year
and then to flatten out over the remainder of the forecast period, as further
appreciation against other major currencies is offset by depreciation against
the currencies of the emerging market economies. The slope of the medium-
term path of the dollar is somewhat flatter in this projection, as we now expect
Chinese authorities to put further renminbi appreciation on hold through 2015.
All told, the broad real dollar is about 3 percent higher by the end of 2017
than in the previous Tealbook.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil declined an additional $19 per barrel since
the time of the December Tealbook, reaching $48 per barrel on January 20.

k
o
o
l
This decline likely reflected increased concerns about global demand and the u t
O
persistent strength of global production. Prices for futures contracts with
&
delivery at the end of 2017 also fell noticeably, but by less than the drop in the e l
v
e
spot price, which increased the upward tilt in the futures curve. We view the D
n
projected increase in prices as reflecting expectations of a pickup in global o
c
E
demand accompanied by a slowing in supply growth, as producers respond
c
i
t
gradually to the lower path for prices. We expect the price of imported oil to s
e
m
move up from $49 per barrel this quarter to about $61 per barrel by the end of o
D
the forecast period. Relative to the December Tealbook, our forecast is
$15 per barrel lower this year and $9 per barrel lower at the end of 2017.
 For most of 2014, metals prices remained relatively flat even though oil prices
plunged and the dollar appreciated. Since the December Tealbook, however,
metals prices have fallen 8 percent, likely indicating heightened concerns
about the prospects for global demand, primarily from China.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The incoming spending data have led us to revise up our estimate of real GDP
growth during the second half of last year, to an annual rate of 3¾ percent, substantially
above the weak growth rate recorded over the first half of the year and ¾ percentage
point above the December Tealbook projection. We expect real GDP growth to slow to a
rate of 2¾ percent in the first half of this year, pulled down by both net exports and
inventory investment.
 For the most part, we have interpreted the stronger-than-expected increase in
aggregate output last year as indicating that resource utilization around the
turn of the year was tighter than we had previously thought, an assessment
that is corroborated by labor market indicators.
 Upward revisions to the third-quarter estimate of real PCE, coupled with
stronger incoming data, on balance, for the fourth quarter, pushed up our
estimate of PCE growth in the second half of last year to an annual rate of
3½ percent, ¾ percentage point faster than in the December Tealbook. We
took some signal from the higher trajectory, as well as the further decline in
oil prices and a notable improvement in consumer sentiment, and revised up
PCE growth to a robust annual rate of 4¼ percent in the first half of this year.

o
c
E  After rising at a solid pace through much of last year, growth in private
c
t i business fixed investment slowed in the fourth quarter and is expected to
s
e
m
weaken further in the first half of this year, as declines in outlays for drilling
o
D
structures caused by the large drop in crude oil prices largely offset moderate
increases in other capital expenditures.
 Weighed down by the drag from previous dollar appreciation, net exports are
expected to subtract ½ percentage point from real GDP growth in the first half
of this year after exerting a roughly neutral influence on output growth in the
second half of last year.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We continue to anticipate that real GDP growth will exceed its potential rate of
1¾ percent throughout the medium term. Specifically, real GDP is projected to increase
2¾ percent in both 2015 and 2016 and then slow to about 2 percent in 2017, as economic
growth eases with the ongoing normalization of monetary policy.
 Although the projected level of GDP this quarter is ½ percent higher than in
the December Tealbook, our forecast of GDP growth over the medium term is
little revised. The greater momentum from the positive spending surprises
and the support to household spending from lower energy prices are about
offset by the restraint implied by the recent appreciation of the dollar.
 The only change we made to our supply-side assumptions was to slightly raise
our estimate of potential output growth in 2014. This revision unwound a
little more of the downward adjustment we made in the July Tealbook to
insulate our estimates of the output gap against what we judge to be statistical
noise in the spending data from the first quarter of last year.
 Even with a higher level of potential output, the sizable upward revisions to
the projection for actual GDP since the December Tealbook imply that the
output gap at the start of this year is somewhat narrower than in the previous

projection. We now expect that GDP will be 1 percent above its potential u t

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET n
o
c
E
The December employment report and other incoming indicators showed c
i
t
s
somewhat more improvement in labor market conditions than we had expected. e
m
o
D
 Although the December gain in nonfarm payrolls was in line with our
expectations, upward revisions to the October and November figures pushed
up the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter to 290,000. In response, we
nudged up our forecast for first-quarter payroll gains by 15,000 per month, to
230,000.
 The unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in December, down 0.2 percentage
point from November and 0.5 percentage point lower than six months earlier.
In the first quarter, we expect the unemployment rate to average 5.4 percent,
0.1 percentage point below our previous forecast.
 The labor force participation rate edged down to 62.7 percent in December, a
touch lower than our projection in the previous Tealbook but little changed,
on net, over the past several quarters.
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, which summarizes the movements
in 19 labor market indicators, improved noticeably in December and over the
fourth quarter as a whole.
Since the December Tealbook, we have also upgraded our medium-term outlook
for the labor market, largely reflecting the more positive outlook for the GDP gap in this
projection.
3 As was noted in the December Tealbook, we intend our estimate of the output gap to provide a
more comprehensive gauge of overall resource slack over the projection period than the unemployment rate
gap because the former measure also includes the unusual degree of cyclical weakness that we estimate in
labor force participation. We project that the so-called Okun’s law error will persist over the next several
quarters before tapering off over the medium term, eventually bringing the different measures of resource
slack into alignment.

 We expect monthly job gains to average about 230,000 this year and next year
O
& before slowing to around 150,000 in 2017. These gains are little changed
l
e from what we had projected in December.
v
e
D
n  We project that the unemployment rate will edge down gradually to
o
c
E 4.8 percent by the end of 2017. The unemployment rate is projected to move
c
t i below our estimate of 5.2 percent for the natural rate later this year and is
s
e
m
anticipated to be nearly ½ percentage point below the natural rate at the end of
o
D
the projection period.
 At present, we believe that the unemployment rate gap understates the amount
of slack remaining in the labor market, reflecting an unusually weak recovery
in the labor force participation rate and, we think, an unusually elevated level
of involuntary part-time employment. As the economy improves, we expect
that wage gains will pick up and that more of the individuals currently not in
the labor force will be drawn in. This effect will accelerate the cyclical
recovery in the participation rate while attenuating the decline in the
unemployment rate. As a result, we expect that the unemployment rate will
only edge down during 2016 and 2017 even as GDP continues to increase
faster than its potential.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The further sharp declines in crude oil prices have resulted in a substantially
lower near-term projection for headline PCE price inflation. We now estimate that total
PCE prices decreased at an annual rate of ½ percent last quarter, and we anticipate a
further decline of 2½ percent this quarter. In addition, the incoming data on core prices
have been softer than we had expected. Nevertheless, we still expect core PCE inflation
to reach 1.8 percent by the end of the medium term, as import prices turn up and resource
utilization tightens. With consumer energy prices projected to rise faster than core prices
beginning later this year, total PCE inflation follows a slightly higher trajectory than core
inflation in 2016 and 2017. (Also see the box “Alternative View: A Different
Framework for Inflation.”)
 After folding in negative surprises for November and December, we now
estimate that core PCE inflation was about 1 percent last quarter and expect it
to be the same this quarter. Prices for goods other than food and energy,

k
o
o
l
which are heavily influenced by core import prices, have been especially soft. u t
O
In light of the ongoing dollar appreciation and further projected declines in
&
import prices in the near term, we carried forward some of the negative e l
v
e
surprises and lowered our forecast for core inflation over the first half of this D
n
year. o
c
E
c
 With crude oil prices continuing to decline, we marked down the near-term t i
s
e
projection for consumer energy prices considerably and now expect these m
o
D
prices to fall at an annual rate of more than 50 percent in the first quarter. Our
projection assumes that the pass-through from crude to retail gasoline prices
will be essentially completed by midyear, and we therefore expect that
consumer energy prices will turn up in the second half and rise somewhat
faster than core prices in the medium term, consistent with the moderate
upward tilt in the futures path for crude oil prices.
 Consumer food price inflation slowed in the fourth quarter from the elevated
rates observed in the middle of last year. Given the substantial declines in
farm commodity prices observed in recent months, consumer food price
inflation is expected to be soft in the next few quarters. In the medium term,
we project that consumer food prices will rise at a pace roughly in line with
core inflation.
 Core import prices are expected to decline at an average annual rate of nearly
3 percent in the first half of this year, reflecting the appreciation of the dollar
and declines in commodity prices. As the dollar flattens out and foreign CPI
inflation picks up, core import price inflation is expected to turn positive by
the second half of the year and to move up to a 1¼ percent pace in 2016 and
2017.
 Survey-based measures of long-run inflation expectations have remained
within the narrow range of values seen in recent years. By contrast, TIPS-
based measures of inflation compensation have declined further since the time
of the December Tealbook. Staff models continue to attribute little of this
decline in inflation compensation to lower expected inflation. (Also see the
box “An Update on Measures of Longer-Term Inflation Compensation and
Inflation Expectations” in the Financial Developments section.)

Alternative View: A Different Framework for Inflation 1
&
l
e
v Traditional Phillips curves generally suggest that inflation should have continuously declined in
e
D
recent years as low current-period inflation resulting from excess unemployment fed through to
n
o lower expected future inflation, which in turn lowered next period’s inflation in a repeating cycle
c
E (the so-called accelerationist assumption). The staff has relied on anchored inflation
c expectations—t he idea that expected future inflation has been little influenced by observed
i
t
s inflation and instead remained roughly constant over the past 15 years—t o explain the lack of
e
m continuously declining inflation since the onset of the recession.
o
D
An alternative to this assumption of anchored inflation expectations is a nonlinear Phillips curve.
This alternative framework maintains the traditional accelerationist assumption but allows the
tradeoff between inflation and unemployment to diminish as unemployment increases.1
Nonlinearities in the Phillips curve can arise from several factors, including nominal wage rigidities,
which could reduce the ability of firms to cut wages and prices, and an elevated share of long-term
unemployed workers in deep recessions, which might put less downward pressure on inflation
than the usual mix of unemployed workers.2 Depending on the degree of labor market slack,
which is highly uncertain, this alternative nonlinear Phillips curve framework could imply risks
either to the upside or the downside of the staff’s baseline projection for inflation.
Note: This alternative view was prepared by Alan Detmeister.
1 While most empirical Phillips curve models assume a constant tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in
the short run, a nonlinear slope in the Phillips curve has a long history in economics, and many introductory textbooks
draw the Phillips curve nonlinearly.
2 Among the large number of recent works on inflation and unemployment duration, see Daniel Aaronson and
Andrew Jordan (2014), “Understanding the Relationship between Real Wage Growth and Labor Market Conditions,”
Chicago Fed Letter 327 (October), www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2014/october-327.

Examining data such as those shown in figure 1, recent work on nonlinearities in the Phillips curve O
has focused on wage inflation.3 Here, instead, we delve into core PCE price inflation using a Phillips &
curve that closely approximates Robert Gordon’s well-known triangle model.4 As shown in e l
v
figure 2, allowing for nonlinearities in this otherwise traditional model suggests that e
D
unemployment affects inflation considerably less (that is, the slope is much flatter) when the
n
unemployment rate gap is very high compared with when it is very low. As a result, this nonlinear o
c
model explains the relatively small decline in inflation in recent years fairly well without relying on E
c
anchored expectations. i
t
s
e
Since past inflation feeds through into future inflation in this model and the unemployment rate is m
o
projected to be relatively close to the natural rate of unemployment over the next few years, this D
model suggests no increase in core inflation in the medium term—a projection that is notably
below the slowly increasing inflation in the current Tealbook baseline (compare the blue dashed
line with the black line in figure 3). However, the projection from this framework is much more
sensitive to the assumed amount of slack in the unemployment rate gap than the staff’s baseline
view. For example, if in reality there is considerably less slack than in the Tealbook baseline— such
as if the natural rate of unemployment is around 6 percent as suggested by some of the estimates
in a recent Cleveland Fed Economic Commentary— the nonlinear model would project inflation
roughly ½ percentage point higher than the baseline in 2017 (the red dashed line in figure 3), even
though the staff’s usual response in the anchored expectations framework would move the
projection up only about one-tenth of a percentage point (not shown).5
3 For example, see Anil Kumar and Pia Orrenius (2014), “A Closer Look at the Phillips Curve Using State Level Data,”
Working Paper 1409 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, October),
www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2014/wp1409.pdf; and Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig
(2014), “Are We There Yet? Assessing Progress toward Full Employment and Price Stability,” Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas, Economic Letter, vol. 9 (13), pp. 1– 4, www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf.
4 The model predicts quarterly core PCE inflation using 24 lags of core PCE inflation, import prices, the change in
trend productivity growth, the difference between core and total PCE inflation, and a measure of slack. For slack, we
use the staff unemployment rate gap. See Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well: Inflation and
the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper No. 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic
Research, August).
5 The projections, which are fitted values through the end of 2014 and forecast values thereafter, assume a natural
rate of unemployment of 6 percent starting in the first quarter of 2012, when the Tealbook baseline natural rate first falls
below that threshold, and Tealbook baseline forecasts for the unemployment rate; trend productivity; and food, energy,
and import prices. The comparison of natural rate estimates see Murat Tasci and Randal Verbrugge (2014), “How Much
Slack Is in the Labor Market? That Depends on What You Mean by Slack,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary, 2014-21 (October),

 We expect core PCE price inflation to edge up gradually from 1½ percent this
O
& year to 1¾ percent in 2017, as core import prices turn up and resource slack
l
e diminishes in an environment of well-anchored long-run inflation
v
e
D expectations. Although the projection for core inflation last year and for the
n
o first half of this year has been revised down somewhat, it is unchanged over
c
E
the medium term, as the effects of slightly tighter labor and product markets
c
i
t
s about offset the pass-through of lower core import and energy prices.
e
m
o
D
 The only piece of information on wages that we have received since the
previous Tealbook is the December report on average hourly earnings, which
was weaker than expected. Pending corroborating readings from other
compensation measures, we have put little weight on the recent average
hourly earnings figures. With labor and product markets tightening steadily
over the projection, we expect the Productivity and Cost measure of hourly
compensation to accelerate to about 3½ percent, over 2016 and 2017.4
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. The policy rule assumes a long-run
equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3¾ percent.
 The federal funds rate continues to rise after 2017, moving slightly above its
long-run level in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the positive output gap.
 Real GDP growth slows to 1.6 percent in 2018 and 2019—a pace below its
estimated longer-run potential growth rate of 2 percent—reflecting the less
accommodative stance of monetary policy. The unemployment rate gradually
edges up from 4¾ percent in early 2018 toward its natural rate of 5¼ percent.
 With the unemployment rate below the natural rate, longer-run inflation
expectations gradually return to the Committee’s target and PCE price
inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019.
4 While our projections for hourly compensation and average hourly earnings are essentially
unrevised in the medium term, projected increases for the employment cost index (ECI) have been revised
down to better reflect the lower cyclical sensitivity, and somewhat lower long-run average growth rate, of
this measure compared with the other compensation measures.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
We estimate that economic growth abroad picked up a bit in the fourth quarter of
last year to a modest pace of 2¾ percent at an annual rate. Indicators point to a moderate
recovery in Japan from its tax-induced recession and to a bounceback in Mexico from
surprisingly weak performance in the third quarter, but the pickup in total foreign growth
was damped somewhat by a slowing of growth in Canada and China.
Going forward, we project that economic growth abroad will edge up further to its
k
trend pace of 3 percent this year and remain near that pace through 2017. In the o
o
l
t
advanced foreign economies (AFEs), the acceleration is concentrated in the euro area, u
O
where monetary stimulus and diminishing fiscal drag should support the economy. Much &
l
of the pickup in growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) comes as South e
v
e
America recovers from its recent malaise and the Asian economies outside of China, D
n
following a soft patch, strengthen. The foreign economies, in aggregate, should benefit o
c
E
from solid U.S. growth, depreciated currencies, and lower oil prices. Relative to the l
’
t
n
previous Tealbook, our forecast for the level of foreign GDP over the next couple of I
years is boosted 0.1 percent by the stronger dollar and an additional 0.1 percent by lower
oil prices. The oil price decline would provide a greater boost to the foreign outlook,
except that benefits to oil-importing countries are offset by markdowns to growth in oil-
exporting countries, such as Canada and Mexico, which have high weights in our trade-
weighted aggregate for foreign GDP. Moreover, our foreign outlook is a touch weaker
than in the December Tealbook, as the boosts from the stronger dollar and the lower oil
prices are outweighed by more underlying weakness in some key foreign regions,
including China and South America.
Although the forecast is only slightly weaker, significant risks attend the outlook.
On the downside, the slump in the property market and ongoing decline in the growth of
potential output may result in a more pronounced slowing in China than we currently
anticipate. The prospects for the euro area also remain worrisome. Sharp declines in
inflation could unhinge inflation expectations and weigh on recovery, while the recent
renewal of tensions in Greece may escalate, with greater spillovers to the rest of the euro
area, a scenario we explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook. We
also see upside risks. The decline in oil prices may provide a larger boost to global
growth than currently projected. In addition, as explored in another scenario in the Risks
Page 31 of 88

--- Page 35 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 21, 2015
and Uncertainty section, solid foreign growth that bolsters investor confidence in the
outlook could lead to a lower dollar and higher oil prices, with a net positive effect on the
U.S. economy.
Amid rapidly falling energy prices, headline quarterly inflation turned negative in
the AFEs at the end of 2014, and we project a further decline to negative 1¼ percent at an
annual rate in the current quarter. As oil prices stabilize, we expect AFE inflation to
bounce back to slightly above 1 percent by midyear and gradually rise to 1¾ percent by
2017. With growing concerns over persistently low inflation in the euro area, our
baseline outlook assumes that the European Central Bank (ECB) will announce a
k
o
sovereign bond purchase program at its January 22 meeting. Anticipation of that action
o
l
t
u already has put downward pressure on the euro, contributing to the Swiss National
O
& Bank’s decision to abandon its exchange rate floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro while
l
e cutting its LIBOR target rate to negative 0.75 percent. Similar considerations also
v
e
D prompted Denmark’s Nationalbank to lower its policy rates. In addition, in a surprise
n
o move on January 21, the Bank of Canada (BOC) lowered its target for the overnight rate
c
E
l by ¼ percentage point to 0.75 percent, where we expect it to stay until early 2016.
’
t
n
I Finally, we now anticipate that the Bank of England (BOE) will lift off at the end of
2015, one quarter later than previously assumed, in response to subdued inflation
pressures.
In the EMEs, we estimate that inflation declined from a 3 percent rate in the
middle of 2014 to 2½ percent in the fourth quarter. This relatively modest step-down in
the face of plunging oil prices partly reflects the prevalence of administered energy sector
prices in many EMEs, which lowers the pass-through from changes in oil prices to
consumer prices. Moreover, some EMEs have experienced upward price pressure from
rapidly depreciating currencies. Against this background, most EME central banks kept
monetary policy unchanged since the time of the December Tealbook. Notable
exceptions were the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Bank of Turkey, which cut
their policy rates in January, citing declining inflation pressures, and the Central Bank of
Brazil, which raised its policy rate in response to inflation concerns.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Euro area. Recent indicators point to a mild pickup of economic activity in
the last quarter of 2014. Retail sales, car registrations, and industrial
production through November were above their third-quarter averages.

Accordingly, we estimate that real GDP expanded 1 percent in the fourth
quarter. We project that growth will strengthen to 1¾ percent in 2015 and
increase somewhat further over the next two years. This growth forecast is up
almost ¼ percentage point through 2017. Our baseline scenario assumes that
the heightened political uncertainty and financial stresses in Greece will
persist for some time, but that the spillovers to other countries will be
contained, limiting the drag on euro-area growth. (See the box “Recent
Developments in Greece.”)
Headline inflation declined to negative ¾ percent at an annual rate in the
k
fourth quarter, as energy prices fell. Recent further declines in oil prices are o
o
l
anticipated to push inflation to negative 1½ percent this quarter. As u t
O
commodity prices stabilize and the output gap narrows, inflation should move
&
up to ½ percent in the second quarter and 1¾ percent by end-2017. Amid e l
v
e
weak projected growth and low inflation, we expect the ECB to announce a D
n
new asset purchase program at its January 22 policy meeting. We had already o
c
E
assumed the ECB would purchase about €300 billion of asset-backed
l
’
t
securities and covered bonds in the next two years through its previously n
I
announced program. We now assume the ECB will also purchase
€500 billion of sovereign bonds through the new program. Based on our
estimates, these new purchases should boost the level of euro-area GDP by
¾ percent and inflation by ¼ percentage point over the next two years.
 Japan. Following two consecutive quarters of contraction, real GDP rose an
estimated 3 percent in the fourth quarter. Data through November indicate
that private consumption continued to recover but remained well below its
level before April’s consumption tax hike. In 2015, we see GDP expanding at
a solid 1¾ percent, largely reflecting ongoing monetary stimulus and new
fiscal measures. The recovery should continue in 2016 but then grind to a halt
in 2017, when a second consumption tax hike is implemented. We estimate
that headline inflation declined to negative 1 percent in the fourth quarter.
However, core inflation appears to have remained near 1 percent, partly
reflecting some pass-through from the yen’s depreciation in late 2014. Thus,
we expect headline inflation to bounce back to 1 percent in the second half of
2015 and rise to 1½ percent by 2017. With below-target inflation and

Recent Developments in Greece
After more than two years of relative quiet, the financial situation of Greece has
reemerged as a significant concern. Sapped by mounting public frustration with
fiscal austerity and extraordinarily high unemployment, the Greek government in
December failed to muster the parliamentary supermajority required to elect a
new president. As prescribed by the Greek constitution, the Greek parliament
was subsequently dissolved. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for
January 25, 2015. The leading party in most polls is Syriza, a far-left party that has
advocated for a tougher approach to negotiations with Greece’s official
creditors, with the goal of extracting further debt relief and rollbacks of austerity
k
o measures.
o
l
t
u
O Negotiations over the terms of Greece’s EU-IMF financial assistance program
& have been deadlocked since last fall because the former Greek government
e l resisted calls by the EU and the IMF for more fiscal austerity. In response, the EU
v
e and the IMF have withheld loan disbursements, which the Greek government
D
likely needs in order to avoid default on more than €15 billion worth of debt
n
o
maturing in 2015. More generally, Greece needs to maintain an EU-IMF financial
c
E
assistance program in order to qualify for ECB liquidity support, which accounts
l
’
n t for roughly 15 percent of the Greek banking system’s liabilities.
I
Hence, financial stability in Greece depends on the country’s continuing eligibility
for official financing. The prospect of a Syriza-led government has revived fears
that discussions with official creditors could break down altogether, thereby
depriving Greece of financial support and possibly leading the country to exit
from the euro area.
These fears have reportedly triggered deposit flight from Greek banks and
prompted at least two Greek banks to request emergency liquidity assistance
from the Greek central bank. In addition, spreads on Greek sovereign debt have
risen to their highest levels since mid-2013, as shown in the figure on the
following page. However, in sharp contrast to previous episodes of Greek
financial stress, financial spillovers to other peripheral euro-area countries have
thus far been short lived and limited, likely reflecting three factors. First, credible
financial backstops for other peripheral countries now exist, particularly the
ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program. Second, these peripheral
countries are somewhat more resilient, reflecting some strengthened public
finances, bank capital, and competitiveness. Finally, private foreign investors are
now less exposed to Greece—f or example, euro-area bank claims on Greece
have fallen from $76 billion in late 2011 to $20 billion in mid-2014.
In our baseline forecast, the Greek situation initially deteriorates further, as
political uncertainty persists even after the election, but it eventually stabilizes.
Unless the election gives one party a strong majority, there will initially be a
Page 34 of 88

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 21, 2015
political vacuum while political parties attempt to form a coalition government.
If they cannot agree on a new government, then another election will be
necessary. Should a Syriza-led government emerge, it would likely demand
concessions that its official creditors would find unacceptable. As a result,
brinkmanship among Greece, the ECB, the IMF, and other euro-area countries
could ensue for a time. Ultimately, however, we expect the new Greek
government and its official creditors to compromise, thereby unlocking EU-IMF
financial assistance. In this scenario, the gyrations in Greece’s situation intensify
deposit flight from Greek banks and push up bond spreads in Greece and other
peripheral countries for a time. However, spillovers to the rest of the euro area
are transitory, and the effect on the United States is minimal.
k
However, negotiations could prove even more contentious and protracted than o
o
l
in our baseline, intensifying fears of Greece leaving the euro area. Moreover, an t
u
O
aggressive challenge of EU-IMF orthodoxy by Greece could embolden populist
&
and euroskeptic parties elsewhere in Europe, reviving concerns about peripheral
l
countries’ debt sustainability or core countries’ willingness to provide financial e
v
e
support (including ECB purchases of government debt via the OMT program). As D
a result, peripheral spreads and financial volatility could return to levels reached n
o
during the euro-area crisis in 2012, pushing the euro area back into recession. In c
E
turn, the U.S. economy would suffer from reduced demand from the euro area, l
’
t
n
dollar appreciation in response to safe-haven flows, and significant volatility in
I
global equity and bond markets. (The Risks and Uncertainty section of this
Tealbook examines that alternative scenario in more detail.)
In the extreme, a complete breakdown of negotiations and Greece’s EU-IMF
program could prompt the ECB to terminate its liquidity support to Greek banks,
likely triggering the country’s exit from the euro area. This exit could cause an
even more severe and prolonged euro-area crisis and recession, with significant
disruptions to global financial markets. We continue to place a low probability on
such a scenario, given the large losses to all sides and the Greek public’s
continued interest in keeping the euro. That said, much depends on complex
political negotiations with outcomes that are difficult to predict.

considerable resource slack, we assume that the Bank of Japan will continue
to accumulate assets at the rapid current pace through the end of 2016.
 Canada. We estimate that real GDP growth moderated from 2.8 percent in
the third quarter to 2½ percent in the fourth, consistent with the weaker tone
of incoming labor market data. We see growth remaining near its fourth-
quarter pace through 2016 and then slowing to a near-potential rate of
2¼ percent in 2017. This forecast has been revised down a bit from 2016
onward on the assumption that lower oil prices will lead to reduced
investment in oil extraction. Based on recent declines in energy prices, we
k
o now project that inflation will be negative 1½ percent in the first quarter. As
o
l
t
u oil prices level off, we expect inflation to bounce back to 1½ percent in the
O
& second quarter and reach the Bank of Canada’s (BOC) 2 percent target in
l
e 2017. In response to the expected negative effect of oil price declines on the
v
e
D outlook for growth and inflation, the BOC cut its policy rate to 0.75 percent
n
o on January 21. We now expect the first rate hike in the first quarter of 2016.
c
E
l
’
t
n  United Kingdom. Recent data, including soft PMI readings and declining
I
industrial production, suggest that real GDP growth dropped from 3 percent in
the third quarter to a still-solid 2½ percent in the fourth, a touch lower than
projected in the December Tealbook. We expect that growth will hold at
about this pace in 2015 and 2016 before moderating to 2¼ percent by 2017.
Declines in food and energy prices pushed headline inflation down to negative
¾ percent in the fourth quarter; core inflation also eased. We expect inflation
to increase to the BOE’s target of 2 percent by 2017, as food and energy
prices start rising again and economic slack diminishes. Low inflation
readings and BOE communications prompted us to push out by one quarter
our estimate of the first rate hike to the fourth quarter of this year.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Chinese real GDP growth edged down from 7¾ percent in the third
quarter to just under 7½ percent in the fourth, in line with our forecast in the
December Tealbook, partly reflecting further moderation in residential
investment. For 2014 as a whole, the growth rate was just under the
authorities’ target of 7½ percent and was supported by a sizable net export
contribution. We expect exports to soften in 2015, given the significant
Page 36 of 88

--- Page 40 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 21, 2015
appreciation of the Chinese renminbi against many of its trading partners in
recent months, as the renminbi followed the dollar up. A pickup in domestic
demand from lower oil prices and some increase in policy stimulus will
provide only a partial offset, and thus we see GDP growth moderating to
about 7 percent in 2015 before edging down further to 6¾ percent in 2017.
Relative to the December Tealbook, this forecast is down about ¼ percentage
point through 2017. The drop in oil prices caused inflation to step down to
1 percent in the fourth quarter, but, as energy prices stabilize, we expect
inflation to pick up and settle near 3 percent by the end of the year.
k
 Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP in the rest of emerging o
o
l
Asia expanded at a subdued 3¾ percent pace in the fourth quarter, a slight u t
O
deceleration from the previous quarter. We see growth in the region rising to
&
4½ percent, slightly above its trend rate, in 2015 and holding at about that rate e l
v
e
over the remainder of the forecast period. The step-up in growth largely D
n
reflects the boost from lower oil prices and the projected firming of activity in o
c
E
the advanced economies as well as the dissipation of idiosyncratic factors that
l
’
t
restrained growth last year, including social unrest in Hong Kong. The drop n
I
in energy prices pushed down inflation in the fourth quarter, although this
decline was partially offset by one-off factors, such as the expiration of
housing subsidies in Hong Kong and reductions of fuel subsidies in Indonesia
and Malaysia. As oil prices level off, inflation is expected to rise from
1¾ percent in the fourth quarter to 3¼ percent by mid-2015 and then stay at
about that rate over the remainder of the forecast period.
 Latin America. Incoming data for Mexico, including trade, industrial output,
and vehicle sales, are consistent with our view that real GDP growth stepped
up to 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter following a disappointing 2 percent
pace in the third quarter. We see Mexican growth remaining near 3¼ percent
through 2017, supported, in part, by the effect of past economic reforms. This
outlook is a bit weaker than in the December Tealbook. Continued declines in
oil prices are expected to damp the response of private investment to recent
energy reforms and eventually force a tighter fiscal stance. Headline inflation
remained elevated at 4¼ percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher food
prices and little pass-through of lower oil prices into administered fuel prices.

C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 21, 2015
As food prices normalize, we see inflation moving down to 3¼ percent in the
current quarter and holding at this rate through 2017.
In Brazil, we estimate that real GDP growth edged up in the fourth quarter,
but only to a meager ¾ percent pace. Retail sales grew strongly, but business
confidence was still depressed and exports contracted. Brazilian inflation
remained elevated at 6 percent in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to
moderate to 5¾ percent in the current quarter before settling near 5½ percent
over the remainder of the forecast period. Elsewhere in South America,
Argentina and Venezuela remained mired in recession, and growth in Chile
k
o and Colombia continued to be below trend. Looking ahead, economic growth
o
l
t
u in South America is projected to average a subdued 1 percent rate in the first
O
& half of the year, restrained by lower commodity prices and, in Brazil, tighter
l
e macroeconomic policies. Thereafter, we expect the region’s recovery to
v
e
D gradually firm, with growth rising to 2½ percent in 2016 and a trend pace of
n
o 2¾ percent in 2017. All told, our outlook for South America is almost
c
E
¼ percentage point weaker than in the December Tealbook, reflecting the
l
’
t
n
I negative effects of the recent decline in commodity prices and a less
accommodative policy stance in Brazil.
 Russia and Ukraine. The Russian economy continues to struggle with the
adverse effects of lower oil prices and Western sanctions. Market doubts over
the ability of the authorities to address financial stresses contributed to a free
fall in the ruble and a surge in CDS spreads in mid-December. A series of
policy actions, notably a whopping 650 basis point increase in the policy rate
to 17 percent, and the provision of liquidity and capital support to Russian
banks led to an appreciation of the ruble. Since then, the ruble has resumed
depreciating and CDS spreads have widened, and both are now back to their
mid-December levels. We expect the Russian economy to contract sharply
this year and to recover only weakly thereafter.
In Ukraine, a sharp contraction in real GDP last year and plummeting foreign
reserves have seriously jeopardized the IMF’s Stand-By Arrangement
program agreed to last April. This outcome has increased the risk of a
sovereign default, and the government is currently in talks with the IMF on a
new support package of greater size and longer duration.

GLOBAL IMBALANCES
 With the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries having been an
important source of global imbalances, the fall in oil prices might be expected
to cause a narrowing in global imbalances. Indeed, the current account
surplus of the major oil exporters, including the Middle East, Africa, and
Russia (the green bars in the following figure), fell significantly in 2014 from
recent years and is expected to turn to a deficit in 2015.
 As the figure shows, however, global current account imbalances widened
somewhat in 2014, despite the fall in oil prices, and are projected to remain k
o
o
higher than in recent years. This outcome reflects a number of factors: First, l
t
u
O
some of the current account surplus economies, such as China, other emerging
&
Asia, and the euro area, are oil-importing countries; the surpluses of these l
e
v
economies increased last year as oil prices fell. Second, despite a decline in e
D
the value of oil imports, past appreciation of the U.S. dollar and relatively n
o
c
robust growth result in larger current account deficits for the United States. E
l
’
Finally, as growth strengthens in China’s major advanced-economy trading n t
I
partners, higher demand from these economies should push up China’s current
account surplus. Nevertheless, we expect global imbalances to remain
narrower than in the period preceding the global financial crisis.

Financial Developments
Over the intermeeting period, amid trading that was volatile at times, longer-term
sovereign yields in the United States and other advanced economies declined and the
foreign exchange value of the dollar rose notably. These moves were attributed in part to
a deterioration in market sentiment associated with deflationary pressures abroad as well
as an increased concern about the global economic outlook, a concern that might have
both contributed to and been boosted by further steep declines in oil prices. U.S.
economic data releases were viewed by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on
balance, and the expected path of the federal funds rate declined. The prospect of a near-
term announcement of sovereign bond purchases by the ECB as well as the Swiss
National Bank’s elimination of its exchange rate floor also reportedly contributed to
downward pressure on U.S. and foreign longer-term yields. Equity prices in the United
States and several foreign economies moved higher, on net, over the period.
 The intermeeting change in the path for the federal funds rate implied by OIS
quotes suggested a modest delay in the date of liftoff and a slower pace of
tightening; the implied federal funds rate at the end of 2017 declined about
40 basis points to 1.6 percent. Policy expectations of the respondents to the

balance, in the fourth quarter.1

TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period (including the
December FOMC statement, the Summary of Economic Projections, the Chair’s press
conference, and the December FOMC minutes) were characterized as fairly close to
expectations on balance. U.S. economic data releases, on net, were a bit weaker than
anticipated by market participants, with the lower-than-expected December average
hourly earnings and retail sales numbers garnering some attention. Reflecting these
perceptions and the deterioration in market sentiment, the path of the federal funds rate
implied by a straight read of financial market quotes shifted down. In the Desk’s surveys
of dealers and market participants, the respondents across the surveys continued to view
June as the most likely FOMC meeting for liftoff, although the average probability
assigned to liftoff in July or later increased somewhat. Expectations for the pace of
tightening following liftoff were generally little changed since the December surveys, and
the median expected federal funds rate at the end of 2017 stood near 3 percent across the
two surveys.
These downward revisions to market-based policy expectations and declines in
foreign benchmark sovereign yields pushed nominal Treasury yields lower. On balance,
the Treasury yield curve flattened over the intermeeting period, with the 2-, 5-, and
10-year yields declining 7 basis points, 22 basis points, and 23 basis points, respectively, s
t
n
amid somewhat increased volatility. Longer-term Treasury yields are now near their e

p
historically low levels. (See the box “The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields over
o
l
e
the Past Year” for a discussion of the factors that appeared to have contributed to the drop v
e

in yields.) In addition, the TIPS-based 5-to-10-year measure of inflation compensation

a
declined further, falling 19 basis points to 1.8 percent, its lowest level in a decade. (See c i

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Since the December FOMC meeting, market participants have focused on actual
and anticipated changes in monetary policy abroad coming in response to elevated
downside risks to the economic outlook and very low and declining rates of inflation in a
number of jurisdictions. Greece reemerged as a concern, while Russian financial markets
remained under pressure despite a number of official measures to reduce volatility.

The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields over the Past Year
Despite the increased momentum of the U.S. economic expansion and the expected approach
of liftoff, longer-term Treasury yields have continued to move down over the past year amid a
sharp decline in oil prices and a marked appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The 10-year Treasury
yield is currently at the low end of its historical range and is only a bit higher than the level seen
just prior to the “taper tantrum” in 2013 (figure 1). Similar declines in longer-term yields to
historically low levels have been observed in many advanced foreign economies, continuing the
historical pattern of co-movement in longer-term sovereign yields despite sometimes-divergent
economic fundamentals and expectations for monetary policy (figure 2).
As can be seen in figure 3, the fall in the 10-year yield since early 2014 mainly reflects decreases
in forward rates at horizons of 4 years and beyond. Indeed, the 1-year forward rate 9 years
ahead dropped more than 200 basis points over this period to the lowest levels in more than
30 years. By contrast, the 1-year forward rate 1 year ahead increased steadily over the same
period, reflecting investor expectations about the timing of liftoff of the federal funds rate.
Over this period, the 10-year TIPS real yield has declined 52 basis points and inflation
compensation has fallen substantially, by 65 basis points, while survey-based measures of
inflation expectations have remained stable (see the box “An Update on Measures of Longer-
Term Inflation Compensation and Inflation Expectations”).
Staff models can be used to decompose the 10-year yield into the average of expected future
short-term rates over the next 10 years and a term premium that compensates investors for the
risks associated with longer-term fixed-income assets. According to these models, the decline
s in the 10-year yield since the beginning of 2014 primarily reflects reductions in the term
t
n
e premium, while expected short-term interest rates over the next 10 years have also moved
m
down modestly. In contrast, survey respondents and the staff appear to have revised up their
p
o projections for the average future federal funds rate over the same period, likely reflecting the
l
e
v expected approach of liftoff and despite frequent market discussions about the possibility of
e
D secular stagnation.1 This upward revision in average expected future short rates would imply an
l
a even greater decline in the term premium.
i
c
n
a
n Other than the possibility of somewhat higher concerns about the tail risks of deflation and
i
F
persistently low interest rates in the United States, market participants have cited three main
explanations for the continued decline in term premiums. First, a weaker global economic
outlook and deflationary pressures abroad are thought to have led to increased demand for
U.S. Treasury securities, putting downward pressure on their yields. While some of this
increased demand may reflect safe-haven flows, investors might also have rebalanced their
portfolios, increasing the weight of U.S. Treasury securities, as sovereign yields in many
advanced economies have been declining and now lie significantly below U.S. Treasury yields.
For example, some investors have reportedly engaged in a so-called carry trade by borrowing at
1 Between December 2013 and December 2014, the expected average federal funds rate over the next
10 years rose about 10 basis points, according to the Desk’s Primary Dealer Survey. Over the same period, staff
projections for the 40-quarter-ahead average of the federal funds rate increased about 40 basis points.

lower rates in other currencies and investing the proceeds in higher-yielding U.S. Treasury
securities, thereby putting downward pressure on Treasury yields. However, direct evidence of
the magnitude of such carry trades is typically hard to find.
Second, holding U.S. Treasury securities might have become less risky. Market-based measures
of the relative risk of outsized increases in long-term rates—such as the swaption-implied
skew—came down noticeably over the course of 2014, suggesting that market participants
became less concerned about large upside movements in Treasury yields over the year
(figure 4).2 In addition, the CAPM beta, which measures the co-movement between returns on
U.S. Treasury bonds and broad equity returns, moved down further in 2014, indicating that
Treasury bonds may have become a better hedge against stock market fluctuations (figure 4).
Last, institutional factors could have amplified price movements in Treasury markets. For
example, a rapid unwinding of short positions in Treasury securities might have amplified the
decline in yields. However, one measure of such behavior, the net long speculative position in
10-year Treasury futures, did not increase significantly over the past year (figure 4).
Regression analysis indicates that proxies for these three factors can account for only about
one-fourth of the decline in the 10-year term premium over the past year, suggesting that a
large portion of the decline in the term premium remains puzzling.3

An Update on Measures of Longer-Term Inflation Compensation
and Inflation Expectations
Measures of longer-term inflation compensation from TIPS and from inflation swaps, such as 5-to-
10-year forward inflation compensation, have declined notably since last summer to levels
comparable to those last seen during the 2008 financial crisis (figure 1). In contrast, survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations have generally remained stable over that period
(figure 2). Recent FOMC statements have noted these developments and stated that the
Committee would continue to monitor inflation developments closely. This box provides an
update on these developments.1
Both TIPS- and swaps-based measures of inflation compensation reflect not only expected
inflation but also an inflation risk premium, as well as other premiums driven by liquidity
differences and shifts in the relative supply and demand of nominal versus inflation-indexed
securities. Staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and New York maintain
term structure models that aim to disentangle the various components of inflation compensation
and to provide estimates of inflation expectations and risk premiums. Nominal Treasury yields,
along with inflation swap rates in the Cleveland Fed model and TIPS yields in the two other
models, are modeled as functions of a small number of factors. The Board model has a separate
latent factor to capture the potential departure of TIPS yields from the “true” real yields, while
the New York Fed model ties the TIPS liquidity premium to several observed liquidity indicators in
the TIPS market. In contrast, the Cleveland Fed model does not explicitly account for other
premiums that might be associated with inflation swaps. The three models also differ in other
aspects of their specifications and in their implementation, which could potentially lead to
significant differences in their results.
s
t As shown in figure 3, staff models generate relatively stable estimates of 5-to-10-year inflation
n
e expectations and do not indicate notable declines in longer-term inflation expectations since last
m
p summer. As seen in figure 4, while the New York Fed model points to notably lower inflation risk
o
e l premiums over this period, the Board and the Cleveland Fed models show only a modest decline
v
e in the inflation risk premium and attribute a large portion of the decline in inflation compensation
D
to changes in other unexplained premiums (not shown).

A decline in inflation risk premiums appears to be consistent with the relative changes in the
distributions of future inflation derived from surveys and from inflation caps and floors. Survey-
based distributions of 5-to-10-year forward inflation have generally remained stable since last
summer (figure 5). In contrast, the risk-neutral distribution derived from inflation caps and floors
suggests that investors may have become more concerned about lower inflation outcomes and
less concerned about higher inflation outcomes since that summer (figure 6).2 This shift could
reflect an increase in the perceived likelihood of low inflation outcomes as well as an increased
willingness to pay higher premiums for insurance against such outcomes, perhaps because
investors increasingly associate them with poor economic performance.
In summary, despite the recent notable decline in longer-term inflation compensation, surveys
and staff models generally continue to point to stable longer-term inflation expectations. Staff
models estimate that the inflation risk premium has declined somewhat, and that investors may
have become more concerned about the risk of low inflation outcomes, thereby contributing to
the decline in inflation compensation. A number of other factors, including increased demand for
U.S. nominal Treasury securities in response to an increase in perceived downside risks to
economic activity and inflation overseas, may have also placed downward pressure on nominal
Treasury yields and hence on inflation compensation (see the box “The Decline in Long-Term
Treasury Yields over the Past Year”).

On January 15, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) terminated its policy of defending
an exchange rate floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro, responding in part to resurgent
capital inflows as investors anticipated further easing from the ECB, and lowered the
interest rate it pays on sight deposits from negative 0.25 percent to negative 0.75 percent.
The Swiss franc appreciated sharply following the announcement and ended the
intermeeting period about 9 percent stronger against the dollar. Volatility in foreign
exchange markets increased following the move, and Swiss equity prices fell notably,
with shares of UBS and Credit Suisse underperforming the broader market. Effects on
U.S. large, systemically important financial institutions were reportedly small, while
some hedge funds and retail foreign exchange brokers suffered sizable losses.
Advanced foreign economy (AFE) sovereign yields have continued to decline, on
net, since the December FOMC meeting. Yields in the United Kingdom fell about
25 basis points over the intermeeting period, and 10-year German yields declined about
15 basis points, reflecting in part the anticipated ECB announcement of sovereign bond
purchases. Longer-term market-based measures of inflation compensation in the euro
area moved down further over the period. Swiss yields, which fell sharply following the
SNB decision to lower its policy rate, recorded negative rates for maturities up to
10 years.
Reflecting the uncertainty associated with upcoming elections, in which the anti- s
t
n
e
austerity Syriza party may garner a plurality of votes, yields on Greek sovereign bonds m
p
climbed to about 9 percentage points above those on comparable-maturity German bonds. o

violations, ending the period up about 5 percent.

appreciated about 8 percent against the euro, as prospects for sovereign bond purchases
by the ECB increased. In a surprise move on January 21, the Bank of Canada cut its
policy rate 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, prompting an immediate 2 percent
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.
Russian CDS spreads narrowed and the ruble appreciated in late December
following steps taken by the central bank and the government to stabilize financial
markets and shore up the banking sector. However, since the end of the year, financial
market stresses have resumed: CDS spreads and the ruble both returned to near their
mid-December levels, and Fitch Ratings and S&P both downgraded Russia’s sovereign
credit rating to one notch above “junk” status.
EQUITY PRICES AND BUSINESS FINANCE
In recent weeks, U.S. equity markets were volatile, but the major indexes ended
the period up about 2½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting period. Stock prices for
large energy firms, which had fallen sharply over the previous intermeeting period,
increased, on net, about in line with the overall market. The VIX fell back from its mid-
December highs but subsequently retraced to end the period down just a touch, on
balance, at the high end of its range over the past year.2

speculative-grade issuance late in the year dropped more than would be expected based
on historical patterns. Early indicators suggest that bond issuance has been subdued this

month, particularly for speculative-grade firms. Nonfinancial commercial paper
outstanding was about unchanged in the fourth quarter.
Commercial and industrial loans continued to expand at a robust rate last quarter.
According to the January SLOOS, banks reported stronger loan demand from large and
middle-market firms. However, several banks reported having tightened standards and
terms for oil and gas firms. Moreover, some banks indicated that they expected to see
some deterioration in the credit performance of syndicated leveraged loans over this year.
Institutional leveraged loan issuance in the fourth quarter was at its slowest pace in two
years, as spreads on newly issued loans increased and refinancing activity declined
significantly. Origination of new-money loans, however, ran at about the average pace of
the past two years, driven by merger and acquisition activity. U.S. CLO issuance
declined but remained solid, and 2014 was the strongest year on record for the issuance
of such securities.
In the fourth quarter, financing for the commercial real estate (CRE) sector stayed
accommodative regardless of loan size and property type. In the January SLOOS, banks
reported that standards continued to ease, on net, for CRE lending and cited stronger
demand for all CRE loan types. The volume of CMBS issuance stayed solid in
November and December, supported by low interest rates and steady increases in
property values. CMBS spreads remained narrow through the end of December. s

mortgage credit had increased somewhat, although mortgage lending standards continued a l

to be tight for borrowers with less-than-pristine credit histories. Respondents to the n

January SLOOS indicated that lending standards on GSE-eligible home-purchase loans F i
eased in the fourth quarter, perhaps reflecting in part the GSEs’ announcement that they
will start purchasing loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the
announcement that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will reduce mortgage
insurance premiums by about one-third relative to the level that prevailed during the past
four years is expected to make FHA loans more attractive to borrowers. More generally,
the price of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers fell further over the intermeeting
period: The 30-year fixed mortgage rate declined 16 basis points. Taking a longer
perspective, mortgage rates have fallen about 75 basis points over the past year and are
not far from their all-time lows reached in 2012. Likely owing to the recent declines in

mortgage rates, applications for refinances rose considerably in the past two weeks,
reaching their highest level since the second half of 2013. Nevertheless, refinance
applications remain much lower than the level seen in 2012 and the first half of 2013.
Conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely accommodative over the
intermeeting period. Auto and student loan balances continued to post significant growth
through November, while the expansion of credit card loans on banks’ books remained
moderate during the fourth quarter as a whole. Respondents to the January SLOOS
indicated that demand for auto and credit card loans had strengthened further in the fourth
quarter, while standards and terms for these loans were little changed on net. Issuance of
consumer ABS continued to be robust last quarter, and yield spreads on ABS remained
tight.
Consumer credit quality stayed strong, on balance, with delinquencies on credit
card loans hovering near historical lows. The credit performance of auto loans, however,
reportedly deteriorated a bit further for lenders holding sizable amounts of subprime
loans, and several banks indicated in the January SLOOS that they expected the
performance of subprime auto loans held on their books to worsen this year.

increased shipments to countries in the former Soviet Union, which reportedly
experienced a surge in public demand for U.S. dollars. The monetary base increased at
an annual rate of about 32½ percent last month, primarily reflecting the increase in
reserve balances associated with the mid-month maturity of nearly $400 billion in term
deposits.
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Testing of the Federal Reserve’s term and overnight reverse repurchase agreement
(term RRP and ON RRP) operations continued over the intermeeting period.3 Although
the first two term auctions (conducted prior to the December FOMC meeting) were
oversubscribed, the third and fourth term operations were undersubscribed; money
market funds accounted for the majority of take-up in all four operations. Term RRP
take-up cumulated to $226 billion, and ON RRP take-up on December 31, 2014, climbed
to $171 billion. The unwinding of the term operations on January 5, 2015, was orderly,
and no market dislocations were reported.
Overall, the ON RRP and term RRP operations appeared to ease downside rate
pressures in money markets over year-end.4 On December 31, the effective federal funds
and Eurodollar rates did not fall below the ON RRP offered rate, and the overnight repo
rate for Treasury collateral, as surveyed by the Desk, stayed within a range of 9 to
s

11 basis points through the year-end period.5 However, some upside pressures emerged n

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first
scenario, wage growth is significantly lower than in our baseline outlook, leading to a
lower path of headline price inflation in coming years. The next two scenarios explore
the implications of misperceptions about potential output. In the second scenario,
potential output grows faster than in the baseline, whereas the third scenario features a
deeper and more protracted reduction in potential output growth. These two scenarios
have opposing implications for the indicated pace of policy tightening. The fourth
scenario examines the possibility that the better-than-expected improvements in the labor
market and in GDP growth in recent months portend a stronger pace for the economic
expansion and higher inflation over the projection period. In the fifth scenario, foreign
economic growth is significantly weaker than in our baseline outlook, as spillovers from
a reemergence of crisis in Greece trigger a recession in the euro area. The final scenario
considers the possibility that faster foreign growth leads investors to reassess the risks to
the global economy and push down the dollar.
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its
effective lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast—b y an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using
a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in
the Committee’s recent statements.1 In all cases, we assume that the size and
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.
yy
1As in the baseline, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in June 2015. In the discussion of tt
nn
several scenarios, we also consider the implications of introducing an inflation floor to capture the aa ii
tt
Committee’s intention to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate “e specially if projected ee rr
cc
inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal,” as described in the December nn
UU
FOMC statement. For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the
&&
FRB/US simulations. One key difference relative to the FRB/US simulations is that the policy rule in
ss
SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of kk
ss
the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices. RR ii

Weaker Wage Growth
The markup of prices over unit labor costs has been rising steadily since 2000. In
the baseline projection, this markup roughly flattens out over the forecast period as gains
in hourly labor compensation pick up from around 2 percent in recent years to
3½ percent, on average, during 2016 and 2017. However, little acceleration is yet
evident in the data. In this scenario, we assume that hourly compensation rises only
2 percent per year from 2015 to 2019, about the rate observed over the past five years. In
the FRB/US model, weak wage growth passes through to lower headline inflation; this
pass-through is only partial, however, so the markup continues to rise.
Inflation declines persistently as a result of the lower wage growth, falling below
1 percent in 2018. GDP growth and the unemployment rate remain very close to baseline
through 2016 but deviate more significantly after 2017; the unemployment rate is
0.4 percentage point lower than in the baseline at the end of 2019, reflecting a distinctly
more accommodative monetary policy.2
In light of the large and persistent decline of inflation in this scenario, monetary
policymakers might alternatively choose to implement an inflation floor similar to that
discussed in note 1. Under this kind of policy, the federal funds rate would stay at its
effective lower bound through 2019. The added stimulus would boost real activity and
inflation, but inflation would nonetheless remain well below the Committee’s long-run
objective.
Room to Grow
Both unemployment and inflation have continued to surprise us on the downside.
One potential reason why wage and price gains have remained modest despite falling
unemployment may be that the staff’s estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is
too high. In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been
lower in the past five years than assumed by the staff and that it continues to fall,
eventually reaching 4.2 percent later this year, 1 percentage point below the current
yy
tt
nn
2 Given the tenuous nature of the empirical evidence linking labor costs to inflation, we also aa ii
tt
consider the possibility that there is no pass-through from labor compensation to headline inflation. In this ee rr
cc
case, the markup rises a touch more steeply than in the scenario reported in the text. As a result of a lower nn
UU
propensity to spend by firms relative to households, GDP growth is about ¼ percentage point lower at the
&&
end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. The unemployment rate is about 0.1 percentage point higher on
ss
average. The federal funds rate lifts off in the second quarter of 2015, but rises less steeply, reaching kk
ss
3½ percent in 2019. RR ii

estimate in the baseline. In addition, we assume that structural productivity gains in
recent years have been about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline. With these
assumptions, potential output rises, on average, about ½ percentage point more than in
the baseline over the 2015–1 9 period. The output gap closes only in the middle of 2017.
Inflation stays below the baseline through 2019, reflecting diminished pressures
from resource utilization. The federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound for
an additional year, lifting off in the second quarter of 2016. The unemployment rate
continues falling after 2016, closing the unemployment gap at the end of 2017 and
moving below the assumed natural rate thereafter. Real GDP growth picks up, reaching
close to 4 percent in the first half of 2017 before slowing to just below 3 percent by the
end of 2019. This acceleration is due not only to higher structural productivity, but also
to more accommodative monetary policy.3
No Room to Grow
Contrary to the premise of the previous scenario, this one considers the possibility
that the natural rate may be higher and structural productivity growth lower than in the
baseline, consistent with some of the models we consult. Specifically, we assume that
structural productivity gains in recent years have been slower than the staff currently
estimates and will continue to be so over the projection period. In addition, we assume
that the natural rate of unemployment has been declining more slowly than in the baseline
since early 2011 and will reach 5.2 percent only by the end of 2019. With these
assumptions, potential output has expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent, on average,
since 2011, about 0.4 percentage point below the baseline; looking ahead, it rises at a
1½ percent pace through 2019. As a consequence of this revision to potential output, the
output gap is estimated to have closed in the third quarter of 2014 and real GDP currently
stands ½ percent above potential.
Compared with the baseline, GDP growth is about 1 percentage point slower in
2016 and 2017, as households and firms condition their spending on lower levels of— and
slower anticipated growth in— permanent income and potential output. Inflation is

utilization and lower productivity. Inflation reaches the Committee’s target by the
middle of 2017 and remains just above this level in 2018 and 2019. The unemployment
rate begins to move up slowly in 2016 and reaches 5.4 percent in 2019, 0.3 percentage
point higher than in the baseline and 0.2 percentage point above its natural rate. The
federal funds rate rises more steeply than in the baseline in the first six quarters after
liftoff.
Faster Recovery with Higher Inflation
Over the past year, the unemployment rate has continued to move down
appreciably. At the same time, lending standards have continued to ease, manufacturing
output growth has been solid, oil prices have fallen, and fiscal policy restraint has faded.
In this scenario, these favorable developments solidify household and business
confidence about the durability of demand going forward; the resulting strong spending
growth supports a much more robust economic recovery than in the baseline. We also
assume that inflation will be more sensitive to reductions in resource slack than is
implicit in the FRB/US model, in line with the larger cyclical effects on inflation in some
DSGE models.
Real GDP growth is close to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, compared with
2¾ percent in the baseline projection; the unemployment rate falls to about 4¼ percent by
the end of 2017. With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in
the baseline, reaching 2½ percent at the beginning of 2019.4 The federal funds rate lifts
off in the second quarter of 2015, as in the baseline, but rises more steeply thereafter,
passing 4 percent in the second half of 2017 and 5 percent at the end of 2018. Given
enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the
unemployment rate to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent.
Recession in the Euro Area
As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook box
“Recent Developments in Greece,” we assume that the euro area will experience only
modest and short-lived spillovers from developments in Greece, reflecting our view that
yy
tt
Greece is likely to work out a compromise with its international creditors that gives it nn
ii

renewed access to EU-IMF financial assistance. However, the euro area is clearly rr

4 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially steeper wage and price

would have peaked at 2 percent. RR ii

vulnerable to much worse outcomes. In this scenario, we consider the possibility that
heightened anxiety about an exit of Greece from the euro area— as debt negotiations
break down— has much larger adverse spillovers, especially to the periphery, and pushes
the euro area back into recession.
Specifically, we assume that ongoing problems in Greece cause periphery
sovereign and private borrowing spreads to rise about 250 basis points above baseline by
the middle of this year and euro-area consumer and business confidence to
decline. These developments in turn prompt the ECB to expand its purchases of euro-
area sovereign bonds by €500 billion more than we have already built into the baseline.
Notwithstanding this aggressive monetary easing and a 10 percent further depreciation of
the euro against the dollar, euro-area GDP contracts 1½ percent in 2015 and only rises
about 1 percent in 2016. Our scenario also assumes that the EMEs experience a modest
tightening in financial conditions and depreciation of their currencies against the dollar.
U.S. real exports fall relative to baseline in response to the weaker foreign activity
and a 5 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar. Nevertheless, given that financial
spillovers to economies outside of Europe are assumed to be quite limited in this scenario
and that U.S. monetary policy has scope to slow the pace of tightening, the overall effect
on the U.S. economy is fairly contained. All told, U.S. real GDP expands roughly
2 percent in 2015, ¾ percentage point less than in the baseline. Lower domestic and
imported inflation cause U.S. core inflation to run at about 1 percent in 2015 and
2016. The federal funds rate lifts off at the same time as in the baseline but follows a
shallower path after liftoff.
Greater Confidence in Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar
Some of the dollar’s sharp appreciation since June appears to reflect markets’
increasing confidence in U.S. growth prospects, even as the outlook for foreign growth
has become somewhat more uncertain and the risk of adverse outcomes more
pronounced. This scenario assumes that foreign growth runs only modestly higher than
in our baseline—about ½ percentage point in 2015— but that the more favorable
yy
tt
nn incoming data gradually increase confidence that growth abroad will be solid and
ii
aa
rr tt sustained. This more sanguine foreign growth outlook in turn causes the broad real dollar
ee
cc
nn to depreciate about 6 percent relative to baseline by end-2016— undoing about half the
UU
&& dollar’s appreciation since June—and helps boost the Brent price of oil about $15 above
ss
kk its baseline path.

Despite the drag from higher oil prices, the weaker dollar and stronger foreign
growth boost U.S. real activity by causing U.S. real net exports to expand relative to the
baseline. Core PCE inflation runs well above baseline as the weaker dollar puts upward
pressure on import prices, resource slack narrows more quickly, and some modest pass-
through of higher oil prices occurs. All told, U.S. real GDP expands by about 3¼ percent
in 2015, about ½ percentage point more than in the baseline. Core PCE inflation runs
above 2 percent in 2016 and 2017, while the unemployment rate falls to about
4½ percent. The federal funds rate lifts off at the same time as in the baseline, but rises
more quickly thereafter.
