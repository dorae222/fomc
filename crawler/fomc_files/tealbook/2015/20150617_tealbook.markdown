Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The economic expansion appears to have downshifted modestly: After increasing D
n
2½ percent last year, real GDP looks to be on track to rise at an annual rate of only o
c
E
1 percent over the first half of this year, even assuming—as we do—that some of the
c
i
t
factors that weighed on spending early in the year have already unwound. Over the s
e
m
second half, we expect real GDP growth will step up to a 2 percent annual rate. Such a o
D
pace would exceed our assumption for the economy’s potential growth rate by
½ percentage point, but it would also be a few tenths slower than we anticipated in the
April Tealbook, as we have become more guarded in our assessment of the outlook for
household spending.
One reason we have not reacted more strongly to the recent slowdown in
spending is that conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. After slowing
some in the first quarter, payroll employment posted stronger gains in April and May.
Meanwhile, the employment-to-population ratio has continued to converge toward our
estimate of its trend at the same pace that we anticipated in the April projection.
Beyond the near term, we expect that real GDP growth will be 2½ percent in 2016
before edging down to 2¼ percent in 2017. All told, the growth that we anticipate is
sufficient to close the output gap by the end of 2017, much as in the April Tealbook. The
unemployment rate is expected to edge down from 5.5 percent in the second quarter of
this year to 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016—in line with our estimate of its
natural rate—and to remain there through the end of the medium term. As in previous
forecasts, we continue to expect that an unwinding of the current unusual weakness in
labor force participation will attenuate the speed at which the jobless rate declines going
forward.
Our outlook for inflation is little revised. As in the April Tealbook, we have core
inflation gradually moving up from 1¼ percent this year to 1¾ percent in 2017 as import
prices turn back up, resource utilization tightens, and the effects of earlier sharp declines
in energy prices wane. Over most of the medium term, we expect total PCE inflation to
run roughly in line with core inflation. The recent data provide some evidence that
compensation is accelerating; smoothing through the quarterly volatility, we continue to
expect that compensation growth, as measured by the employment cost index (ECI), will

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
e
v
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP,
D
following the March FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current
n
o economic projection with the one we presented in the March Tealbook.
c
E
c
i Since the March projection, we have revised down our forecast for real GDP growth this
t
s
e year, primarily reflecting the weaker‐than‐expected incoming data on aggregate
m
o spending. Our forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 is slightly higher than in
D
March, mostly because our projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar is
lower. Altogether, these revisions leave our projection for the GDP gap next year and in
2017 weaker than in the March forecast. The unemployment rate has declined a little less
than we expected in March and is projected to average 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter
of this year. Reflecting both the recent labor data and our lower projected path for
aggregate output, the unemployment rate is revised up a little at the end of 2017 to
5.2 percent, equal to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate.
The staff’s projection for headline PCE inflation has been revised up somewhat in the first
half of this year, mostly reflecting recent higher‐than‐expected readings for consumer
energy prices, and projected core PCE inflation is essentially unchanged. Given our
assumptions that longer‐run inflation expectations will remain stable over the medium
term, the earlier declines in energy prices were transitory, and core import prices will
start to rise after this year, our forecasts for headline and core inflation in 2016 and 2017
are little changed. We continue to project that inflation will run somewhat below the
Committee’s 2 percent objective through 2017.

Since the March Tealbook, our assumption for the date of liftoff of the federal funds rate O
from its effective lower bound was changed from the second quarter to the third quarter &
l
of this year. Reflecting both the later assumed liftoff date and the softer GDP gap in the e
v
current forecast, the projected path for the federal funds rate is around ½ percentage D
e
point lower at the end of next year and in 2017 than in March. n
o
c
E
Because FOMC participants are providing additional information about their expectations c
i
of the economic conditions that will exist at the time they anticipate it will first become s
t
e
appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, we include the table m
o
below providing quarterly information from the staff projection. In the third quarter of D
this year—the quarter when our baseline projection assumes liftoff of the federal funds
rate will occur—we forecast the unemployment rate to average 5.4 percent and the
trailing four‐quarter change in real GDP to be 1.5 percent. We project the trailing four‐
quarter change in core PCE inflation to be 1.2 percent, and the four‐quarter change in
headline PCE prices to be only 0.2 percent because of earlier decreases in energy prices.
(We do not anticipate that these energy price declines will fall out of the four‐quarter
change in headline inflation until early next year.) Of course, even the preliminary
versions of these readings on economic performance will not become available until after
the close of the quarter in question.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
D
e
n
o
Monetary Policy c
E
c
 We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its i
t
s
e
effective lower bound after the September meeting. As in our previous m
o
projections, the post-liftoff trajectory of the federal funds rate is assumed to be D
governed by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule. The
projected path of the federal funds rate is a touch lower than in the April
Tealbook—mainly because the output gap is slightly weaker in this forecast—
and reaches an average of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Other Interest Rates
 Our forecast continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise
significantly. The projected increase in the Treasury yield reflects the
movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of extremely
low short-term interest rates, as well as an increase in term premiums that is
partly attributable to the waning of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet
policies. Compared with the April Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield is a
little higher over the next couple of quarters due to the recent increases in
market rates, but it is a touch lower thereafter.
 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium
term have been revised essentially in line with the changes to the path for the
Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices are projected to rise 4½ percent per year over the forecast
period, a somewhat slower pace than in the April Tealbook. We continue to
expect a notable decline in the equity risk premium; however, at the end of
2017 the level of the premium is somewhat higher than what we had assumed
in April, which better aligns it with historical norms.
 Incoming data on house prices for the first quarter led us to boost our forecast
for house price appreciation in 2015 to 5 percent, compared with 3¾ percent

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 10, 2015
k
o
o
l
u t in the April Tealbook. We continue to expect house prices to decelerate to an
O
average pace of 3 percent per year in 2016 and 2017.
&
l
e
v
e Fiscal Policy
D
n
o  We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.
c
E
We continue to anticipate that, after having been a small drag on real GDP
c
i
t
s growth in 2014, fiscal policy actions at all levels of government will provide a
e
m
small stimulus in 2015 and over the remainder of the medium term.
o
D
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign real GDP growth slowed a little more than expected in the first
quarter, to a 1½ percent annual rate, and—at 2¼ percent—is projected to be a
bit weaker in the current quarter than in our previous forecast. For 2015 as a
whole, projected foreign growth is down a little from the April Tealbook,
reflecting the softer-than-expected tone of recent data, the lower path for U.S.
GDP, and—in the advanced economies—some restraint from recent increases
in long-term interest rates. We continue to expect foreign GDP growth to rise
to 3 percent by early next year, supported by accommodative monetary policy
abroad, depreciated currencies, and still-low oil prices, and to remain at that
pace through 2017.
 The broad nominal dollar is down a touch relative to the April Tealbook. We
project that the dollar will appreciate 2 percent through the remainder of 2015
as investors intensify their focus on the divergence between monetary policies
in the United States and abroad. Thereafter, as foreign monetary policy
begins to normalize and as tail risks for the euro-area economy diminish, the
dollar is projected to weaken. Our forecast leaves the level of the broad real
dollar at the end of the medium term slightly lower than in the previous
Tealbook.
Oil Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil is up nearly $3 per barrel since the time of
the April Tealbook; however, prices for futures contracts with delivery at the
end of 2017 are unchanged, continuing the trend of flattening futures curves.
We expect the price of imported oil to move up from $57 per barrel this
quarter to about $62 per barrel by the end of the forecast period. Relative to

o
o
l
the April Tealbook, the projection is about unchanged this year and is down u t
O
about $1 per barrel at the end of 2017.
&
l
e
v
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP e
D
n
o
As we discuss in the box “Special Factors Contributing to Weakness in GDP in c
E
the First Quarter,” we believe that a portion of the weakness in first-quarter aggregate c
i
t
s
demand reflects a variety of identifiable temporary factors whose effects will be largely e
m
reversed in coming quarters.1 But early indications are that second-quarter real GDP will o
D
only rise enough to leave average growth over the first half of this year in the
neighborhood of 1 percent. As in previous Tealbooks, we attribute much of the first-half
slowdown in GDP to the stronger dollar and the drag on drilling and mining investment
from sharply lower oil prices. Relative to the April Tealbook, the slightly more subdued
GDP picture for the first half is more than accounted for by weaker-than-anticipated
indicators of household spending and net exports.2
We continue to expect, however, that the economy will expand at a moderate pace
over the projection period. In particular, despite the generally disappointing news on
consumer spending, we still view the fundamentals underpinning household demand as
sufficient to support an acceleration in real PCE going forward. Likewise, we expect
drilling and mining investment to bottom out relatively soon as the effects of the declines
in oil prices recede. In total, we expect real GDP growth to average about 2 percent in
the second half of this year, ¼ percentage point lower than our April projection.
 As noted, the recent data on real PCE have been weaker than we expected
overall despite a surge in light motor vehicle sales in May. As a result, we
have lowered our projection for second-quarter real PCE growth
1½ percentage points relative to our previous forecast, to 2¾ percent.3
Moreover, the recent disappointment extends a tendency during each of the
past several years for consumer spending to come in on the low side of our
expectations. Hence, while we still anticipate a near-term acceleration in real
1 Note that real gross domestic income (GDI), which aims to measure the same economic concept
as real GDP, is reported to have increased at a 1½ percent annual rate in the first quarter.
2 The table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q2 Real GDP Growth” provides forecasts
of second-quarter output growth from other near-term forecasting approaches used within the System.
3 The Quarterly Services Survey for the first quarter of 2015, released as the Tealbook projection
was closing, was not incorporated in our estimate of first-quarter real PCE growth. In addition, the May
retail sales report is scheduled to be released on June 11, 2015, the day after the Tealbook is published.

Special Factors Contributing to Weakness in GDP in the First Quarter
&
l
e
e
v
A number of transitory factors appear to have restrained aggregate spending in the first quarter,
D
and the unwinding of their effects is expected to provide a boost to spending this quarter. The
n
o staff’s estimates of the effects of these factors on real GDP are shown in the table below. While
E
c
we discuss point estimates here, there is, of course, considerable uncertainty around the
c magnitude of these estimates, and other analysts—including from within the Federal Reserve
i
t
s System—have judged some of these effects to be larger than the staff’s estimates.
e
m
o
D Residual seasonality is estimated to have subtracted 0.8 percentage point from the change in real
GDP last quarter (line 2). Residual seasonality appears evident in real spending for exports, state
and local government construction, and private‐sector nonresidential construction, along with
the change in inventory investment. The staff assumes that much of the first‐quarter residual
seasonality will be unwound in the second quarter, with the rest showing up in the second half.
Unusually severe winter weather is estimated to have subtracted 0.2 percentage point from the
change in real GDP in the first quarter, as PCE and construction spending were held down
temporarily (line 3). The bounceback in spending from this weather effect is assumed to raise
second‐quarter real GDP growth by a similar amount.
Numerous reports suggested that the West Coast port labor dispute restrained international
trade and disrupted some manufacturing supply chains. The staff estimates that the port labor
dispute shaved 0.2 percentage point off the change in real GDP in the first quarter and assumes
that a comparable amount will be added to second‐quarter real GDP growth as activity returns to
normal (line 4).
Finally, the large declines in retail gasoline prices early this year likely caused some measurement
error in the BEA’s translation to real PCE of nominal retail sales by some big‐box stores that also
sell gasoline (line 5). The staff estimates that this measurement error reduced real GDP growth
0.2 percentage point in the first quarter but that it is unlikely to reverse in the near term, as
gasoline prices are not projected to return to their earlier levels.
In total, these identifiable transitory factors are judged to have reduced the change in real GDP
1.4 percentage points last quarter (line 6). The corresponding bounceback in spending as these
factors disappate is projected to boost real GDP growth 1 percentage point this quarter.

O
previous increases in household wealth, and upbeat consumer sentiment, we
&
e l have taken our forecast for second-half real PCE growth down about
v
e
D ¾ percentage point relative to April, to an average annual rate of 3½ percent.
n
o
c
E  The decline in oil prices over the past year has resulted in a sharp drop in
c
t i drilling and mining investment that subtracted ½ percentage point from first-
s
e
m quarter real GDP growth and looks set to take a similar amount off of growth
o
D
in the current quarter. We expect the declines in drilling and mining
investment to slow markedly over the second half of the year, and, indeed, we
think we see early signs of such a bottoming out in the weekly data on rig
counts.
 Housing starts rebounded strongly in April from the weak readings seen in
February and March, while permits edged up. We interpret the April strength
in starts as largely reflecting payback from the earlier weakness and so have
left our forecast for starts essentially unrevised going forward. This contour
of starts leaves our estimate for the level of residential investment somewhat
higher in the current quarter relative to our previous forecast but not much
different at the end of 2015.
 We now estimate that net exports subtracted nearly 2 percentage points from
real GDP growth in the first quarter, a considerably larger drag than we had
projected in the April Tealbook. The revision is almost entirely due to import
data for March coming in much stronger than we had anticipated, as inbound
shipments snapped back following the resolution of the labor disputes at West
Coast ports. For the first quarter as a whole, the port disputes seem to have
had little net effect on imports, which rose at an above-average 6¾ percent
pace. In contrast, exports declined sharply in the first quarter; we attribute a
sizable portion of this weakness to the port disruptions and to residual
seasonality in the export data. We expect some payback in the growth rate of
exports in the current quarter—an expectation that is supported by the April
trade data—and now have the external sector making a less negative second-
quarter contribution to real GDP growth than in the April Tealbook.
Reflecting the continued drag from past dollar appreciations, net exports are
expected to subtract ¾ percentage point from real GDP growth in the second
half of 2015, nearly unchanged from the April Tealbook.

 Total industrial production continued to decline through April, and the u
O
available indicators, including manufacturing production-worker hours, point &
l
to a further decline in May. As with first-quarter GDP, we think that a e
v
e
combination of transitory factors (such as supply-chain disruptions arising D
n
from the labor disputes at West Coast ports) and longer-lived influences (such o
c
E
as the stronger dollar) have weighed on manufacturing output; similarly,
c
i
t
production at both factories and mines has been affected by the sharp declines s
e
m
in drilling activity noted previously. We expect manufacturing production to o
D
rise at a subdued pace over the remainder of the near term, as the stronger
dollar and the upstream effects of lower oil and gas prices continue to damp
demand for factory output. The mixed tenor of the national and regional
manufacturing surveys seems consistent with such an outcome.
With conditioning factors that are broadly unrevised relative to April, projected
real GDP growth over the medium term is quite close to our previous forecast: In 2016,
we expect real GDP to rise 2½ percent before edging down to a 2¼ percent pace in 2017.
Actual GDP growth is expected to outpace our estimate of potential growth in coming
years, resulting in a steady narrowing of the output gap.
 We expect above-trend growth in aggregate demand to be led by gains in
consumer spending. As labor market conditions continue to improve, real
personal income should rise faster than potential output; in addition, over
much of the medium term, high wealth-to-income ratios and increasing
confidence about the durability of the expansion should lead spending growth
to modestly exceed income growth. (For a discussion of risks stemming from
a consumer-led expansion, see the box “Alternative View: The Risk of
Significant Macroeconomic Imbalances over the Medium Term.”)
 In broad terms, the relatively flat contour of real GDP growth over the
medium term reflects the interplay of two forces. First, the ongoing
normalization of monetary policy is expected to weigh more heavily on
aggregate demand growth going forward. However, as the effects of previous
increases in the exchange value of the dollar wane—and with the dollar
expected to begin depreciating later in the forecast period—we anticipate that

& Alternative View: The Risk of Significant Macroeconomic
l
e Imbalances over the Medium Term
v
e
D
n
o The U.S. economy is approaching a state in which inflation and unemployment are about as
c
E close to the FOMC’s current objectives as has been true at virtually any point over the past half-
c
i century. Despite these conditions, the risk of growing macroeconomic imbalances in the U.S.
t
s
e and global economy is substantial. In particular, the relatively stronger growth outlook and
m
o higher interest rates in the United States may spur domestic asset prices and contribute to a
D
global recovery that is overly reliant on U.S. consumption. Such developments would imply low
national saving and a large U.S. current account deficit despite inflation and unemployment
running reasonably close to their objectives over the next couple of years. A state of affairs in
which the global economy is overly reliant on U.S. household demand would echo aspects of
the economic conditions in the mid-2000s, when the combination of low U.S. savings and large
current account imbalances contributed to the financial excesses that precipitated the crisis.
Although overreliance on U.S. household demand may be a concern even along the path
envisioned in the staff projection, a starker illustration of the risks can be seen by considering an
alternative projection. In this alternative, strong demand for U.S. assets, in part due to low
global interest rates, leads the low level of term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities to persist
for several more years. Low interest rates contribute to more rapid growth in equity and house
prices than in the staff projection. Moreover, the gains in U.S. asset prices and the higher level
of U.S. interest rates (relative to those in Europe and Japan) draw capital to the United States
and cause the dollar to appreciate roughly 20 percent from its level early this year, bringing its
value back to the level of the early 2000s.1
While the higher level of equity and house prices and lower term premiums boost aggregate
demand, the strong dollar offsets this boost, and the unemployment rate remains close to its
natural rate over the next couple of years. However, core inflation remains stuck near
1¼ percent over this period, reflecting the effects of dollar appreciation, and short-term interest
rates are lower than in the staff projection, with the federal funds rate remaining below
1 percent until early 2017 (according to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule).
Domestic and global imbalances are substantial in this alternative view. The higher level of
household wealth contributes to a more rapid increase in personal consumption expenditures
than expected in the staff outlook, and the personal saving rate falls to 2½ percent later this
decade (figure 1). Global imbalances reemerge on a scale similar to that seen in the mid-2000s,
with the U.S. current account deficit falling to 5½ percent of nominal GDP (figure 2).
Note: This alternative view was prepared by Michael Kiley.
1 Although this alternative view uses an FRB/US model simulation to illustrate the effects of shocks to term
premiums, house prices, and the dollar, the key elements of this alternative view are not tied to the FRB/US
model’s structure or the precise quantitative results from such a simulation.

These large domestic and international imbalances could create several challenges for the U.S. O
and global economy. First, the stretched position of U.S. households leads them, over time, to &
l
attempt to rebuild their savings, placing a drag on both consumption and investment and hence e
v
e
upward pressure on unemployment by 2017. A weak rate of investment and elevated D
borrowing from abroad lower U.S. potential output and national income, placing a persistent n
o
drag on U.S. living standards. And the limited savings buffer of U.S. households and the c
E
elevated level of U.S. asset prices imply some risk of a painful retrenchment, as households may c
i
t
have limited ability to weather adverse shocks and elevated domestic asset prices could s
e
collapse when unexpected adverse developments materialize. m
o
D
Monetary policy is not well suited to address these challenges: A more accommodative
monetary policy stance would only marginally boost inflation (given the flat Phillips curve) and
would likely further depress household saving, borrowing from future aggregate demand and
leaving households even more vulnerable to adverse shocks. In principle, fiscal policy
adjustments that boost domestic saving while supporting domestic productive investment
would alleviate these imbalances. More direct tools to alleviate global imbalances would
consist of coordinated international adjustments in fiscal and monetary policy (and related
structural reforms), including increases in spending in countries with current account surpluses.
While the unsustainable pace of U.S. consumption in the scenario above is importantly due to
an alternative perspective on the possible effect of low global interest rates on U.S. asset prices
over the next couple of years, these forces are only one set that could lead to similar
macroeconomic imbalances. For example, some staff models project that the household saving
rate will decline more rapidly than in the staff projection, or the appreciation of the dollar that
has already occurred may lead to a wider U.S. current account deficit than anticipated.
Alternatively, the global economy would be even more reliant on U.S. household demand if
growth among foreign economies were to fall substantially short of expectations, which could
also contribute to a stronger dollar and lower U.S. interest rates.

e THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
D
n
o
c Taken together, the two employment reports that we have received since the April
E
c Tealbook indicate that conditions in the labor market have improved in recent months—
i
t
s
e albeit at a slower pace than last year—and were close to our expectations in the April
m
o
forecast. Thus, we have made only small revisions to our near-term outlook for the labor
D
market.
 Payroll employment growth averaged 250,000 per month in April and May,
about 30,000 more than our previous projection.
 The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in May, 0.1 percentage point higher
than expected. However, the labor force participation rate also came in
0.1 percentage point higher than expected last month, leaving the
employment-to-population ratio in line with our previous forecast.
 For the first five months of this year, payroll gains have averaged 217,000 per
month, down from 260,000 per month in 2014; in addition, the pace of decline
in the unemployment rate has slowed this year. The staff’s labor market
conditions index also indicates that the pace of improvement in labor market
conditions has slowed relative to 2014.
 We expect payroll employment to rise 215,000 in June and to increase at a
similar average monthly pace over the second half of this year—about the
same as in the April Tealbook.
 We expect the unemployment rate to average 5.5 percent in the current quarter
(0.1 percentage point above our April forecast) before declining to 5.3 percent
in the fourth quarter (unrevised relative to April).
4 As noted, the expected depreciation in the dollar—which occurs even as U.S. monetary policy
continues to tighten—reflects both a reversal of earlier safe-haven flows and the eventual move to a less
accommodative policy stance on the part of foreign monetary authorities.

The medium-term outlook for the labor market is also little changed relative to u t
O
our previous forecast, consistent with the relatively small revisions we have made to the
&
l
projected path of output. e
v
e
D
 We expect monthly payroll gains to slow to 175,000 in 2016 and 140,000 in n
o
c
2017 as productivity moves back up toward its trend. E
c
i
t
s
e
 The unemployment rate is projected to edge down from 5.3 percent in the m
o
fourth quarter of this year to 5.2 percent by the end of 2016 and then to remain D
at that level throughout 2017.
 As in previous Tealbooks, we think that the unemployment rate gap currently
understates the amount of slack remaining in the labor market because the
labor force participation rate is unusually low and the level of involuntary
part-time employment is unusually high. As the economy improves further,
we expect additional individuals to be drawn into the labor market and the rate
of involuntary part-time employment to move down. As a result, the decline
in the unemployment rate is slower than it would otherwise be, yielding a
projected path for the unemployment rate that is basically flat over much of
the medium term despite output continuing to rise moderately faster than
potential.
 As shown in the exhibit “Alternative Measures of Slack,” output gaps from
the Philadelphia Fed’s PRISM model and—to a lesser degree—the New York
Fed’s DSGE model currently suggest more slack than the staff’s
unemployment rate gap. The National Federation of Independent Business

somewhat tighter labor market conditions.5
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
After declining at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, headline PCE
prices are expected to rise 2 percent in the second quarter. The turnaround is attributable
to a large swing in energy prices and a pickup in core PCE inflation from ¾ percent in the

first quarter to 1½ percent in the second. During the second half of the year, both total u t
O
and core PCE inflation are expected to step down slightly from the second quarter,
&
reflecting a deceleration in energy prices and a continuation of the pattern in which e l
v
e
residual seasonality in core prices tends to boost inflation in the second quarter and D
n
reduce it in the second half. o

c
i
 Our forecast for second-quarter total PCE inflation is ½ percentage point t
s
e
m
higher than our April projection. The revision is largely attributable to an
o
D
upward surprise to gasoline prices that we expect to be unwound in coming
quarters as margins return to a more normal level.
 Consumer food prices have come in a little lower than expected (to date, we
have seen little evidence that drought conditions in California are materially
affecting retail food prices). We expect consumer food prices to accelerate
over the near term to a pace that is roughly in line with core PCE inflation.
 The most recent readings on core PCE inflation have come in a little below
our April Tealbook projection: The nonmarket component of the index was
distinctly weaker than we had expected, with this surprise only partly offset
by a stronger reading on market-based core PCE prices. As usual, we have
taken little signal from the miss on nonmarket inflation, which tends to be
quite erratic. For market-based inflation, the miss was concentrated in
categories that we believe are particularly affected by residual seasonality. In
response, we slightly revised up our estimate of the contribution that residual
seasonality will make to market-based inflation over the next couple of
months, and made a corresponding downward revision to our inflation
projection later in the year. In total, our forecast for overall core PCE
inflation in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year averages
1½ percent at an annual rate, unchanged relative to April.
We continue to project that core PCE price inflation will rise from 1¼ percent this
year to 1¾ percent in 2017, as import prices turn back up, the effects on core inflation of
previous large declines in energy prices dissipate, and resource utilization tightens further
in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations. With consumer food and
energy prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices after this year, we expect
total PCE inflation to run at about the same pace as core inflation throughout most of the
medium term.

 Readings on longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The
final May estimate of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the
Michigan survey was 2.8 percent, close to the middle of the range within
which this measure has fluctuated in recent years. In the second quarter,
expected PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of
Professional Forecasters remained essentially unchanged at 2 percent for the
10th quarter in a row. Finally, TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation
compensation are little changed, on balance, since the April Tealbook, though
they remain below levels that prevailed until last summer.
The recent data provide some evidence that labor compensation is accelerating, as
we have expected for some time.
 The employment cost index for private industry workers rose at an annual rate
of 3 percent over the first quarter; over the past 12 months, the ECI increased
2¾ percent, noticeably above the 2 percent average pace seen over the past
few years. Business-sector hourly compensation from the Productivity and
Costs release rose at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter; in
addition, the fourth-quarter growth rate was revised up 1½ percentage points,
to 3 percent.
 As labor markets tighten further over the forecast period, we expect an
additional slight acceleration in hourly compensation, with the 12-month
change in the ECI reaching 3 percent in 2016.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK u t
O
&
 The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an l
e
v
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. This policy rule assumes a long-run e
D
equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3½ percent. n
o
c
E
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to put downward c
i
t
s
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent. The e
m
o
process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be D
completed by 2021.
 The natural rate of unemployment is 5.2 percent, and potential GDP rises at a
rate of about 1.8 percent per year, on average, from 2018 to 2020.
 As monetary accommodation continues to be withdrawn, real GDP growth
eases to 1.9 percent in 2018. Thereafter, real GDP rises at a pace just below
the growth rate of potential output. The unemployment rate declines slightly
below 5.2 percent in 2018 and 2019 before edging up to its natural rate.
 PCE price inflation remains below the long-run objective of the Committee at
the end of 2017 but gradually moves up to 2 percent by 2019.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign real GDP growth slowed by almost 1 percentage point in the first quarter
to 1½ percent, a rate about ¼ percentage point lower than previously estimated. A
0.6 percent contraction in the Canadian economy, where investment has been hard-hit by
earlier declines in oil prices, accounted for much of both the slowdown and the
downward revision, although there was a significant step-down in growth in several of
the emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. Recent indicators of foreign economic
activity, including data on PMIs and trade, suggest that total foreign growth is picking up
k
o
in the second quarter, although not quite as much as we had anticipated, to a rate of o
l
t
u
2¼ percent. O
&
l
e
Beyond the current quarter, we expect foreign GDP growth to increase to v
e
D
3 percent by early next year as the Canadian economy shakes off the effect of the lower
n
oil prices and the euro area continues on its moderate recovery path, supported by o
c
E
expansionary monetary policy. We also expect some acceleration in activity in EMEs, l
’
t
n
supported by policy stimulus in China and stronger demand in the advanced economies. I
Many foreign economies should also benefit from depreciated currencies. This
projection has been revised down slightly since April, reflecting the softer-than-expected
tone of recent data, the lower path for U.S. GDP, and some restraint from recent increases
in long-term interest rates in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs).
Despite indications that the pace of foreign activity is picking up, there is still a
significant risk that growth will not recover as projected, which might also prompt the
dollar to appreciate more than we are assuming. We explore the effects of such a
scenario on the U.S. economy in the Risks and Uncertainty section. The situation in
Greece continues to represent another important risk to our outlook. Our baseline
forecast assumes that negotiations between Greece and its creditors will continue to be
contentious, and it encompasses the possibility that Greece might be forced to impose
capital controls and miss some debt payments. However, it assumes that spillovers to
other peripheral countries will remain contained. In the alternative scenario “Greek Exit
with Severe Spillovers,” we examine the possibility that the situation in Greece
deteriorates much more than in the baseline, resulting in a disruptive Greek exit from the
euro area that roils global financial markets and pushes Europe back into recession.

Equilibrium Interest Rates in the Advanced Foreign Economies
The equilibrium interest rate—t he real interest rate consistent with output at potential and
inflation at its target—p lays a central role in assessing the stance of monetary policy, with policy
expansionary (contractionary) if the short-term real interest rate lies below (above) this
benchmark. Estimates of the equilibrium interest rate, however, can vary greatly over time as
both cyclical and structural developments affect its level, with implications for the path of the
policy rate that would be consistent with achieving the objectives of monetary policy. Here we
discuss estimates of equilibrium interest rates in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) based
on two alternative approaches.
k Our first empirical framework is an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
o
o model. This model consists of a Phillips curve equation (which relates inflation to output gaps),
l
t
u an IS equation (which relates output gaps to the deviation in the real policy interest rate from the
O
equilibrium interest rate), and a Taylor rule (which describes monetary policy). The estimation
&
technique assumes that output growth, inflation, and the policy rate all fluctuate around stable
l
e
v averages, thus helping to identify cyclical fluctuations in potential output and the equilibrium
e
D interest rate from those data.1
n
o
c
E Figure 1 on the following page shows the evolution of the AFE aggregate equilibrium interest rate
l
t ’ estimated using this approach. According to our DSGE model, the aggregate AFE equilibrium
n
I interest rate declined by an outsized and unprecedented amount during the global financial crisis
and the European debt crisis; the rate currently stands about 4 percentage points below its
steady-state value of nearly 2 percent. Moreover, the effects of the recession are deemed to be
very persistent: Absent additional shocks, the AFE aggregate equilibrium interest rate in 2020 is
still projected to be more than ½ percentage point below its nearly 2 percent steady-state value.
Thus, this evidence suggests that the slow recovery in AFE aggregate demand should lead to only
a very gradual normalization of AFE policy rates toward pre-crisis average levels.
As previously noted, the DSGE-based approach imposes a constant steady-state value on the
equilibrium interest rate and abstracts from trend changes in its path. However, Laubach and
Williams (2003) provide econometric evidence indicating that the long-run value of the
equilibrium interest rate in the United States has drifted down considerably over the past several
decades.2 Their approach is somewhat different, as—s tarting from an empirical framework that
includes an IS equation and a Phillips curve equation—t hey focus on estimating the link between
slow-moving changes in the equilibrium interest rate and the trend growth of output.
Figure 2 presents estimates of this trend concept of the equilibrium interest rate that are based
on applying a methodology very similar to that in Laubach and Williams (2003) to data from the
1 Our model and estimation follow Vasco Cúrdia, Andrea Ferrero, Ging Cee Ng, and Andrea Tambalotti (2015),
“Has U.S. Monetary Policy Tracked the Efficient Interest Rate?” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 70 (March),
pp. 72– 83.
2 Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics
and Statistics, vol. 85 (March), pp. 1063– 70.

AFE economies.3 According to this approach, the AFE equilibrium interest rate (shown by the red
line) has fallen steadily over the past 15 years and is currently negative. A number of possible
structural factors have been put forward to account for this decline in the long-run value of the
equilibrium interest rate. For example, potential output growth appears to have stepped down,
partly reflecting demographic trends and the effects of the global financial crisis on financial
intermediation and productivity. In addition, from an open-economy perspective, the sizable
upward shift in global savings in the early to mid-2000s may have contributed to lower world
interest rates.
The estimates based on the Laubach and Williams (2003) methodology suggest that, absent
developments that would push the long-run equilibrium rate back up, aggregate demand and the
associated neutral policy rates in the AFEs are likely to be much lower than in the early 2000s and
k
will not return to pre-crisis levels, as in the first approach. An implication is that, going forward, o
o
l
even shallow recessions may take policy rates in the AFEs to the zero lower bound constraint. t
u
O
&
All told, both cyclical and trend estimates suggest that equilibrium interest rates in the AFEs are
l
currently low and will likely remain so for many years. However, the degree to which the decline e
v
e
is due to cyclical versus structural factors—i n other words, how low the equilibrium rate will be in D
the long run—r emains difficult to disentangle with confidence. Moreover, in either approach, n
o
confidence intervals around estimates of the equilibrium interest rate tend to be very large. c
E
Finally, some of the structural factors that may have contributed to lower long-run equilibrium l
’
t
n
interest rates over the past decade may still unwind. For instance, global savings could
I
conceivably fall going forward, as Asian economies rebalance toward domestic demand
somewhat, thus putting upward pressure on global interest rates. Choosing an appropriate path
of policy rates over time in AFEs will thus require important judgments related to these
uncertainties.
3 Our methodology differs from Laubach and Williams (2003) in two respects. First, we use staff estimates of
potential output for the AFEs rather than treat this variable as unobserved. Second, we construct real policy rates
using survey-based measures of inflation expectations rather than construct inflation expectations using an
autoregressive process on estimated inflation data, as these authors do. When we apply our methodology to U.S.
data, however, we obtain estimates very similar to the original article, suggesting that these changes have a
modest effect on the results.

Quarterly foreign inflation appears to have bottomed out along with oil prices in
the first quarter, and it is expected to turn positive in all of the major AFEs in the current
quarter. Inflation is projected to reach central bank targets of 2 percent in Canada and the
United Kingdom by 2017, and to pick up but remain below the 2 percent objective in
both the euro area and Japan at the end of the forecast period. Inflation rates in EMEs
also appear to be increasing and are expected to average about 3 percent over the forecast
period.
We continue to expect monetary policy to remain quite accommodative in most
foreign economies. We assume that both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the
k
o
Bank of Japan will keep rates constant and continue to implement their plans for further
o
l
t
u quantitative easing over much of the forecast period. We anticipate that the Bank of
O
& England (BOE) will begin to increase its policy rate in early 2016 and that the Bank of
l
e Canada (BOC) will do so a quarter later. Nonetheless, even for the BOE and the BOC,
v
e
D we expect only modest increases in policy rates over the forecast period, consistent with
n
o the view that equilibrium interest rates in the AFEs will remain low for many years (see
c
E
l the box “Equilibrium Interest Rates in the Advanced Foreign Economies”). Central
’
t
n
I banks of some major EMEs, including China and India, have loosened monetary policy
since the most recent FOMC meeting. A prominent exception is Brazil, where policy
rates have been tightened further to contain inflation.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Euro area. Real GDP grew 1.5 percent in the first quarter as domestic
demand strengthened, and recent indicators, including PMIs and retail sales,
are consistent with our estimate of an expansion at about the same pace in the
current quarter. We expect GDP growth to rise to 2 percent in 2016 and
2¼ percent in 2017. This forecast is a touch weaker than our April Tealbook
projection, reflecting the tightening of financial conditions in recent weeks:
As noted in the Financial Developments section, government bond yields in
the euro area have risen substantially, and the euro has appreciated about
4 percent in nominal effective terms.
Twelve-month inflation rose further to 0.3 percent in May, the first positive
reading since last November. We expect quarterly inflation to jump to
2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from negative 1½ percent in
the first quarter, with energy prices contributing positively to total inflation for
Page 40 of 96

--- Page 44 ---

C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 10, 2015
the first time since mid-2013. Inflation should settle around 1½ percent by the
end of the year and then gradually pick up to 1¾ percent over the remainder of
the forecast period as the output gap narrows. We continue to expect ECB
asset purchases to total about €1.2 trillion by September 2016 and the ECB’s
main policy rate to stay near zero through the end of 2017.
Although Greece averted default on its obligations to the IMF in early May,
its situation remains precarious. Greece and its creditors continue to disagree
over the terms of official financial assistance, even as two deadlines for a deal
approach. First, after postponing several debt repayments to the IMF due
k
earlier in the month, the Greek government faces a June 30 deadline to repay o
o
l
the IMF about €1.6 billion. Second, the Greek government’s eligibility to u t
O
receive financial assistance from the European Financial Stability Facility
&
(EFSF) is currently set to expire at the end of the month. e l
v
e
D
Greece and its creditors are working on a deal to extend Greece’s EFSF n
o
c
program and to release some of its funds. There is some chance these talks E
l
’
will fail, in which case the Greek government may well miss a debt t
n
I
repayment, the ECB could curtail liquidity support to Greek banks, and
Greece might have to impose capital controls. Even in this instance, however,
our baseline forecast assumes that the associated financial and political
tensions will ultimately motivate Greece and its creditors to put the existing
financial assistance program back on track and, subsequently, to cover
Greece’s medium-term financing needs with a new multiyear program. In
addition, our baseline forecast assumes that financial spillovers to the rest of
the euro area are contained. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that
the Greek situation will spiral out of control, resulting in a Greek exit from the
euro area and broader turmoil in global financial markets.
 Japan. Real GDP growth picked up to 3.9 percent in the first quarter, almost
3 percentage points above our estimate in the April Tealbook. However, the
surprise was partly due to a substantial contribution from inventory
investment. Thus, we expect GDP growth to slow to a still above-trend pace
of 1½ percent in the current quarter and to remain at about that rate through
2016 before a second hike to the consumption tax rate stalls the expansion in
2017. Consumer prices edged down further in the first quarter, reflecting a
drop in energy prices and a slowdown in core price increases. With oil prices
Page 41 of 96

--- Page 45 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 10, 2015
turning up, inflation should increase to ½ percent in the second quarter.
Thereafter, as the output gap narrows and inflation expectations rise, we see
inflation (excluding the direct effect of the consumption tax hike) rising to
almost 1½ percent by the end of 2017.
 Canada. Real GDP declined 0.6 percent in the first quarter, as earlier declines
in oil prices took a toll on investment in the energy industry. The first-quarter
growth rate was considerably weaker than expected, reflecting surprisingly
soft private consumption that was due, in part, to the severe winter weather.
Recent data point to a modest rebound in economic activity starting in the
k
o second quarter; the manufacturing PMI picked up in May, although it
o
l
t
u remained slightly contractionary. We now expect growth to bounce back to
O
& nearly 1½ percent in the second quarter and to increase further to about
l
e 2½ percent by the end of the year, supported by the BOC’s accommodative
v
e
D monetary policy, a weak Canadian dollar, and firming U.S. growth. This
n
o projection has been revised down a little for 2015, as we have carried forward
c
E
l some of the recent weakness in consumption. With oil prices having turned
’
t
n
I around and projected to move up a little further, we see inflation bouncing
back to 1¾ percent in the second quarter and reaching the BOC’s 2 percent
target by 2017.
 United Kingdom. Real GDP growth slowed to a 1.2 percent pace in the first
quarter, nearly 1 percentage point below the April Tealbook projection.
Domestic demand growth picked up, but exports declined after surging in the
fourth quarter, and import growth remained high. With readings on economic
sentiment remaining solid and retail sales growth increasing, we expect GDP
growth to bounce back to a 2½ percent pace in the second quarter and to
maintain that pace through 2016. After falling at a 1.6 percent rate in the first
quarter, consumer prices are estimated to have risen nearly 1 percent in the
second quarter, reflecting stabilizing energy prices. With labor market slack
projected to dissipate slowly and inflation projected to rise only gradually to
the BOE’s 2 percent target, we continue to expect the BOE to wait until the
first quarter of 2016 before raising its policy rate.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Chinese real GDP growth is estimated to have picked up from just
5.1 percent in the first quarter to a still-subdued 6 percent in the second. The
estimate for the second quarter reflects mild improvement across a range of
indicators. Industrial production and exports strengthened in April following
a weak first quarter, and exports rose further in May. The pace of house price
declines has lessened while sales have increased recently, suggesting that the
drag on activity from the property sector is diminishing. Meanwhile, retail
sales continued to rise at a healthy rate. We expect GDP growth to increase to
k
a 7¼ percent pace in the second half of the year, supported by recent and o
o
l
further monetary easing as authorities seek to keep growth near their 7 percent u t
O
target for this year. Financial conditions have become more accommodative
&
in recent weeks, as the interbank rate has declined 2 percentage points e l
v
e
following the 100 basis point cut in banks’ reserve requirement ratios in April. D
n
Economic activity should also be supported beyond the current quarter by a o
c
E
strengthening of exports as demand in China’s trading partners improves and
l
’
t
as the drag from last year’s appreciation of the real trade-weighted renminbi n
I
lessens. Over the medium term, we continue to see growth moderating to
6½ percent, in line with our estimate of declining potential growth.
We expect consumer price inflation to come in at an annual rate of 1½ percent
in the current quarter after having dipped below zero in the first quarter in
response to falling food and fuel prices. We expect inflation to rise further to
2½ percent by the end of the year and to remain around that rate over the rest
of the forecast period.
 Other Emerging Asia. First-quarter growth was surprisingly weak in several
emerging Asian economies, due primarily to plummeting exports. The
disappointing first-quarter outcomes, along with the mixed tone of more
recent indicators, including exports and PMIs, prompted us to lower our
estimate for GDP growth in the current quarter by ½ percentage point to
3¾ percent, up only slightly from the first-quarter rate. Nevertheless, we
continue to expect growth in the region to move up to 4¼ percent in the
second half of the year, in response to improved activity in China and in the
advanced economies, and to remain at roughly that rate, supported by low oil
prices and accommodative monetary policies. We judge that, for now, the
Page 43 of 96

C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 10, 2015
outbreak of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in Korea will have
little effect on the region’s growth, although it poses downside risks. Inflation
in the region, which was slightly negative in the first quarter as a result of
falling energy prices, is expected to turn positive this quarter and move up to
3¼ percent by 2016.
 Latin America. Mexican real GDP growth dropped to 1.6 percent in the first
quarter, a little below our April Tealbook estimate. Demand-side components
will be released later this month, but monthly data indicate weakness in
external demand for manufactured goods (in line with the contraction in U.S.
k
o production) and in fixed investment, particularly residential housing. In
o
l
t
u addition, oil production has continued to decline. A rebound in U.S. auto
O
& production, along with more-upbeat recent data on exports and PMIs, are
l
e consistent with our projection of a pickup in GDP growth to 2½ percent in the
v
e
D current quarter, and we expect further improvement to 3¼ percent over the
n
o forecast period. Headline inflation is expected to move up to 3¼ percent later
c
E
l this year from just ¼ percent in the first quarter as the influence of earlier
’
t
n
I declines in energy and administered telecommunication prices fades.
In Brazil, real GDP contracted at an annual rate of ½ percent in the first
quarter, a considerably smaller drop than we had expected, as a sharp decline
in private domestic demand in response to tighter monetary policy and weak
confidence was partly offset by a surprisingly large jump in exports.
However, much of the rise in exports was reversed in April and May, and
other recent indicators, including the manufacturing PMI and industrial
production, also have been weak. As a result, we now expect GDP to contract
3¼ percent in the current quarter. Despite the weak economy, the substantial
depreciation of the real and increases in administered prices have kept
inflation stubbornly high, at an estimated 9¼ percent annual rate in the current
quarter. To restrain inflation, the central bank has raised its policy rate by a
cumulative 275 basis points since October 2014, including an increase of
50 basis points on June 3. We expect these moves to support the real and
bring inflation down to 5¾ percent by the end of this year and to 5½ percent
by 2017, allowing policy to begin to ease by mid-2016. The loosening in
policy should contribute to an increase in real GDP growth to a still-sluggish
1¾ percent next year and to 2¼ percent in 2017.

Financial Developments
Over the intermeeting period, longer-term Treasury yields increased notably amid
heightened volatility, evidently boosted by rising core euro-area sovereign bond yields
and, to a lesser extent, stronger-than-anticipated domestic labor market news late in the
period. The sharp rise in core euro-area yields, though difficult to fully explain, appeared
to reflect an increase in expected future short-term rates following some positive
European economic data releases, as well as a notable rise in term premiums from
significantly compressed levels.
 On net, 10-year nominal Treasury and German bund yields rose 43 basis
points and 79 basis points, respectively. TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation were little changed over the period.
 Results of the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market
participants indicated that September remained the most likely time of liftoff,
with the expected pace of normalization after the liftoff little changed. The
path of the federal funds rates implied by OIS quotes shifted up beyond 2015,
likely reflecting in part an increase in term premiums.

TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS
Over the intermeeting period, longer-term Treasury yields rose substantially amid
significant volatility. Market participants linked the yield movement primarily to the
sharp rise in core euro-area sovereign bond yields, which many anecdotal reports
attributed to investors abandoning their views about the profitability of the so-called QE
trade, a set of positions designed to benefit from a further decline in core euro-area
yields. Treasury yields also rose notably following the stronger-than-expected May
employment report. On net, the nominal Treasury yield curve steepened appreciably over

the intermeeting period, with 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury yields increasing about 15,
34, 43, and 50 basis points, respectively. The changes for the 10- and 30-year Treasury
yields stand at the 90th and 95th percentiles, respectively, of the distributions for changes
over intermeeting periods since 1990. (For a more detailed discussion of Treasury yield
movements, see the box “U.S. Treasury Yields and Global Factors during the
Intermeeting Period.”)
Most of the increase in nominal yields was attributable to a rise in real yields, as
5-year inflation compensation was little changed and 5-to-10-year inflation compensation
rose only a bit.
Federal Reserve communications following the April FOMC meeting were
characterized by investors as generally in line with expectations and elicited limited
market reaction. With respect to the FOMC statement and the minutes, market
participants reportedly focused on the changes to the Committee’s assessment of the
economy—in particular, the language that the slower economic growth during the winter
months “in part” reflected “transitory factors.”
On net, the path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes steepened
markedly beyond 2015, with some portion of the increase coming on the heels of the May
employment report. A significant portion of the pickup, however, may reflect higher
s
t
n
term premiums. Indeed, the modal forecasts of the federal funds rate through 2018 from e
m
the Desk’s June surveys of dealers and market participants were little changed since the p
o
l
April survey, and respondents again saw the September 2015 meeting as the most likely e
v

date for the first increase in the federal funds rate target range. The probability of liftoff
l
a
at or after the September meeting increased somewhat, with the probability of liftoff at i
c
n
the June 2015 meeting falling to near zero. The expected pace of tightening after the a

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Since the April FOMC meeting, foreign sovereign bond yields increased,
especially at longer maturities, and foreign stock prices generally moved down. The
nominal exchange value of the dollar strengthened, on net, over the period.
Benchmark sovereign bond yields in the advanced foreign economies rose sharply
starting in late April. After falling back somewhat in late May as Greek concerns became

U.S. Treasury Yields and Global Factors during the
Intermeeting Period
Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose notably, on net, amid heightened volatility during
the intermeeting period. The 10-year Treasury yield (the black line in figure 1 on the next
page) increased 30 basis points over the first two weeks of May and reached 2.35 percent
on May 13, its highest level since December. After retracing somewhat toward the end of
May, Treasury yields again increased sharply in June, leaving the 10-year yield higher by
43 basis points, on net, since the April FOMC meeting. TIPS yields increased nearly as
much as nominal yields, leaving inflation compensation little changed on net. Available
evidence points to developments in the euro area as the main driver of the rise in
Treasury yields, as sharp increases in German yields appeared to spill over into the
U.S. Treasury market; by contrast, domestic developments appear to have played a
limited role.
The rise in U.S. yields coincided with similar increases in foreign yields (figure 1), and, in
particular, the sharp rise in German yields (the green line). The correlation between U.S.
and euro-area yields has historically been high, but as shown in figure 2, the correlation
between far-forward rates in both countries appears to have increased over the past
year. Furthermore, results from a Granger causality test (shown in figure 3) provide some
evidence that the probability that movements in far-forward German yields can help
predict movements in their U.S. counterparts has increased again recently (the red line),
with the probability moving closer to levels last seen during the euro-area debt crisis.
Finally, figure 4 shows that staff models attribute the increases in both U.S. yields and
s German bund yields largely to higher term premiums.
t
n
e
m
The sharp increase in German term premiums appears to have been mostly the result of a
p
o
l reassessment among market participants of the substantial decline in German yields that
e
v began in early 2014. That decline—perhaps predicated on investor perceptions of
e
D
significant tail risks such as protracted deflation associated with the sharp decline in oil
l
a prices and a further worsening of the global growth outlook—gained further momentum
i
c
n when the ECB began its purchase program of euro-area sovereign bonds in March, and
a
n pushed German yields with maturities up to eight years below zero. It is possible that the
i
F
decline in German yields and term premiums was subsequently viewed as excessive,
resulting in the rise in yields and premiums we saw during the intermeeting period,
although what triggered the revision in investors’ views is not entirely clear.
Although the rise in both German and U.S. yields can be primarily attributed to increases
in term premiums, the expected rate component rose as well. Some better-than-
expected euro-area economic data—in particular, the release of the euro-area CPI for
May, as well as some stabilization of oil prices—appear to have boosted primarily the
expected rate component of German yields (the red dashed line in figure 4). Meanwhile,
although the expected rate component in U.S. yields (the blue dashed line) initially
remained stable amid an absence of significant changes in the U.S. economic and
monetary policy outlook, the more recent and pronounced increase in expected rates

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 10, 2015
appeared to be supported by some better-than-expected domestic economic news, such
as the ISM data and the May employment report. Nonetheless, increases in U.S. yields in
June again appeared in large part to be driven by the sharp increase in German yields, as
the selloff of German bunds resumed, particularly following ECB communications that
were interpreted as lacking concern about the recent increase in market volatility.
In summary, the increase in U.S. yields over the intermeeting period does not seem to
reflect major changes in the domestic economic or monetary policy outlook but rather a
rise in term premiums that was closely linked to yield developments in the euro area,
which in turn appeared to be largely driven by investors reassessing the level of valuation
in the German bund market.1 This reassessment appears to have initiated an unwinding
of widely held positions in euro-area sovereign bonds, particularly by momentum-driven
investors, which may have exacerbated the rise in yields.

1 In response to a special question in the June Desk survey, the median dealer attributed more than
two-thirds of the 36 basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield between late April and early June
to higher term premiums. The selloff in core European sovereign bond markets was the most cited
factor behind the rise in Treasury yields.

more prominent, yields resumed their climb following stronger-than-expected euro-area
inflation data and comments by ECB President Draghi suggesting that the ECB was
willing to tolerate some of the recent volatility in yields. On net, sovereign bond yields
are up 79 basis points in Germany since the April FOMC meeting. Some of the move
reflects higher expected policy rates; the market-implied policy rate for the euro area
three years ahead increased 35 basis points. However, most of the move is attributed to a
rise in the term premium, which appears to be a partial correction of an earlier decline.
Foreign yields also rose, along with U.S. Treasury yields, following the release of the
U.S. labor market data in June and are 15 basis points higher, on net, in Japan and
40 basis points higher in the United Kingdom.
Early in the period, peripheral sovereign spreads narrowed, reflecting a somewhat
improved outlook for Greek program negotiations. Subsequently, spreads widened after
Greek officials announced they would postpone several debt repayments to the IMF until
June 30. On net, spreads for Italy and Spain rose slightly, whereas Greek spreads
declined. Nonetheless, continuing difficulties in program negotiations have raised
concerns that the Greek government may miss this June 30 payment, and that the ECB
could curtail liquidity support to Greek banks (for more details, see the International
Economic Developments and Outlook section).
After falling during the first couple of weeks of the period, the foreign exchange s
t
n
e
(FX) value of the dollar began rising again in mid-May, reflecting higher-than-expected m
p
CPI data for April, the strong May employment report, and perhaps some step-up in o
l
e
market concerns over Greece. On net over the period, the dollar gained against most v
e
D
currencies, with the broad dollar index up 1½ percent. However, the dollar declined
l
a
i
slightly, on balance, against the euro, which may have reflected the solid incoming data c
n
a
for the euro area and the especially pronounced increase in euro-area yields. n
i
F
Against the backdrop of rising yields, equity prices in the advanced foreign
economies generally moved lower over the period. Stock prices in Canada and Europe
declined 4 to 6 percent, with the Canadian market reacting in part to the release of
disappointing data for employment in April and GDP in the first quarter. EME equity
prices declined substantially, as macroeconomic data in several EMEs came in weaker
than had been expected and as global yields moved up sharply.

CORPORATE ASSET PRICES
Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. equity price indexes moved down a bit,
on net, amid mixed macroeconomic news and little earnings news. Option-implied
volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon—the VIX—edged up, on
balance, but remained near the lower end of its historical range. Yield spreads on
corporate bonds stayed near their historical median levels outside of recessions. Spreads
on 10-year triple-B-rated corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities
widened somewhat, on balance, while spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds
narrowed slightly.
BUSINESS FINANCE
In April and May, financing conditions for large nonfinancial businesses
continued to be accommodative. Firms raised a substantial volume of funds in debt
markets, particularly for the refinancing of existing debt and the funding of M&A
activity. Gross corporate bond issuance remained quite strong, and institutional
leveraged loan issuance picked up significantly. The growth of C&I loans on banks’
balance sheets also continued to be solid. Meanwhile, financing conditions for small
businesses continued to improve, though the growth of small business loans on banks’
books remained subdued, reflecting in part still-tepid demand for credit from small

HOUSEHOLD FINANCE

intermeeting period. Nevertheless, credit remained tight for borrowers with lower credit
scores. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased 37 basis points, in line
with MBS yields and other longer-term rates.

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally
accommodative in March and April. Outstanding balances of auto and student loans
expanded further at a robust pace through April, as such credit continued to be widely
available, including to borrowers with subprime credit scores. Revolving credit picked
up in March and April after a slow start at the beginning of the year. However, overall,
revolving credit lending continued to be tight for borrowers with less-than-pristine credit
records: In the first quarter, the distribution of credit scores on new revolving accounts
moved sideways, offered credit card interest rates continued to trend up, and credit card
limits per capita for nonprime borrowers remained mostly flat at subdued levels.
The credit quality of consumer loans remained mixed on balance. Delinquency
rates on credit card loans continued to decline from already low levels, those on student
loans moderated somewhat but remained elevated, and those on auto loans remained
low. In contrast, delinquency rates on recently originated subprime auto loans continued
to edge up, likely reflecting the expansion of lending and easing of standards to such
borrowers.

loan growth was partially offset by a resurgence in consumer lending. Meanwhile, the

Why Are Net Interest Margins of Large Banks So Compressed?
The extraordinarily low interest rate environment that has prevailed in the wake of the financial
crisis has put downward pressure on the net interest margins (NIMs) of all bank holding
companies (banks), but especially the largest ones. In particular, over roughly the past five years,
NIMs of large banks have fallen about 80 basis points, while NIMs of small banks have decreased
approximately 20 basis points (left panel).1
The more pronounced decline in NIMs at large banks is driven by two main factors related to the
low interest rate environment. The first factor accounts for the majority of the difference in the
behavior of NIMs at the two bank groups and arises from the liability side of banks’ balance
sheets, namely from a more pronounced decline in deposit costs at small banks. In general,
deposit rates tend to move with short-term interest rates and are typically lower at large banks.
With the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound since late 2008, the degree to which large
banks have been able to boost their profitability by reducing their deposit rates has been more
limited relative to small banks. For example, the arithmetic effect of the decline in deposit rates
at small banks has pushed up NIMs about 60 basis points, while the corresponding effect of
declining rates at large banks has increased NIMs roughly 20 basis points (red portions of the
bars, right panel). So far, at least, large domestic banks have been reluctant to charge negative
deposit rates, a step that banks in foreign jurisdictions have been more willing to take.2
The second factor stems from the asset side of the balance sheet: Large banks have experienced
a somewhat bigger decline in the interest income they earn on “other” assets, which includes
assets held for trading purposes. Interest income on such assets has declined notably since 2010,
and large banks hold more of these assets relative to small banks. This factor explains why
interest income fell about 150 basis points at large banks while it moved down roughly 130 basis
points at small banks (gray portions of the bars, right panel).
These empirical findings have implications for assessing the monetary transmission mechanism
around the time of liftoff.3 At that time, for example, large banks could try to boost their
profitability in the short term by delaying the increase in deposit rates relative to previous s
t
n
tightening cycles. If that happens, more deposits than usual could leave the banking system,
e
m
putting some downward pressure on the level of short-term interest rates. However, with
p
interest on excess reserves higher than many deposit rates, banks may act to preserve this o
l
funding source, accelerating the pass-through to market interest rates relative to previous e
v
tightening cycles. That said, this latter effect may be damped because many large banks face e
D
balance sheet constraints in light of the new regulatory environment.

M2 expanded at an average annual rate of roughly 4½ percent over April and
May. Growth in liquid deposits and currency slowed somewhat from the rates observed
in the first quarter of 2015, bringing overall M2 growth more in line with the pace that
would be expected based on fundamentals. Small time deposits and retail money market
funds continued to run off. The monetary base contracted slightly, on net, as term
deposits and the Treasury’s General Account balance increased.1
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Testing of the ON RRP operations continued over the intermeeting period. Daily
take-up averaged about $105 billion, with money funds accounting for the majority of
participation.2
Overall, the ON RRP operations continued to provide a soft floor on money
market rates during the intermeeting period. Overnight federal funds and Eurodollar
rates stayed above the ON RRP rate, although both rates fell several basis points on the
April and May month-ends.3 The overnight triparty repo rate for Treasury collateral
averaged 7 basis points. The overnight GCF repo rate continued to be above the

Market Segmentation in the Treasury Repo Market
Since late 2014, the spread between the overnight Treasury general collateral
repo rate observed in the interdealer GCF market and general Treasury triparty
repo rate has widened (see the figure on the following page). 1 Here we discuss
the segmentation between these two markets, recent regulatory changes that
have led to the spread widening, and quarter‐end dynamics. The behavior of this
spread provides evidence that new bank regulations could be having an effect on
money markets and highlights that these changes may differentially affect
various aspects of markets for similar money market instruments.
Analysis of supervisory data collected from the two major clearing banks
suggests that the GCF rate is higher than the general triparty rate due to market
segmentation; this results from differences in counterparty credit quality, which
limits the markets in which some participants can borrow. Specifically, some
small dealers with low or no credit rating predominantly use the GCF market to
borrow Treasury repo in the triparty market. In contrast, large dealers with high
credit ratings tend to supply funds to the GCF market and are the primary
borrowers in the general triparty market, so they can earn the spread between
rates in the GCF and general triparty markets.
While this segmentation has been present for some time, recent regulatory
changes may have contributed to a widening of the rate spread. For example,
market participants have commented on the reduced attractiveness for large
dealers to intermediate repos as the Basel III leverage ratio reportedly provides a
disincentive to engage in low‐yield, balance‐sheet‐intensive activities. This
regulatory shift has likely contributed to decreasing repo volumes since 2013.
s
t
n The combination of reduced supply from large dealers and stable demand from
e
m dealers that depend on the GCF market for funding has contributed to the recent
p
widening of the spread.
o
e
l
v
e This segmentation and widening of the spread becomes particularly noticeable
D
on quarter‐ends. Specifically, there have been sharp increases in GCF market
l
a
i rates on recent quarter‐ends, especially the December 2014 and March 2015
c
n quarter‐ends, as U.S. primary dealers reduce their net GCF lending on those dates
a
n relative to the rest of the year (see the table on the following page). At the same
i
F
time, nonprimary dealers, many of which rely on the GCF market for funding,
increase their net borrowing and represent a larger share of overall borrowing.2
This increase in borrowing may be in response to a contraction in GCF‐dependent
dealers’ alternative funding options on these dates and provides further
evidence of GCF‐dependent dealers’ need to use the GCF market for funding
even at higher rates.
1 The General Collateral Finance (GCF) repo market is an interdealer market
within the overall triparty repo market. It is blind‐brokered with a central
counterparty, which reduces counterparty risk, making it an attractive funding
market for less creditworthy borrowers.
2 Foreign primary dealers borrow less on net, which could put downward
pressure on rates. However, it appears not to be the dominant effect.

Overall, the widening of the spread between the overnight Treasury GCF repo

TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING
Various liquidity metrics for Treasury and MBS markets were little changed over
the intermeeting period, and they have generally pointed to relatively stable market
functioning over the past several years.4 However, the majority of the June SCOOS
respondents indicated that, over the past five years, liquidity and functioning in these
markets, especially in Treasury markets, have deteriorated. Respondents attributed the
deterioration primarily to securities dealers’ decreased willingness to provide balance
sheet resources for marketmaking purposes as a result of both regulatory changes and
changes in internal risk-management practices.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). However, we continue to view the risks to our forecast
for real GDP growth as tilted somewhat to the downside. Importantly, neither monetary
nor fiscal policy appears well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.
By contrast, we continue to view the risks around our unemployment projection as
roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse demand-side
developments roughly offset by the possibility that the surprisingly steep declines in the
unemployment rate of recent years will continue.
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. At the same time, we
continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.
Despite some recent increases, TIPS-based inflation compensation remains well below its
level of a year ago and core PCE price inflation remains below the Committee’s target
despite a declining unemployment rate and other signs of labor market tightening. One
factor that has likely held down U.S. inflation recently has been the increase in the
exchange value of the dollar. With other major central banks conducting aggressive
policies to fight their own inflation shortfalls, the dollar may be stronger than in the
baseline, leading to continued downward pressure on U.S. inflation.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly

elevated. Structural vulnerabilities in the mutual fund sector persist, particularly for U.S.
money market funds and funds that invest in illiquid assets. And bond market liquidity is
reported by some market participants to be more likely to dissipate in the presence of
market stress than has historically been the case.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first
scenario, aggregate demand is persistently weaker than in the baseline, such that the long-
run equilibrium real interest rate is lower. The second scenario also features weaker
aggregate demand than in the baseline; in this case, however, the weakening is more
pronounced in the near term but is of shorter duration. The third scenario considers the
possibility that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than in the baseline. In the
fourth, recent softness in the incoming data proves to be more transitory—a nd the
underlying pace of economic activity stronger—t han assumed in the baseline projection,
leading to a higher path of inflation. In the fifth scenario, foreign economic growth is
significantly weaker than in our baseline outlook, while the dollar appreciates markedly.
In the final scenario, a disorderly exit of Greece from the euro-area monetary union
causes Europe to plunge into a deep recession with severe adverse effects on global
financial conditions and confidence.
We generate the first, second, and third scenarios using the FRB/US model, while
the fourth one uses the EDO model. The final two scenarios are generated using the
multicountry SIGMA model. Once the federal funds rate has risen above its current
target range, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast—b y an inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule. The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a
mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the
Committee’s recent statements.1 In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of
the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.

Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate
Thus far in the recovery, aggregate demand has been weak, likely reflecting both
domestic and global factors. In the baseline, these factors are expected to dissipate, so
the equilibrium real federal funds rate is assumed to rise over time. However, some have
argued that the factors that have depressed aggregate demand are essentially permanent;
accordingly, in this scenario, we assume that the current weakness in aggregate demand
continues such that the equilibrium real federal funds rate rises 1 percentage point less
over the next decade than in the baseline. We assume that policymakers immediately
recognize the lower trajectory of the equilibrium interest rate.
As a result of the lower level of aggregate demand, output expands more slowly
than in the baseline until the end of 2017. However, monetary policy is able to offset a
significant portion of the shortfall, and real GDP growth in 2016 is just ¼ percentage
point lower than in the baseline. The path for the unemployment rate is slightly higher
than in the baseline. Because the lower value for the long-run equilibrium federal funds
rate is known from the start of the simulation, it affects the setting of monetary policy in
the near term, and the initial increase in the federal funds rate is delayed until the first
quarter of 2016. Thereafter, the difference between the alternative and the baseline
widens, and by 2018, the federal funds rate is 1 percentage point lower than in the
baseline.
Near-Term Slowdown in Economic Activity
In the first scenario, the weakness in aggregate demand is assumed to be
permanent but modest in magnitude. In this scenario, we assume that the softness in
aggregate demand turns out to be less persistent, but much sharper, than in the first
scenario. Relative to the baseline, the projected acceleration in consumer demand and
housing construction falters. The resulting weaker economy adversely affects profits and
business confidence, causing firms to reduce their investment spending.
Real GDP rises only ½ percent in 2016. In 2017, real GDP grows 1½ percent,
½ percentage point less than the baseline. The unemployment rate rises to 6¾ percent at
y
t
the end of 2017 before gradually moving back toward its assumed natural rate. The path n
i
a
t
for inflation is lower than in the baseline projection. Given this weaker outlook, liftoff is r
e
c
delayed until the first quarter of 2016 and the federal funds rate remains at or below n
U
50 basis points until early 2018. The federal funds rate reaches 1½ percent by the end of &

Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment
While the unemployment rate has come down substantially over the past few
years, inflation has not picked up, with core PCE inflation averaging less than 1½ percent
since 2012. One reason inflation has remained subdued despite falling unemployment
may be that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than generally thought. A lower
trajectory for the natural rate would also help reconcile the rapid decrease in
unemployment seen in recent years with the modest increases in GDP. In this scenario,
we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has fallen faster over the past five years
than assumed by the staff, to 4.2 percent in the current quarter, 1 percentage point less
than in the baseline.
The higher level of potential output in this scenario implies that the output gap is
initially wider than in the baseline and that the first increase in the federal funds rate is
delayed until the last quarter of 2015. As a result of more-accommodative monetary
policy, real GDP growth picks up, averaging about 2¼ percent over the 2015– 19 period,
about 15 basis points higher than in the baseline. The unemployment rate declines faster
than in the baseline and does not approach its natural rate until the end of 2019. Given
that the Phillips curve is very flat, the path for inflation is essentially unchanged.
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation
While some incoming data have been soft, other indicators have been more
encouraging. Real GDI rose 1½ percent in the first quarter, auto sales surged in May, and
some indicators of residential investment have been more positive. Job openings are
elevated, and initial claims for unemployment insurance are at historical lows. In this
scenario, households and businesses are more confident about the underlying strength of
the economy, and that greater confidence leads them to be more willing to spend and hire
than in the baseline, supporting a much faster economic expansion. We also assume that
inflation is more sensitive to reductions in resource slack than in the standard version of
the EDO model, consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE models.2
Real GDP growth averages about 3¼ percent in the second half of 2015 and
y
t
n 4 percent in 2016, compared with 2 percent and 2½ percent, respectively, in the baseline
i
a

2 We make inflation more sensitive to slack by reducing the adjustment cost parameters for prices

4½ percent at the beginning of 2017, and then increases slowly for the remainder of the
forecast period. With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the
baseline, reaching 2¼ percent by the end of 2017. The federal funds rate lifts off at the
same time as in the baseline but rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in 2018
and approaching 5 percent by the end of 2019. Given enough time, this path for the
federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed
natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent.
Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar
In our baseline forecast, we project that foreign output growth will pick up
noticeably from its languid pace over the past two years, especially in the EMEs, and that
this pickup in foreign growth will contribute to a modest depreciation of the broad real
dollar in 2016 and 2017. However, foreign growth may continue to disappoint for a
number of reasons: China could experience a more pronounced slowdown than in our
baseline if the property market weakens further and lending conditions tighten; growth in
EME exports and investment spending may remain subdued rather than bounce back as
in our baseline; or the BOJ’s and ECB’s large-scale quantitative easing programs may
fail to deliver much of a boost to output and inflation. In this scenario, we assume that a
weakening of household and business confidence abroad and a modest tightening of
credit conditions cause foreign GDP growth to run 1 percentage point below the baseline
over the forecast period, with the negative growth surprises somewhat more concentrated
in the EMEs. Given the heightened divergence between monetary policy abroad and in
the United States, the gradual removal of policy accommodation in the United States is
assumed to generate substantial flows toward dollar-denominated assets, causing the
broad real dollar to appreciate 7 percent relative to baseline.
The slower foreign growth and stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall
relative to the baseline. All told, U.S. real GDP expands by less than 2 percent in 2016,
about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate remains
above 5½ percent until 2019. Weaker U.S. economic activity and lower import price
inflation hold core inflation to about 1¼ percent through 2016. The federal funds rate

lifts off at the same time as in the baseline, but U.S. monetary policy removes
accommodation more gradually going forward.3
Greek Exit with Severe Spillovers
Our baseline assumption is that spillovers from developments in Greece will be
contained, even in the event that debt negotiations break down completely and Greece’s
crisis deepens. However, it is far from assured that the firewalls erected during the past
few years and actions that the authorities would presumably take to limit contagion will
succeed, especially if Greece actually leaves the euro area. In this scenario, we consider
a direr outcome in which Greece abandons the euro and the related disruptions cause the
euro area to plunge into a deep recession, with severe adverse effects on global financial
conditions and confidence.
Specifically, our scenario assumes that financial conditions in the euro area
tighten sharply and that confidence plummets amid rising unemployment and heightened
disinflationary pressures. Peripheral sovereign spreads rise 400 basis points above
baseline, while euro-area corporate borrowing spreads rise more than 200 basis points.
As a result, euro-area real GDP falls about 6 percent relative to the baseline by early
2017. The euro-area crisis has substantial adverse spillovers to the United States. U.S.
corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 100 basis points, while flight-to-safety
flows help push the trade-weighted dollar up nearly 8 percent and depress 10-year
Treasury yields about 25 basis points.
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall
relative to the baseline. U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the baseline as a
result of lower confidence and tighter credit conditions, and U.S. real GDP nearly stalls
in the second half of 2015 and expands only ¾ percent in 2016. Lower domestic demand
and lower import price inflation cause U.S. core inflation to run at ¾ percent in 2016,
about 1 percentage point below baseline. The inertial Taylor rule prescribes a
substantially shallower path for the federal funds rate than in the baseline.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that y
t
n
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time. a i

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
