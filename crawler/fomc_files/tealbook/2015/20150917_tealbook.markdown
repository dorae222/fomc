Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

v
e
The incoming information on real activity has been stronger, on net, than we D
n
expected in the July Tealbook. Real GDP is now estimated to have increased at an o
c
E
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of the year, 1 percentage point faster than in our
c
i
t
July projection, and we continue to expect that aggregate output will rise at a 2 percent s
e
m
pace in the second half. Moreover, we view labor market conditions as having improved o
D
by more than we anticipated: The unemployment rate moved down to 5.1 percent in
August, 0.2 percentage point below our previous projection and equal to our estimate of
its natural rate. Payroll gains are reported to have averaged 220,000 per month from June
through August.
In contrast, the key background factors shaping our medium-term forecast have
become somewhat less supportive of economic growth since the time of the July
Tealbook, as equity prices have declined, the dollar has appreciated further, and prospects
for foreign economic growth have weakened. Accordingly, real GDP is now projected to
increase 2 percent in both 2016 and 2017 and then ease to a 1¾ percent pace in 2018,
nearly ¼ percentage point lower per year, on average, than in the previous Tealbook. By
the end of 2017, the slower projected pace of output growth unwinds the upward surprise
to GDP growth in the first half of 2015.
Even with the upward revision to GDP growth in the first half of this year, the
unemployment rate has moved down more than could be explained by our usual Okun’s
law relationship given the supply assumptions that we had in place in the July
Tealbook. Accordingly, we made several adjustments to allow a little greater downward
tilt in our projection for the unemployment rate. In particular, we further degraded our
assumptions about potential output growth and prevented our forecast of GDP growth
from weakening over the medium term as much as the deterioration of the key
background factors otherwise would have indicated. As a result, we now project the
unemployment rate will fall more in line with the improvement in the GDP gap over the
next few years, reaching 4.8 percent by the end of 2017, 0.3 percentage point below our
estimate of its natural rate. At that time, actual GDP is expected to exceed its potential
by ¾ percent. By contrast, we had previously expected output to equal its potential in the
final quarter of 2017.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v
e The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following the
D
June FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection with the
n
o one we presented in the June Tealbook.
c
E
c
i Since the June projection, we have revised up our forecast for real GDP growth this year, as
t
s
e stronger‐than‐expected data for the first half of the year more than offsets our slightly weaker
m
o projection for the second half. Our forecast of real GDP growth for 2016 through 2018 is a little
D
slower than in June, mostly because our projected path for the foreign exchange value of the
dollar is higher and the path for equity prices is lower. We also have reduced somewhat our
trajectory for potential GDP over the medium term. Altogether, these revisions leave our
projection for the GDP gap over the projection period stronger than in the June forecast. The
unemployment rate has declined more than we expected in June and is projected to average
5.0 percent in the fourth quarter of this year. The unemployment rate is forecast to gradually
decline to 4.7 percent at the end of 2018, below the staff’s estimate of its natural rate—which is a
bit lower than in the June forecast.
The staff’s projection for headline PCE inflation has been revised down in the second half of this
year, largely reflecting declines in crude oil prices that are expected to pass through to consumer
energy prices; core PCE inflation is expected to be a little softer than in the June projection, as the
prices of core imported goods are anticipated to decline at a faster pace than in June with the
further appreciation of the dollar. Given our assumptions that longer‐run inflation expectations

will remain stable over the medium term, the declines in energy prices will be transitory, and core O
import prices will start to rise by the middle of next year, our forecasts for headline and core &

inflation in 2016 through 2018 are little changed. We continue to project that inflation will run e

e
somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective through 2018. D
n
o
We maintained our assumption that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower c
E
bound in the third quarter of this year, but we adjusted down our assumptions about long‐run c
i
t
equilibrium interest rates. Specifically, we lowered our assumed longer‐run nominal value of the s
e
federal funds rate ¼ percentage point, to 3¼ percent. Even with the downward revision to our m
o
assumption for longer‐run equilibrium interest rates, the stronger GDP gap in the current forecast, D
along with an inflation projection that is little changed, leaves the projected path for the federal
funds rate a little above the one in the June forecast—around 0.2 percentage point higher at the
end of next year and in 2018.
Because FOMC participants are providing additional information about their expectations of the
economic conditions that will exist at the time they anticipate it will first become appropriate to
increase the target range for the federal funds rate, we include the table below providing quarterly
information from the staff projection. In the third quarter of this year—the quarter when our
baseline projection assumes liftoff of the federal funds rate will occur—we forecast the
unemployment rate to average 5.2 percent and the trailing four‐quarter change in real GDP to be
2.1 percent. We project the trailing four‐quarter change in core PCE inflation to be 1.3 percent, and
the four‐quarter change in headline PCE prices to be only 0.2 percent because of decreases in
energy prices over the past year.

The main news in our inflation projection pertains to the decline in commodity u t
O
prices and appreciation of the dollar since the July Tealbook; these factors impart a little
&
greater restraint on consumer price inflation in the near term. Otherwise, our outlook for e l
v
e
price inflation is little revised from the July Tealbook. We have core inflation gradually D
n
moving up from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2018, as import prices turn back o
c
E
up, the effects of earlier sharp declines in energy prices wane, and resource utilization
c
i
t
tightens. Total PCE price inflation is expected to run roughly in line with core inflation s
e
m
beyond the near term. The incoming data on compensation has generally been a good bit o
D
softer than expected and suggests that wages have continued to rise at the same modest
pace we have seen over the past several years.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its
effective lower bound after the September meeting, and that it will be
governed thereafter by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.1
However, we lowered our assumption for the longer-run real federal funds
rate by 25 basis points.2 Even so, the projected path of the federal funds rate
1 If we had instead assumed that the federal funds rate would lift off after the December meeting
and be governed (as in the baseline) by the inertial Taylor rule thereafter, the FRB/US model projects that,
relative to our current forecast, the level of real GDP would be 0.1 percent higher at the end of 2018, the
unemployment rate would be less than 0.1 percentage point lower at the end of 2018, core consumer
inflation would be 1 basis point higher in 2018, and the federal funds rate would be 5 basis points higher at
the end of the medium term.
2 In this Tealbook, we lowered our assumption for the longer-run nominal value of the federal
funds rate and the 10-year Treasury yield by ¼ percentage point each, to 3¼ percent and 4 percent,
respectively. Because inflation in the longer run remains unchanged at the Committee’s objective of
2 percent, these reductions in nominal interest rates reflect a reduction in long-run equilibrium real interest
rates. These adjustments were motivated partly by the decline in far-forward interest rates. For example,
5- and 10-year forward rates on 10-year Treasury notes are 60 basis points lower than a year ago; we had
previously adjusted down our assessment of the longer-run real federal funds rate by only 25 basis points.
Even with the latest adjustment, our estimate of the real longer-run funds rate (1¼ percent) remains well
above the point value that comes out of the model by Laubach and Williams (2005)—see
www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john-williams for current estimates—and slightly above the
midpoint of the range cited in Hamilton and others (see James Hamilton, Ethan Harris, Jan Hatzius, and
Kenneth West (2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present and Future,” unpublished paper).
For a broad description of factors influencing the trend in interest rates over recent decades, see Long-Term
Interest Rates: A Survey (2015), a report by the Executive Office of the President of the United States,
accessible via a link in a July 14, 2015, blog post, “The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates,” by Maurice

u t is steeper than in the July Tealbook, as the upward impetus from tighter
O
resource utilization in this projection more than offsets the decrease in the
&
e l longer-run real federal funds rate. All told, the nominal federal funds rate is
v
e
D projected to reach an average of 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018,
n
o 0.3 percentage point higher than in the July projection.
c
E
c
t i  The SOMA portfolio is assumed to remain at its current size until about two
s
e
m quarters after the federal funds rate is raised above its effective lower bound,
o
D
at which point the portfolio begins to contract as maturing assets are not
reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise
significantly, reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well as an
increase in the term premium toward its historically normal level. Compared
with the July Tealbook, the rise in the Treasury yield is a bit steeper, as the
path of expected short-term rates over the valuation window is higher.
 We revised up the path for the 30-year mortgage rate and the 10-year triple-B
corporate yield about in line with the revision to Treasury yields.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 After dropping around 7 percent, on net, since the July Tealbook, equity
prices are expected to rise roughly 4 percent per year over the projection
period, somewhat faster than in the July Tealbook. Even so, the level of
equity prices at the end of 2018 is 3½ percent lower in this projection than in
the July Tealbook. Thus, we judge that the considerations that have pushed
equity valuations downward since July will prove partly transitory and partly
persistent.
 The data on house prices have come in a bit stronger than we had anticipated,
and we now expect house prices to increase 6¼ percent in 2015; thereafter, we
continue to expect house prices to rise 3 percent per year. Our assessment is

that house prices are not far out of line with their historical relationship to u t

rents, and we expect valuations to remain within the range predicted by this
&
relationship over the medium term. e l
v
e
D
Fiscal Policy n
o
c
E
 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.
c
i
t
We continue to anticipate that, after having been a small drag on real GDP s
e
m
growth in 2014, fiscal policy actions at all levels of government will provide a o
D
small stimulus in 2015 and over the medium term.
 The federal government faces multiple fiscal deadlines over the remainder of
the year. The main items requiring action are that spending legislation must
be enacted by October 1 or the government will shut down, and the federal
debt limit is expected to bind sometime in the fourth quarter. We assume
these deadlines will be navigated such that there are no significant disruptions
to government operations or financial markets.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign real GDP now is estimated to have expanded at an annual rate of only
about 1 percent in the second quarter of this year, ½ percentage point below
our projection in the July Tealbook. In addition, we marked down our
projection for growth in the second half by about ½ percentage point, to a
2¼ percent pace; this downward adjustment reflects weakness in recent
indicators, most notably for China, as well as the financial turbulence
associated in part with concerns about the Chinese economy. We continue to
expect foreign growth to pick up and average about 3 percent between now
and the end of 2018. The advanced foreign economies should continue to
recover, importantly supported by accommodative monetary policy; in turn,
the emerging market economies should be helped by a rebound in exports to
the advanced foreign economies and the United States. Nevertheless, this
projection is slightly weaker than in the previous Tealbook, mainly because
we lowered our medium-term projection for China’s economic growth rate by
½ percentage point, and that reassessment spills over into lower projected
growth in other foreign economies, especially those in emerging Asia.

 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated 2¼ percent on net since the time of
O
& the July Tealbook. The dollar rose against most emerging market currencies,
l
e notably including the Chinese renminbi, but fell against the euro and the yen.
v
e
D We expect the nominal dollar to rise a bit further through the end of this year,
n
o pushed up by monetary policy actions in the United States, some further rise
c
E
against the renminbi, and by concerns about the global outlook, and then to be
c
i
t
s little changed on net over the remainder of the medium term. This trajectory
e
m
o is above our previous forecast and leaves the broad real dollar about 4 percent
D
higher at the end of the forecast period than in the July Tealbook.
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices
 After a month of dramatic price swings, the spot price of Brent crude oil is
about $8 per barrel lower relative to the time of the July Tealbook. Prices for
futures contracts with delivery at the end of 2018 are down about $6 per
barrel. These declines appear to primarily reflect anxieties about the prospects
for global demand, especially in China, against a backdrop of continued
strength in global oil production. As the recent declines in spot crude prices
pass through to import prices, we expect the price of imported oil to move
down from $51 per barrel this quarter to $46 per barrel next quarter.
Thereafter, we forecast that the price of imported oil will move up slowly to
about $54 per barrel by the end of 2018, in line with quotes from futures
markets.
 Concerns about weak global demand have also weighed on metals prices, with
an index of these prices falling about 5 percent since the previous Tealbook.
Agricultural prices edged down over this period, largely in response to
positive supply-side developments.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
As noted earlier, the most recent information suggests that growth in aggregate
output in the first half of this year was more robust than we had projected in July.3 We
now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 2¼ percent over that period,
3 The upward revision to real GDP in the first half of this year was primarily due to stronger-than-
projected construction spending in both the private and public sectors, a faster-than-expected pace of
inventory accumulation, and a smaller-than-expected drag from net exports.

l
1 percentage point more than we thought previously. We continue to expect aggregate u t
O
output to rise at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second half of the year, a pace of
&
growth sufficient to further narrow the remaining gap between actual and potential e l
v
e
output.4 D
n
o
c
 After having averaged 2½ percent in the first half of the year, real PCE growth E
c
i
is projected to average 2¾ percent in the second half, supported by moderate t
s
e
m
growth in real disposable personal income, upbeat consumer sentiment, and a
o
D
wealth-to-income ratio that remains high even after the recent fall in the stock
market. That said, the lower equity prices and a more muted trajectory of
labor income led us to lower our projection for real PCE growth in the latter
part of this year.
 Overall investment spending is projected to rise at a moderate pace over the
second half of this year. Recent data on housing starts and sales suggest that
residential investment remains on a gradual upward trend. In the business
sector, we anticipate that the earlier sharp decline of investment in oil and
drilling structures will ease substantially this quarter and next, and that
investment elsewhere will proceed at a rate consistent with the projected
modest pace of sales growth. In all, private fixed investment is projected to
rise at an annual rate of 4¾ percent in the second half; this projection is a little
stronger than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the more positive tone of the
incoming data across a range of categories, including nonresidential
construction and investment in equipment and intangibles.
 Net exports, which subtracted almost 1 percentage point from GDP growth in
the first half of the year, are projected to take ¾ percentage point off growth in
the second half. This projection is slightly less negative than in the July
Tealbook, as better-than-expected trade data from July is mostly offset by the
negative impetus from the higher dollar and weaker foreign growth.
 The direct and upstream effects of lower oil and gas prices and the
appreciation in the dollar are also expected to continue to restrain oil drilling
activity and to damp demand for factory output. As a result, industrial
4 As noted in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” the
staff’s judgmental projection for real GDP growth for the third quarter, at 2 percent, is about equal to the
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System.

production, which fell at an annual rate of 1¼ percent in the first half of the u t

D
modestly above our estimate of potential growth, supported by monetary policy that
remains accommodative, albeit decreasingly so.
 Compared with the July Tealbook, aggregate output growth is, on average,
nearly ¼ percentage point lower per year over the medium term. The
downward revision reflects the higher path for the dollar, the lower path for
equity prices, and the more subdued outlook for foreign output growth.
 We expect above-trend growth in aggregate demand to be led by further gains
in consumer spending, as continued improvements in labor market conditions
support additional increases in real personal income and consumer confidence.
 We continue to assess the current level of residential construction as
unsustainably low. We therefore project a significant increase in starts over
the medium term supported by the strengthening job market, low mortgage
rates, and our expectation that household formation will move up from its
currently low level.
 Government purchases are expected to rise only sluggishly over the medium
term at a pace well below that seen in past economic expansions. Although
we expect state and local governments to increase their purchases moderately
as the expansion in economic activity continues to push up their tax
collections, purchases at the federal level are expected to drift lower because
of both continued adherence to sequestration spending levels and the
drawdown of spending on overseas military operations.

u t THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
O
&
Taken together, the two employment reports that we have received since the July
l
e
v
e Tealbook were more positive, on net, than we had expected.
D
n
o
c  Total nonfarm payrolls are reported by the BLS to have risen an average of
E
c
i 220,000 over the three months ending in August, in line with our July
t
s
e
m Tealbook projection. However, we think the odds are that subsequent
o
D estimates will show a somewhat larger gain in August than is currently
reported.5
 The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in August, 0.2 percentage point
below our July Tealbook projection. However, the participation rate also
came in lower than we had projected, leaving the employment-to-population
ratio in line with our previous forecast.
 Looking ahead, we continue to expect payroll employment to rise at an
average monthly pace of 205,000 in the fourth quarter. We expect the
unemployment rate to edge down to 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter,
0.2 percentage point lower than in our previous projection.
Even with the upward revision to real GDP growth in the first half of this year,
the sizable downward surprise in the unemployment rate in August left the tension
between the unemployment rate gap and the output gap uncomfortably large.
Accordingly, to bring the two gaps into better alignment at present and allow for a steeper
decline in our medium-term forecast for the unemployment rate, we took steps to widen
the differential between actual and potential output growth, all else being equal.
 On the potential output side of the equation, we took a little signal from the
disappointing news about productivity implied by the NIPA annual revision
5 In 10 of the past 12 years, the first estimate of the change in August payroll employment has
been revised up, and we expect another upward revision, of about 60,000, to occur this year. As a matter of
internal housekeeping, we have lumped the expected upward revision to August employment in with the
anticipated September gain.

The medium-term outlook for labor market utilization is stronger, on net, than in

of 2018.
 Monthly payroll gains are projected to slow gradually from 215,000 in 2015
to 105,000 in 2018, as the level of productivity moves back toward its
structural trend.
 Although the unemployment rate in August was at our estimate of its natural
rate, we believe that a small amount of slack—but less than in previous
Tealbooks—remains in the labor market. This judgment reflects our view
that the labor force participation rate is still unusually low relative to its trend
6 The BEA’s annual revision to real GDP, published at the end of July, put the level of real GDP in
the final quarter of 2014 nearly 1 percent lower than in the previous vintage of NIPA data. Consistent with
our usual practice, we adjusted our estimates of potential output in line with the revisions to actual GDP.
This downward revision in potential output growth manifests in slower trend productivity growth than we
had previously assumed.

quarter of this year and thereafter relative to the July Tealbook.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION E
c
i
t
s
Total PCE prices are expected to rise at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the e
m
o
current quarter and then to fall 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter. The projected decline in
D
the headline price index at the end of this year largely reflects the pass-through of the
drop in crude oil prices this summer into consumer energy prices and the narrowing of
temporarily elevated gasoline margins. Core PCE price inflation is projected to step
down from 1.8 percent in the second quarter to 1.2 percent in the second half of the year,
reflecting further declines in core import prices, some pass-through into core prices of the
earlier steep declines in energy prices, and a continuation of some tendency for core
inflation to run a little high in the second quarter and then a little low in the second half
of the year (a manifestation of residual seasonality).
 Our forecast for fourth-quarter headline PCE inflation is ½ percentage point
lower than in our previous projection, largely due to the downward surprise in
crude oil prices since the July Tealbook.
 We expect core import prices to fall at an annual rate of about 1¾ percent over
the second half of 2015 and decrease 1 percent in the first quarter of 2016.
Relative to the July Tealbook, this forecast has been revised down
1¼ percentage points, on average, in these three quarters because of recent
dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices.
 The projection for core PCE inflation in the second half of this year is
0.2 percentage point lower than in the July Tealbook, reflecting slightly
softer-than-expected incoming data and the downward adjustment to our
near-term path for core import prices.
 The gap between core CPI and core PCE inflation has been unusually wide
recently. For further discussion, see the box “The Recent Gap between Core
CPI and Core PCE Price Inflation Measures.”

The Recent Gap between Core CPI and Core PCE Price Inflation Measures
&
l
e
v
e Headline measures of consumer prices provide the best metric for changes in the cost of living, but
D
core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, tends to be more useful when trying
n
o to distinguish the inflation signal from the transitory noise. However, different core measures can
c
E provide conflicting signals about inflation. For example, the core CPI increased 1¾ percent over the
c
i 12 months ending in July, very similar to its pace over the preceding 12 months, while core PCE prices
t
s
e increased only 1¼ percent over the same period, a step down from the pace over the prior 12 months.
m
o As a result, the gap between the core CPI and the core PCE measures of price inflation (the black line
D
in figure 1) is currently more than ½ percentage point, notably wider than the average gap over the
past 15 years (the red line). However, as shown in figure 1, the difference between core CPI and core
PCE price inflation has varied over time, and the current gap is not unprecedented.1

The CPI and the PCE price index differ for many reasons, including different aggregation formulas,
different prices for some items, different weights used in aggregating items, and a broader scope of
coverage for the PCE index. In combination, these methodological differences cause some categories
of expenditure prices to make a notably larger or smaller contribution to CPI inflation than to PCE
price inflation. Figure 2 (next page) shows contributions of some expenditure price categories to the
gap between core CPI and core PCE price inflation over the past 12 months (the black bars) compared
with their average contribution over the past 15 years (the red bars). This chart suggests that the
recent behavior of prices for housing services and for medical services can more than explain why core
CPI inflation is currently markedly higher than core PCE price inflation.
1 In contrast to the difference in the core measures, over the 12 months ending in July, both the total CPI and total PCE
price index increased at about the same pace—¼ percent. Currently, there is no gap between the headline measures
because the recent sharp declines in energy prices have a larger effect on the CPI than on the PCE price index. On average,
the gap between the headline CPI and headline PCE price inflation has been about ⅓ percentage point over the past 15 years.
A 15‐year average is chosen as the reference period in order to allow for the use of methodologically consistent CPI
component series.

In particular, both the CPI and PCE price index for housing services increased about 3 percent over the
12 months ending in July.2 But because housing services have a much larger weight in the core CPI
than in the core PCE price index, this increase in housing services prices contributed 1¼ percentage
points to core CPI inflation over the past 12 months but only ½ percentage point to core PCE price
inflation. The ¾ percentage point difference between the two contributions (shown by the second
black bar in figure 2) is larger than the average contribution over the past 15 years (the corresponding
red bar) because housing services prices have increased more rapidly over the past year than over the
past 15 years.
Another key difference between the CPI and PCE price index is the treatment of medical services. The CPI
focuses on household out‐of‐pocket expenditures, while the PCE price index tries to capture all
household medical consumption, regardless of the payer. For example, the PCE index includes medical
services paid for by Medicare and Medicaid, which are largely excluded from the CPI.3 Consequently,
medical services have a much smaller weight in the CPI than in the PCE price index, and thus the rapidly
rising medical services prices over the past 15 years contributed less to core CPI inflation than to core PCE
price inflation (shown by the negative middle red bar in figure 2). However, a substantial slowing of
medical services price inflation (driven, in large part, by the administered Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement rates used in PCE prices) has led the contribution of total medical services to be roughly
the same for both the core CPI and the core PCE price index in the most recent 12 months (the middle
black bar in figure 2).
In the Tealbook baseline forecast, we project that the gap between core CPI and core PCE price inflation
will edge down by 2017 but will still be about ¼ percentage point above the current 15‐year average, as
relatively high housing services price inflation and low PCE medical services price inflation are anticipated
to persist for some time.
2 For this analysis, we define housing services prices as tenants’ rent and owners’ equivalent rent.
3 As a result, many of the PCE price components are based on PPI, not CPI, series.

2.7 percent—at the lower end of the narrow range of values seen in recent
years. Expected PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of
Professional Forecasters for the current quarter was 2 percent—essentially the
same as it has been for the past 2 years.
 In contrast, TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation fell
substantially amid the turbulence in financial markets and the decline in oil
prices. However, staff models attributed little of this decline in inflation
compensation to lower expected inflation.
Overall, the incoming data on compensation were weaker than our expectations in
the July Tealbook and suggest that recent wage gains have continued to be subdued.
 Average hourly earnings of all employees were up 2.2 percent in the
12 months through August, broadly in line with the increases seen over the
past several years.
 After increasing at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, the
employment cost index (ECI) for private industry workers was unchanged in
the second quarter, as the wages and salaries component of the index
decelerated and the benefits component declined. The 12-month change in the
ECI as of June was 1.9 percent, very close to the pace of the preceding 3 years
but ½ percentage point less than projected in the July Tealbook.
 The four-quarter change in hourly compensation from the Productivity and
Costs release was 2¼ percent in the second quarter, about ½ percentage point

below our previous projection. Nonetheless, with labor and product markets u t

tightening over the projection period, we expect this measure of hourly
&
compensation to step up to an average pace of around 3 percent over the e l

medium term. D

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK E
c
i
t
s
 The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an e
m
o
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. However, as in the near- and D
medium-term portions of the forecast, the policy rule now assumes a long-run
equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3¼ percent rather than
the 3½ percent used in the previous Tealbook.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.
The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a normal size by 2021.
 The federal funds rate rises further after 2018. With the economy running
above its potential level and inflation having nearly reached the Committee’s
2 percent objective, the federal funds rate moves above its long-run value in
2019 and 2020.
 The natural rate of unemployment remains at 5.1 percent, and potential GDP
rises about 1¾ percent per year, on average, in 2019 and 2020.
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates further and
rises 1.6 percent in 2020. The unemployment rate remains at 4.7 percent until
2020 and moves back up toward its assumed natural rate thereafter.
 PCE price inflation remains below the Committee’s long-run objective at the
end of 2019 but moves up to 2 percent at the end of 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign economic growth appears to have remained quite weak in the second quarter at
only 1 percent, down from an already sluggish 1½ percent in the first quarter. This second-
quarter estimate is more than ½ percentage point lower than we had forecast at the time of the
July Tealbook, with sizable downward revisions to the estimates for Brazil, Japan, and emerging
Asia. We expect growth to step up to 2¼ percent in the second half of this year, in part as
temporary factors holding down activity in Canada let up and Brazil begins to pull out of its
k
steep contraction. o
o
l
t
u
O
This second-half pace for the foreign economies is almost ½ percentage point below our
&
July forecast. Early third-quarter indicators for many economies have come in softer than l
e
v
e
expected, most notably in China. In addition, the depreciation of the renminbi, the continued D
slide in Chinese equity prices, and inconsistent responses of Chinese authorities have shaken n
o
c
global financial and commodity markets, putting a damper on global growth, especially in E
l
’
t
EMEs. The decline in oil prices since July, in part associated with concerns about weaker n
I
Chinese growth, should eventually prove to be a net positive for global growth, but in the near
term it is likely to depress activity among oil exporters more than it boosts demand in oil
importers.
Beyond the near term, we still project a further pickup in growth in the foreign
economies, to 3 percent by the second half of 2016, a bit above its trend pace. AFE growth
should continue to firm, reflecting accommodative monetary policy and a further healing in
credit markets. EME growth should be helped by a rebound in exports to the advanced
economies. Nevertheless, we revised down our outlook by ¼ percentage point next year and by
a little less thereafter. This revision reflects weaker momentum in many economies, somewhat
tighter financial conditions, and, most importantly, a markdown in longer-term prospects for the
Chinese economy, where potential growth appears to be decelerating a bit more rapidly than
previously estimated.
Moreover, as underscored by the turbulence in global financial markets, the risks to our
projection for foreign growth are skewed a little more to the downside. Financial and economic
conditions in China could deteriorate much more sharply than we have seen to date, triggering a
severe recession in the EMEs and substantial economic spillovers to the global economy. (See
the alternative scenarios on China in the Risks and Uncertainty section.) Additionally, a
Page 37 of 98

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 9, 2015
worsening of financial and economic conditions in EMEs in response to the liftoff in U.S.
interest rates remains a significant concern. Although conditions in Greece appear quiescent at
the moment, the situation there could deteriorate at any time. Finally, against the background of
repeated shortfalls in foreign growth relative to our forecast, it is possible that the trend growth
of foreign GDP is weaker than we have assumed.
Inflation rates continue to be quite low in the AFEs, and market-based measures of
inflation expectations have recently moved down in the euro area and Japan. The sharp drop in
oil prices since the previous Tealbook led us to revise down our projection for headline
k consumer price inflation by almost ½ percentage point in the second half, to ¾ percentage point.
o
o
l As the effects of lower oil prices wane and economic slack narrows, AFE inflation should move
t
u
O
up to around 1¾ percent in 2018. In the EMEs, we estimate that inflation picked up to around
&
l 3½ percent in the current quarter, partly because of higher food prices in China and currency
e
v
e depreciation in many EMEs. Inflation should move back down to around 3 percent by next year,
D
n as the effects of higher food prices wane.
o
c
E
l
’ Along with our weaker forecasts for both economic activity and inflation, we now
t
n
I
assume somewhat easier macroeconomic policy. China has already taken steps to ease financial
conditions, and several other EMEs have loosened fiscal policy or are expected to do so. We
also expect the Bank of Canada (BOC) to wait longer than we had previously assumed to begin
raising rates, and we now anticipate that the European Central Bank (ECB) will extend its asset
purchase program beyond its earlier-anticipated end date of September 2016.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. We expect real GDP growth to edge down from its average pace of
6½ percent in the first half to 6¼ percent in the current quarter. Recent data on
industrial production, exports, and PMIs all point to a significant loss of momentum
in China’s manufacturing sector. The surprise change in China’s exchange rate
policy on August 11, which resulted in a 3 percent devaluation of the renminbi,
should provide only a modest offset. We project that growth should decline further to
about 6 percent by 2018, as slower growth in the labor force and rebalancing from
manufacturing to services production contribute to a decline in potential growth.
Compared with the July Tealbook, this forecast is about 1 percentage point lower in
the third quarter. Moreover, as described in greater detail in the box “Recent
Developments in China and Their Implications for Our Forecast,” we have lowered
Page 38 of 98

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 9, 2015
Chinese growth ½ percentage point over the remainder of the forecast period. The
accumulation of weaker data led us to bring down our (admittedly uncertain) estimate
of potential growth. In addition, the authorities’ clumsy response to the stock market
crash and poorly communicated change in exchange rate policy likely hurt confidence
and raised questions about the authorities’ ability to tackle the considerable economic,
financial, and structural vulnerabilities in the Chinese economy. Our sense is that the
authorities are willing to tolerate a somewhat faster transition to lower growth than
we previously thought rather than undertake stimulative policies that would
exacerbate these vulnerabilities.
k
o
Inflation picked up in the past few months, largely reflecting a rise in pork prices that o
l
t
u
is expected to persist for several months. However, inflation should dip again toward
O
the end of the year as the recent decline in oil prices passes through to lower domestic &
l
e
fuel prices. We see inflation settling at 2½ percent by the middle of next year. v
e
D
n
 Other Emerging Asia. Second-quarter real GDP growth fell unexpectedly sharply to o
c
1½ percent from 3½ percent in the first quarter. Weak exports contributed to E
l
’
t
negative growth surprises in Singapore and Taiwan, while growth in Korea was n
I
held down by the effects of the MERS epidemic. We see growth rebounding to
3¼ percent in the second half as the effects of the MERS epidemic abate and exports
pick up. Growth is expected to average 4 percent thereafter. Weaker-than-expected
economic data, as well as the recent financial market stress, led us to mark down our
second-half forecast for the region by a little more than ½ percentage point. Further
out, growth is revised down a little from the July Tealbook in response to reductions
in the China forecast. We expect inflation to slow to 2 percent in the current quarter
from 3 percent last quarter, as a result of lower oil prices as well as a weather-related
fall in food prices in India. As these effects pass, inflation should move up to
3¼ percent in 2016.
 Latin America. Mexican real GDP growth edged up to a still-subdued 2 percent in
the second quarter from 1¾ percent in the first. Exports remained weak, reflecting
lackluster U.S. demand and a decline in oil shipments. By contrast, private
consumption continued to improve, supported by job creation and credit growth.
Moreover, investment in machinery and equipment was robust. We see growth
improving, moving up to 2¼ percent in the current quarter and reaching 3 percent by
early 2016. This rebound is supported by a pickup in U.S. demand, the 15 percent
real depreciation in the peso over the past year (driven in part by lower oil prices),

Recent Developments in China
and Their Implications for Our Forecast
In China, weak incoming data, an unexpected devaluation of the renminbi, and a
further collapse of equity prices led to a pronounced heightening of concerns
about the Chinese economy during the intermeeting period, which in turn led to
steep downdrafts in global commodity and financial markets. Investors appear
focused on the possibility that Chinese economic activity is slumping, that the
renminbi may depreciate substantially further, and that these developments could
lead to a global economic slowdown. These are indeed downside risks, but they
are not the most likely scenario in our view.
k
o
o Although recent data do suggest a lower growth trajectory in China, we see little
l
t
u evidence that China is in the midst of a financial or economic crisis. The stock
O
market has few linkages to the real economy, because few households own stocks
&
l and equity financing accounts for a small share of firms’ overall financing.
e
v
e Although industrial production growth (the black line in figure 1) and exports (not
D
shown) both fell in July, the declines were not dramatic. Other indicators offer
n
o grounds for optimism. In particular, China’s housing market, which has exerted a
c
E significant drag on the economy since the middle of last year, appears to have
l
t ’ bottomed out, with prices and sales rising. Job growth has also been strong and
n
I running well ahead of the authorities’ target, as growth in the more labor-intensive
service sector has outpaced growth in manufacturing. And retail sales (the blue
line in figure 1) have been robust, pointing to solid consumption growth. Taken
together, the indicators paint a picture of an economy that is rebalancing, not
crashing.
Many market participants believe that China’s economy is slowing more sharply
than its GDP statistics suggest, but we have found little evidence to support this
view. As seen in figure 2, the staff indicator model—which relates Chinese GDP to
industrial production, imports, and retail sales—generally tracks the GDP data very
well. We have also estimated models using electricity production data and data
from other countries’ exports to China, neither of which suggests that economic
Page 40 of 98

--- Page 44 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 9, 2015
activity has been slowing significantly more in recent quarters than is indicated by
the GDP data.
Nonetheless, we took some signal from recent developments and marked down
our projection for China’s growth over the forecast period. In addition to the
weaker-than-expected data, the downward revision reflects our view that rising
uncertainty about the ability of policymakers to manage an orderly rebalancing,
particularly in light of the authorities’ ineffective and costly interventions in
response to the stock market crash, has likely diminished the confidence of
households, firms, and investors. For their part, notwithstanding some recent
policy easing, policymakers appear focused on reining in financial vulnerabilities,
and this could constrain their willingness to provide significant fiscal or monetary
k
stimulus. We now see growth hovering around 6¼ percent through 2016 and o
o
l
falling gradually to 6 percent by the end of 2018. Even with this downward t
u
revision—averaging about ½ percentage point—to our growth outlook, we see O
&
risks in China as more tilted to the downside than we did in the previous Tealbook.
l
e
v
e
We also revised our path for the renminbi. Instead of staying flat against the dollar D
over the rest of the year, the renminbi is now expected to depreciate a modest n
o
2 percent. The People’s Bank of China is currently intervening to support the c
E
renminbi, but in the face of heightened capital outflows associated with weaker l
’
t
n
growth, it will probably allow some further decline in the currency’s value, though
I
it would likely act to prevent a sharper and more destabilizing depreciation.
Eventually, we expect the renminbi to resume appreciating, given China’s higher
productivity growth relative to its trading partners and the continued need to
rebalance its economy. Nonetheless, the level of the renminbi exchange rate at
the end of 2018 is about 6 percent weaker than our July Tealbook path. In light of
heightened uncertainties about growth and investor confidence, we see some risk
that the currency will be weaker than we are forecasting.
The modest slowing of Chinese growth and limited further depreciation of the
renminbi in our baseline forecast are expected to have a relatively small effect on
the global economy. We marked down EME growth by ¼ percentage point on
average over the forecast period, and we also increased the expected pace of
depreciation of emerging Asian currencies relative to the dollar this year, in part to
help maintain competitiveness against the renminbi. Given China’s relatively small
share of U.S. exports (about 7½ percent), the direct effect of slower growth in
China on U.S. economic activity in our baseline forecast is small. The main channel
of transmission occurs indirectly through lower EME growth and especially a
stronger dollar. Indeed, simulations using our SIGMA model suggest that even the
downside risk of a severe slump in China would have little effect on U.S. growth in
the absence of spillovers to other EMEs. But, as discussed in the Risks and
Uncertainty section, we estimate that in scenarios where financial and economic
disruptions in China do spill over to other EMEs, the effects on U.S. and global
economic growth could be significant.

and a small boost from the country’s energy reform. We revised down our estimate
for the second half of this year by ½ percentage point given the further decline in the
price of oil as well as the downward revision to U.S. manufacturing output.
We penciled in a rise in inflation to 3¼ percent in the current quarter from 2¾ percent
in the second, reflecting the waning effect of declines in energy and other
administered prices earlier this year. We expect inflation to remain at that rate over
the rest of the forecast period. Bank of Mexico (BOM) officials have expressed
concern that the peso’s depreciation will stoke inflationary pressures, but given the
economic slack, we now expect that the BOM will not begin to raise its policy rate
k
o
o until the fourth quarter of this year.
l
t
u
O
& Brazilian real GDP plunged 7¼ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter,
e l 3 percentage points more than we had expected, following a 3 percent decline in the
v
e
D first quarter. Private domestic demand, especially investment, fell sharply in response
n
o to very weak consumer and business confidence. With the political situation
c
E
worsening, commodity prices remaining low, and global growth weaker, we now
l
’
t
n expect that the recession will be deeper and longer than we did previously.
I
Accordingly, we have the economy contracting 1¾ percent in the second half of this
year, 1½ percentage points more than in the July Tealbook. Growth should turn
positive next year and pick up further to a still-sluggish 2 percent in 2017, as
monetary policy begins to ease by mid-2016 and business confidence improves.
Despite the weak economy, the substantial depreciation of the real and increases in
administered prices have kept inflation stubbornly high, at an estimated 10 percent
annual rate in the current quarter. To restrain inflation, the central bank has raised its
policy rate 325 basis points since October 2014. We expect past policy tightening,
lower pressure from administered prices, and economic slack to bring inflation down
to 5½ percent by 2017.
The fall in commodity prices is also restraining economic activity in other Latin
American countries. In Chile, real GDP remained about flat in the second quarter,
down from 4½ percent growth in the first quarter. The downturn was broad based
and led by weak domestic demand, particularly investment.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Euro Area. Real GDP grew 1.4 percent in the second quarter, slightly below our July
Tealbook estimate. More recent indicators, such as the composite purchasing
managers index (PMI), suggest that output is expanding a touch faster in the current
quarter. We expect GDP growth to rise to 2 percent next year and remain at that pace
over the rest of the forecast period, supported by ongoing monetary stimulus, lower
oil prices, and easing credit conditions. Compared with the July Tealbook, this
forecast is slightly weaker throughout the projection period, as the drag from a
stronger euro, a weaker global outlook, and lower stock prices is only partly offset by k
o
o
a boost from lower oil prices and expected additional monetary policy
l
t
u
accommodation. O
&
l
Headline inflation is on track to fall to ¼ percent in the third quarter (from 2.3 percent e
v
e
D
in the second quarter), reflecting a sharp decline in energy prices; however, core
n
inflation appears to be holding steady at around 1¼ percent. We expect inflation to o
c
E
step up to 1¾ percent by the end of 2018 as the effect of lower energy prices wanes l
’
t
n
and the output gap narrows. This projection is a bit weaker than in the July Tealbook, I
largely due to lower energy prices and a stronger euro. Given the weaker outlook for
growth and inflation, we now expect the ECB to continue its asset purchases beyond
September 2016, and we revised our forecast of total purchases up by €100 billion to
about €1.2 trillion. We expect the ECB to leave its main policy rate unchanged until
the second half of 2018.
Although financial stresses emanating from Greece moderated since the previous
Tealbook, the Greek government stepped down, and Greek authorities scheduled
another national parliamentary election for September 20. Political instability and
domestic opposition to austerity will likely continue to fuel financial tensions in
Greece, but we still expect that spillovers to other European countries will remain
limited.
 Japan. Following a strong expansion in the first quarter, real GDP unexpectedly
contracted at a 1.2 percent pace in the second quarter, as exports and private
consumption declined. However, data on exports and household spending for July
and PMI data through August suggest that economic activity is rebounding in the
current quarter, with GDP estimated to rise 1 percent. We see growth remaining near
Page 43 of 98

--- Page 47 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 9, 2015
that pace through 2016 before a hike in the consumption tax stalls the expansion in
2017. Given the markdown to global growth and a substantial appreciation of the
yen, we lowered our Japanese growth forecast by ½ percentage point in the second
half of 2015 and by a small amount in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation rose to 1.7 percent in the second quarter, led by a rapid increase in food
prices. However, with the stronger yen and lower oil prices, consumer prices should
decline a bit in the second half of the year. Thereafter, as energy prices begin to rise
and the output gap narrows, we project that inflation (excluding the direct effect of
k the consumption tax hike) will recover to 1¼ percent in 2017.
o
o
l
t
u
 Canada. Real GDP fell 0.5 percent in the second quarter, a bit more than we
O
& estimated in the previous Tealbook, but a rebound in monthly GDP in June and strong
l
e
v export growth in June and July point to recovery. We now expect growth of nearly
e
D
2 percent in the second half of this year, as the temporary factors that had been
n
o
c holding back growth, including wildfires that disrupted energy production, come off.
E
’ l Growth should average around that rate over the rest of the forecast, supported by
t
n
I accommodative monetary policy and rising oil prices. This forecast is a little lower
than in the July Tealbook, as recent declines in commodity prices and the weaker
outlook for U.S. growth are expected to weigh on Canadian growth, more than
offsetting the boost from recent currency depreciation.
Lower energy prices should cause inflation to slow to 1½ percent in the second half
of this year. By 2017, we see inflation edging up to the BOC’s 2 percent target as the
output gap closes. We expect weaker growth prospects and contained inflation
pressures to lead the BOC to postpone its first rate hike until the first quarter of 2017,
two quarters later than previously assumed.
 United Kingdom. Real GDP expanded 2.7 percent in the second quarter, up from
1.5 percent in the first quarter. Recent indicators, including PMIs, consumer
confidence, and retail sales, have been strong, but the weaker global outlook and
somewhat tighter financial conditions are expected to offset this added momentum.
Thus, we continue to project growth at close to 2½ percent in the second half of the
year and throughout the projection period.
Inflation in the third quarter is projected to increase to 1¾ percent, despite the fall in
energy prices, as a sharp rise in core prices in July suggested a reversal of their

disinflationary trend over the past year. After edging down in the fourth quarter,
inflation is expected to increase in 2016 toward the 2 percent target of the Bank of
England (BOE), as the effect of energy price declines dissipates and slack in the
economy is eliminated. This forecast is slightly weaker in the near term on account
of the recent decline in energy prices. In line with the rise in inflation and the
tightening labor market, we continue to expect the BOE to begin raising its policy
rate in the first quarter of 2016.

Financial Developments
Concerns about global growth prospects, centered on China, contributed to an
increase in financial market volatility and a deterioration in risk sentiment in the United
States and abroad during the intermeeting period. Although incoming news on domestic
economic activity generally met market expectations, the volatility in financial markets
boosted uncertainty about the timing of liftoff. That said, short- and long-term nominal
Treasury yields were little changed on net.
 Market- and survey-based probabilities for an initial increase in the federal
funds rate in September moved down, on balance, while the probability of
liftoff in 2016 increased. The probabilities of liftoff occurring at the
September or December meeting are on the order of 20 to 30 percent.
 The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes flattened
over the intermeeting period. The implied federal funds rate is about
0.3 percent at the end of 2015 and 0.8 percent at the end of 2016.
 The U.S. dollar appreciated about 2 percent, rising against most emerging
market currencies but declining against the euro and the yen.

level.
 Liquidity in foreign exchange, Treasury, equity, and corporate bond markets
deteriorated at times during the period, but effects on market functioning and
pricing appear to have been limited and short lived.
 Financing conditions remained generally accommodative, but the increase in
financial market volatility resulted in a modest tightening of conditions for
businesses.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS
On net, the probability for a September liftoff implied by federal funds futures
moved down over the intermeeting period.1 Early in the period, the market-based
probability for a September liftoff firmed as incoming data showed some further
improvement in the labor market and as some policymakers’ comments appeared to be
supportive of an imminent liftoff. Subsequently, market participants revised down
significantly the odds they placed on a September tightening amid turbulence in global
equity and foreign exchange markets, perhaps in part because the minutes pointed to
financial and international developments as factors in the FOMC’s evaluation of progress
toward their objectives. Comments from some FOMC members were seen as supporting
this view. The odds of a September liftoff rebounded slightly, on net, late in the period as
domestic equity markets calmed, incoming data on economic activity generally met
market expectations, and statements by policymakers suggested that a September liftoff
was still on the table.
The uncertainty around the date of liftoff derived from federal funds futures rose
notably as the probabilities of liftoff at the September and December meetings fell and
the probability of liftoff in October and 2016 rose.2 Moreover, the expected path of the
federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes flattened, on balance, over the intermeeting
period: The implied federal funds rate at the end of 2015 was down about 5 basis points s
t
n
to 0.3 percent, and the rate implied at the end of 2016 declined about 17 basis points to e
m
p
0.8 percent.
o
l
e
v
e
According to the Desk’s surveys of dealers and market participants, the average D
l
a
of respondents’ probability distributions shifted toward later liftoff dates relative to the i
c
n
July surveys. Respondents are now about evenly split between those viewing September a
n
i
and December as the most likely date of liftoff. The expected pace of tightening F
1 The Board’s staff used the following assumptions to compute liftoff probabilities from quotes on
the federal funds futures contract expiring at the end of September 2015: The average federal funds rate
between September 1 and September 17 equals its 30-day average; the federal funds rate after September
17 equals 12.5 basis points if there is no liftoff or 37.5 basis points if there is liftoff. Popular alternative
assumptions generate implied probabilities for a September liftoff that range from 20 percent to 35 percent.
2 Positions held by unhedged investors in federal funds and 90-day Eurodollar futures—which are
thought to reflect speculative investors’ expectations of future interest rate developments—are currently
near neutral, suggesting that these investors’ policy expectations are roughly in line with those implied by
the market-based measures.

following liftoff is little changed, but the median estimate of the federal funds rate at the
end of 2016 is down 25 basis points. Dealers and market participants pushed out slightly
the expected timing of the end of the FOMC’s reinvestments.
TREASURY YIELDS AND TREASURY FINANCE
Despite the decline in global equity markets and the downshift in the expected
path of the federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities were up a bit at short
horizons and down a touch at the 5- and 10-year horizons. Swap rates and some other
benchmark yields declined noticeably across the maturity structure. Some market
participants cited the selling of Treasury securities by foreign central banks as a possible
factor putting upward pressure on Treasury yields.
The 5- and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS
declined 14 basis points and 27 basis points, respectively, and are now back near their
historical lows. The decreases were reportedly driven in part by declines in oil prices, the
strengthening of the dollar, and slightly weaker-than-expected readings on realized
inflation. The 5-to-10-year measure of inflation compensation derived from inflation
swaps—which is typically not affected by technical factors in Treasury markets—
declined a little less over the period but also fell to near its historical lows.

On July 30, Treasury Secretary Lew extended the “debt issuance suspension n
a
n
period” through October 30, which allows the Treasury Department to use extraordinary

F
measures to remain under the debt limit while issuing new securities.4 Staff and private-
sector projections suggest that these measures should allow federal debt to stay below its
statutory ceiling at least into November.
3 Since the July FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned $243 billion of Treasury
nominal fixed-coupon securities, $16 billion of TIPS, and $28 billion of two-year FRNs.
4 The accounting measures available to the Treasury include suspending daily reinvestment of the
Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund, redeeming existing investments
and suspending new investment in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, and suspending the
daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund into Treasury securities.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Global financial markets have been volatile since the July FOMC meeting, as
investor concerns about a slowdown in global growth were amplified by thin summer
trading and skittishness as U.S. liftoff approaches. Much of this volatility emanated from
China, where weak manufacturing and export data exacerbated worries about slowing
growth. (See the box “Recent Developments in China and Their Implications for Our
Forecast” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section.) These
worries were intensified when the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly
changed its exchange rate policy, resulting in a 3 percent devaluation of the renminbi
over the next week. Subsequently, the PBOC undertook other actions to reduce further
depreciation pressure on the renminbi, reportedly selling reserve assets and increasing the
specific reserve requirements for Chinese banks selling the U.S. dollar in the forward
market. Later in the period, a sharp decline in Chinese stock prices, which occurred a
few days after reports that policymakers would withdraw credit support for equity
purchases, rattled global markets and appeared to threaten confidence in China’s ability
to manage its economy. In part to support the stock market, Chinese authorities cut
benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points and the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis
points. Along with an apparent reversal on credit support for equity purchases, these
actions seemed to calm equity markets, which ended the period down by about 13
percent. t s

The U.S. dollar appreciated against most currencies during the heightened market
volatility, and the broad index of the dollar ended the intermeeting period 2¼ percent
higher. Asian EME currencies moved in sympathy with the renminbi and are down 3 to
6 percent against the dollar. Mexico’s and Brazil’s currencies fell 3½ percent and
14 percent, respectively, because of commodity exposures and, in Brazil, deteriorating
economic and political conditions. Mexico and Brazil increased their foreign exchange
interventions to support their respective currencies, and the Brazilian central bank raised
its benchmark policy rate 50 basis points.

Movements in the dollar were mixed against the currencies of the advanced
foreign economies (AFEs). The British pound is down about 1½ percent against the
dollar, with most of the change occurring following the August policy meeting of the
Bank of England, at which there were fewer votes in favor of raising rates than had been
expected. The Canadian dollar depreciated 2¼ percent against the dollar, reflecting the
effect of declining oil prices on prospects for the Canadian economy. In contrast, the
Japanese yen appreciated 3 percent against the dollar on flight-to-safety flows and the
unwinding of carry trades funded in yen. The euro appreciated in August, consistent with
lower market expectations for U.S. policy rates and an unwinding of euro-funded carry
trade positions. The euro partially retraced this increase following the release of a
weaker-than-expected ECB staff economic outlook and communication by ECB
President Draghi that signaled the ECB’s willingness to expand its quantitative easing
program in the future.
AFE sovereign yields ended the period somewhat lower, in part because of a
markdown in expectations for future policy rates. The decline was most pronounced in
the United Kingdom, where the 10-year yield is down about 10 basis points on net.
Greek sovereign spreads narrowed by about 320 basis points over the period, as Greece
and the euro area finalized Greece’s third bailout package. In contrast, concerns about
the global slowdown and falling commodity prices widened spreads on EME dollar-
s
denominated debt by about 20 to 30 basis points. t

foreign exposures. Another factor depressing domestic stock prices was reportedly a
reassessment of equity market risk and appropriate valuations. Indeed, the decline in
stock prices was broad based, and the market was very volatile over the period, especially
in late August and early September, when the one-month-ahead option-implied volatility
on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—reached levels last seen in 2011.
Bid-asked spreads in equity markets temporarily increased during the days of the
sharpest stock price declines, and trading halts were triggered for certain stocks. Some
ETFs experienced pricing troubles that were resolved within a few days.

Spreads of yields on BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over
comparable-maturity Treasury securities have both widened, on net, 12 basis points since
the July FOMC meeting. Spreads on BBB-rated bonds ended the period somewhat above
their historical medians, while those for speculative-grade bonds remained close to their
historical medians. Speculative-grade issuers in the energy sector experienced more
notable increases in spreads than did firms in other industries. Measures of liquidity
conditions suggest that corporate bond markets functioned fairly well, even during the
peaks of market volatility.
With most firms in the S&P 500 having reported earnings for the second quarter,
the staff estimates that earnings per share for these firms increased slightly relative to
first-quarter levels. Through the end of August, private-sector equity analysts revised
down slightly their projections for year-ahead earnings.
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses tightened modestly over the
summer, although the effects on business finance of the declines in equity prices and
increases in bond spreads are difficult to discern given data lags and typical summer
slowdowns in financing activity. Corporate bond and institutional leveraged loan
issuance remained solid through July but moderated in August. Public equity issuance
s
t
n
also stayed solid, though it slowed for firms conducting initial public offerings.
e
m
Similarly, the growth of C&I loans on banks’ books moderated in July and August, p
o

mostly for banks with a higher concentration of exposures to oil and gas firms. Financing e

August, which analysts attributed to heavy issuance as well as increased volatility in
broader financial markets.

bonds were little changed, on net, and overall credit conditions in municipal bond
markets remained stable.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Credit conditions for residential mortgages continued to improve slowly over the
intermeeting period. Nevertheless, credit remains tight for borrowers with low credit
scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios. Interest rates on 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages declined 6 basis points, in line with changes in agency MBS yields.
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally
accommodative over the summer, and the performance of outstanding consumer loans
was largely stable. Credit card balances expanded further in July against the backdrop of
gradually easing lending standards, and student and auto loans continued to be broadly
available, even to borrowers with subprime credit scores. Delinquency rates on credit
card loans and auto loans stayed low through the second quarter. That said, delinquency
rates on recently originated subprime auto loans continued to edge up, partly reflecting
increased lending activity to the riskiest borrowers. Indeed, average credit scores among
borrowers purchasing both new and used vehicles continued to trend down slightly.
Delinquency rates on student loans remained elevated.

by commercial banks decelerated a bit, driven by a decline in the growth of securities.
Holdings of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) decreased in the second quarter at banks
subject to the standard liquidity coverage ratio. The decrease in HQLA, however, has
likely had a minimal effect on banks’ liquidity coverage ratios, as it has been coupled
with a reduction in non-operational deposits provided by financial institutions at a few
global systemically important banking organizations.
Profitability at BHCs increased slightly in the second quarter but remained below
the levels observed in the decade prior to the financial crisis. Net interest margins
improved modestly last quarter, and noninterest income rose on increases in investment
banking revenue and a pickup in mortgage activity. More recently, stock prices of large
domestic BHCs declined about 8 percent, a bit more than the broader stock market. CDS
spreads for the these BHCs moved up less than they did for other investment-grade firms,
suggesting that global developments have had only a modest effect on perceived bank
solvency.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). As before, we see the risks to our forecast for real GDP
growth as weighted to the downside because neither monetary nor fiscal policy appears
well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks. This downside skew is
increased by the recent turbulence in financial markets as well as by the possibility of
even greater weakness in the Chinese and other emerging market economies than we
have assumed in our baseline projection. Consistent with these downside risks to
aggregate demand and with the further adjustments we introduced this round to the
supply side of the projection, we now view the risks around our unemployment rate
projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to the upside.
(Previously, in light of the tendency of the unemployment rate to move lower than we
expected, we viewed the risks around our unemployment projection as balanced—and
thus not aligned in the intuitive manner with the GDP risks.)
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. At the same time, we
continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside. TIPS-
based five-year forward inflation compensation has declined significantly and is back
near its historic low. Moreover, core PCE price inflation remains below the Committee’s
target, raising the odds that we may be underestimating the degree of slack in the
economy. Furthermore, in light of the turmoil in China and elsewhere, major foreign
central banks may continue to conduct aggressive policies to fight their own shortfalls in
aggregate demand and cause the dollar to be stronger than in the baseline, leading to
greater downward pressure on U.S. inflation than we have anticipated.

among these firms is near record highs. Further, hedge fund leverage has risen. And
commercial real estate valuation pressures have continued to rise, with several of the
leading price indexes moving back up to their pre-recession nominal peaks. Finally,
bond prices may be more volatile in response to stress than in the past given recent
changes in the structure of bond markets.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first
scenario illustrates potential consequences of increased financial volatility on the
economy. The second scenario looks at the possibility that productivity growth may pick
up substantially as firms learn to take full advantage of new information technology. In
the third scenario, we examine the risks to our inflation outlook that stem from lower
long-term inflation expectations. The fourth and fifth scenarios consider the
consequences either of a slowdown or of a full-blown crisis in the EMEs triggered by
financial turmoil in China.
We generate the first scenario in consultation with staff from the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York using a DSGE model they developed that explicitly incorporates
financial frictions. The second scenario uses the EDO model. The third scenario uses the
FRB/US model. The final two scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA
model. The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended
to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the Committee’s recent
statements. Once the federal funds rate has risen above its current target range, its
movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast—by an inertial version of the
Taylor (1999) rule.1 In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA
portfolio follow their baseline paths.

Increased Financial Turbulence
Measures of financial market volatility such as the VIX have spiked in recent
weeks. The spread of Baa-rated corporate bonds over Treasury securities, another
measure of financial market turbulence, has risen about 75 basis points since the
beginning of the year. In this alternative scenario, we explore the consequences of a
larger increase in the Baa spread. The DSGE model underlying the scenario explicitly
models risk spreads and is estimated using data on spreads. In the scenario, we assume
that the spread rises 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and then gradually returns to a
more normal level.
We attribute the source of the rise in spreads to an increase in household and
investor risk aversion, resulting in a drop in aggregate demand and higher financing costs
for firms’ capital expenditures. Under these circumstances, the economy contracts
sharply in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate rises to 5½ percent by the end of
the year before a gradual recovery gets under way in the middle of 2016. Core PCE
inflation is slightly below baseline for the entire simulation period. The federal funds
rate path is substantially lower.
Productivity Growth Speeds Up
Productivity growth in the recent past has been slower than its long-run average.
This scenario considers the possibility that the current slowdown is only temporary and is
in fact the harbinger of higher productivity gains in the future. In particular, new forms
of IT investment in cloud computing and mobility-enhancing technologies such as tablets
and smartphones, as well as increased use of big data, may initially be difficult for firms
to utilize efficiently. Indeed, in the initial transition phase, implementing these
innovations may actually impede gains in productivity. Similar to the wave of IT-based
productivity that began slowly in the 1980s and accelerated through the late 1990s, the
payoffs for today’s IT may accelerate in future years. This simulation assumes that
productivity growth over the next five years will be around 2 percent per year,
1 percentage point faster than in the baseline.

marginal cost of production and, hence, price pressure. The federal funds rate takes a
shallower path, reaching 50 basis points below baseline by the end of 2019, reflecting the
net effects of substantially lower inflation readings and greater resource utilization.
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations
The extended period of below-target inflation experienced while at the zero lower
bound could affect the long-term inflation expectations that are relevant for wage and
price setting. If beliefs about long-term inflation are formed adaptively based on realized
past inflation, achieving convergence of inflation to the 2 percent target will be
substantially more difficult. This simulation assumes that consumers currently see long-
term inflation as equaling 1.5 percent (the average inflation rate of the past seven years)
and form their long-term inflation expectations adaptively throughout the simulation.2
The subdued inflation expectations and low actual inflation in the coming years
are mutually reinforcing. Inflation falls to 1.2 percent at the end of 2016 and does not
rise above 1.5 percent until after 2019. The overall path of the federal funds rate is
significantly lower than in the baseline and increasingly so as the simulation continues.
The paths of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged.
China-Driven EME Slowdown
Although our baseline forecast projects that growth in China will be reasonably
solid, averaging about 6 percent over the next few years, downside risks to the outlook
for China and the EMEs appear to have risen markedly. Any number of developments—
including a bond default, a property market bust, or loss of confidence in the ability of the
Chinese authorities to stabilize the economy—could interact with and amplify China’s
many underlying financial vulnerabilities and possibly trigger a broad-based crisis. In
this scenario, we assume that China experiences a financial meltdown that also
significantly weakens growth in other EME economies.

Specifically, our scenario assumes that China’s GDP falls about 7 percent below
baseline over the next two years. In response to the effects of this slump on trade,
commodity prices, and financial conditions, GDP in other EMEs declines about
3½ percent relative to baseline, in line with staff regression estimates of the effects of
changes in Chinese GDP growth on other EMEs. In addition, flight-to-quality flows into
dollar-denominated assets contribute to an 8 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar
and cause term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities and AFE government bonds to
decline slightly.
In response to weaker foreign economic growth and the appreciation of the dollar,
U.S. real net exports decline relative to baseline and real GDP growth falls to only
1¼ percent in 2016. The unemployment rate climbs above 5 percent by late 2016, about
¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline. Given the stronger dollar and lower
resource utilization, core PCE inflation declines to less than 1 percent in 2016. The
federal funds rate follows a somewhat shallower path than in the baseline.
China-Driven EME Crisis
This scenario builds on the previous scenario but assumes that China’s financial
meltdown hits other EMEs much harder, triggering deeper financial disruptions that spill
over to the rest of the global economy, including the United States. Our scenario
assumes that EME borrowing costs soar and that EME business and household
confidence collapses. EME real GDP—for both China and other EMEs—declines
7 percent relative to baseline by the end of 2016, while EME currencies depreciate more
than 20 percent against the dollar. The effect on aggregate EME growth roughly parallels
the growth slowdown that occurred during the Asian and Russian crises of the late 1990s,
though the EME currency depreciation in the scenario is a little larger.
In response to stresses in EMEs, corporate and household borrowing spreads rise
sharply and equity prices sink in both the United States and AFEs, while flight-to-safety
flows push down term premiums on government bond yields. Commodity prices tumble

and, partly because commodity currencies fall sharply, the broad real dollar appreciates t

Moreover, tighter financial conditions and lower confidence reduce U.S. aggregate
demand. All told, U.S. real GDP contracts at an annual rate of about 1 percent in 2016,
and the unemployment rate increases to 6½ percent in 2017, 1¾ percentage points higher
than in the baseline. The appreciation of the dollar and greater resource slack push down
U.S. core PCE inflation to around zero in 2016. The progressive widening of resource
slack and subdued inflation imply that the federal funds rate returns to the zero lower
bound in 2016 and remains there for about two years.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that yy

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
