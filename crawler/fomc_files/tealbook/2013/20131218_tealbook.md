Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information that we have received since the October Tealbook suggests that D
n
real GDP is increasing a bit more, on average, over the second half of this year than we o
c
E
had previously expected. In part, the modest upgrade in our assessment reflects larger
c
i
t
contributions from categories, such as inventory investment and government purchases, s
e
m
that convey little signal for the ongoing thrust of aggregate demand. But the data on o
D
private domestic final demand also appear to have been a bit better, on balance, than we
had anticipated. In particular, consumer spending appears to be accelerating more in the
fourth quarter than we had assumed, and business fixed investment seems to be on a
slightly stronger trajectory. In contrast, housing activity has once again surprised us on
the downside, as the rise in mortgage rates since the spring seems to be restraining
housing activity by somewhat more than we had expected. In all, our forecast for real
GDP growth over the second half of this year now stands at an average annual rate of
2½ percent, ½ percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook, and we expect
growth to pick up to a 2¾ percent pace in the first quarter of next year. In the labor
market, increases in payroll employment were greater in October and November than we
had anticipated, and the unemployment rate declined more, on net, since September.
Our medium-term projection for real activity also is a bit stronger than in the
October Tealbook, as the slight reduction in fiscal restraint from the recent federal budget
deal, a lower trajectory for interest rates, and somewhat higher paths for equity prices and
home values more than offset a higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
We continue to expect that economic activity will expand more quickly over the next few
years than it did in 2013, reflecting a still-accommodative stance of monetary policy and
the waning of some of the forces—including federal fiscal policy and the stresses in
Europe—that have restrained economic growth in recent years. Our current forecast has
real GDP growth stepping up from a pace of 2¼ percent this year to 3 percent in 2014
and 3½ percent in both 2015 and 2016.
Consistent with the acceleration in real GDP, we project the unemployment rate
to decline from about 7 percent in the current quarter to 5¼ percent at the end of 2016,
thereby reaching the staff’s estimate of the natural rate. As in our October Tealbook
forecast, the unemployment rate crosses the Committee’s 6.5 percent threshold near the
beginning of 2015.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following
the September FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the
staff economic projection since the September Tealbook.
The staff projection for real GDP growth is about the same as in the September
Tealbook on net. The unemployment rate has come in lower than we expected
El in September. We have taken this lower level on board in the near term, but we
still project the unemployment rate to end 2016 at 51/4 percent, in line with the
essentially unrevised GDP outlook.
The staff projection for both overall and core PCE inflation has revised a little
lower this year relative to the September projection. Beyond this year, however,
the projection for both core and headline inflation is about unrevised, with
inflation edging gradually higher.
The unemployment rate is still projected to cross the Committee’s 6.5 percent
threshold in early 2015, and the policy rule that governs our assumption for the
federal funds rate calls for the rate to lift off from the effective lower bound in
the second quarter of 2015, the same as in September. The trajectory of the
federal funds rate after liftoff is also the same.

The data we have received on PCE prices since the October Tealbook have been u t
O
softer than we had anticipated, in part reflecting lower-than-expected prices for medical
&
services. But beyond the near term, our projection for core inflation is essentially the e l
v
e
same as in our previous forecast, with core PCE inflation expected to rise from about D
n
1 percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 2016. We continue to anticipate that energy prices o
c
E
will edge down over the forecast period, causing headline inflation to run a bit below core
c
i
t
inflation. s
e
m
o
D
We view the degree of uncertainty attending our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as being similar to the average over the past 20 years—the
benchmark used by the FOMC.1 We continue to view the risks to our forecast for real
GDP growth as being skewed to the downside, in part because neither monetary policy
nor fiscal policy appear well positioned to combat future adverse shocks to economic
activity. However, we see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as
roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse demand-side
developments countered by the possibility of a continuation of the downward surprises
for the unemployment rate that we have seen in recent years. In addition, we regard the
uncertainty around our inflation forecast as being about normal and view these risks as
broadly balanced. Our assessment of the risks around our forecasts for real GDP growth
and inflation is unchanged from the September Tealbook—the last time that Committee
participants submitted economic projections.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
We have shifted our assumption for the slowing in purchases under the current
LSAP program toward a slightly later timing than we had assumed in our October
projection, thereby increasing the cumulative account of purchases under the current
program by $165 billion. We now assume that the pace of purchases will begin to slow
in the first quarter of 2014 and will end in the latter half of 2014, bringing the cumulative
amount of purchases under the current program to $1.4 trillion.
1 Beginning with this Tealbook, in order to better align our assessment with the Committee’s
Summary of Economic Projections, we separately evaluate the risks and uncertainties for our forecasts of
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate.

With the unemployment rate projected to fall below the Committee’s 6.5 percent u t
O
threshold near the beginning of 2015, we continue to assume that the federal funds rate
&
will lift off from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015 and thereafter e l
v
e
rise at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) D
n
policy rule. As in the October Tealbook, the federal funds rate reaches 2 percent at the o
c
E
end of 2016.

m
Other Interest Rates
o
D
The 10-year Treasury yield has risen about 30 basis points since the October
Tealbook, a larger increase than we had projected. Over the medium term, our forecast
still calls for Treasury yields to rise significantly, primarily reflecting the movement of
the 10-year valuation window through the period of extremely low short-term interest
rates as well as a gradual waning of the effects of the FOMC’s LSAP program.
Nonetheless, toward the end of the projection period, we have the 10-year Treasury yield
somewhat lower in this Tealbook than in the previous one, reflecting the slight increase
in the expected size of the LSAP program and a lower assumed medium-term level of the
term premium.
Rates for conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have increased roughly in
line with the yields on comparable maturity Treasury securities over the intermeeting
period, and yields on 10-year investment-grade corporate bonds have risen just a bit
less. As a result, our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the
medium term have been revised essentially in line with the revision to Treasury yields.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
Equity prices have risen about 1½ percent since the October Tealbook, a bit more
than we had anticipated. We have carried forward the higher level of stock prices over
the next few quarters, but because we think that the recent gains largely reflect a
narrowing of the equity risk premium that we had anticipated to occur later in the
projection, our forecast for stock prices is essentially unrevised by the end of 2016. We
continue to expect equity prices to move up at an average annual rate of about 6½ percent
over the next few years, a pace that we think will bring the equity risk premium down
toward more typical levels by the end of the medium-term forecast.
House prices have moved up by a bit more since the October Tealbook than we
had projected. However, the projected rate of house price appreciation over the forecast

k
o
o
l
u t period is little changed relative to the October Tealbook projection, and we continue to
O
anticipate that house prices will decelerate from the rapid pace of increase seen over the
&
e l past year.
v
e
D
n Fiscal Policy
o
c
E We have adjusted our fiscal policy assumptions to incorporate the enactment of
c
i
s t the recently announced budget deal in the Congress. We continue to anticipate that the
e
m
federal debt limit will be lifted again in the coming months before significant financial
o
D
market disruptions occur, and that the emergency unemployment compensation program
will be allowed to expire at the end of this year.
Federal fiscal policy has exerted considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate
demand in 2013 as a result of the sequestration, additional decreases in defense purchases
associated with the drawdown of overseas military operations, the expiration of the
payroll tax cut, and the implementation of other tax increases at the beginning of this
year. Excluding multiplier effects, changes in fiscal policy at all levels of government are
projected to reduce real GDP growth by 1 percentage point this year, ½ percentage point
in 2014, ¼ percentage point in 2015, and to have little effect in 2016; in addition, we
estimate that the recent budget deal will ease the fiscal restraint on real GDP growth in
2014 by 0.1 percentage point. As in the previous projection, the federal unified budget
deficit is projected to narrow from 4 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2013 to 2¼ percent of
GDP by fiscal 2016, reflecting both ongoing budget consolidation and further
improvements in the economy that generate stronger gains in tax receipts.
Foreign Activity and the Dollar
We estimate that foreign real GDP will post a second consecutive quarter of
3 percent growth in the current quarter, up considerably from its sluggish first-half rate.
Our estimates for both the third and fourth quarters are a little higher than in the October
Tealbook, mainly reflecting slightly stronger growth in the emerging market economies.
The Mexican economy rebounded somewhat more sharply than expected in the third
quarter following a second-quarter contraction, and recent indicators of economic activity
in China have been positive. The euro-area economy continued its slow exit from
recession and financial stress. We continue to expect foreign economic growth to
improve gradually over the forecast period, averaging 3¼ percent next year and then
leveling off near 3½ percent through the end of 2016.

The broad nominal dollar index has increased about 1¼ percent since the previous u t
O
Tealbook. The dollar strengthened against most other currencies as market participants
&
assigned a higher probability to an earlier start to Federal Reserve tapering and increased e l
v
e
their expectations for additional monetary accommodation in some foreign economies. D
n
Looking ahead, we project that the broad real dollar will depreciate at an annual rate of o
c
E
about 2¼ percent over the medium term, about the same pace that we had projected in the
c
i
t
October Tealbook. Our forecast of dollar depreciation continues to be driven by our s
e
m
assumption that financial stress in the euro area will abate further over the forecast o
D
period, resulting in reduced safe-haven demands for the dollar; we also assume that the
dollar will resume its trend depreciation against emerging market currencies.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
The spot price of Brent crude oil is little changed since the time of the previous
Tealbook, closing at $109 per barrel on December 10. Market analysts have become
more pessimistic about the outlook for Libyan oil production—and apparently by enough
to offset any optimism that might have been engendered by the temporary agreement to
contain Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions. The spot price of
West Texas Intermediate is also little changed. As in the October Tealbook, we project
the price of imported oil to remain at about $100 per barrel in 2014 and then to decline
over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching $93 per barrel at the end of 2016.
Our broad index of nonfuel commodity prices is little changed relative to the
October Tealbook, with the prices of many commodities exhibiting the lowest daily
volatility in recent years. Over the forecast period, as in the previous Tealbook, we
expect this index to increase only slightly, consistent with futures prices and our
projected depreciation of the dollar.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The information we have received since the October Tealbook has led us to
increase our forecast for real GDP growth over the second half of this year by
½ percentage point to an average annual rate of 2½ percent, and we expect economic
growth to rise to a 2¾ percent pace in the first quarter of next year. Consumer spending
appears to be accelerating more in the fourth quarter than we had previously projected,
and business fixed investment seems to be on a slightly stronger trajectory. Inventory
investment and government purchases in the third quarter were also notably stronger than
we had anticipated, but we expect the surprise from these categories to mostly unwind

over the near term. Moreover, the slowing in housing activity since midyear now appears u t
O
to have been more pronounced than we previously expected, and we have marked down

our near-term projection for the growth of residential investment. e

D
Household Spending n
o
c
We now estimate that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the E
c
i
current quarter, up from a 1½ percent pace in the third quarter.2 The October reading for s t
e
m
PCE was solid, and light motor vehicle sales surged in November, consistent with a
o
D
pickup in real PCE growth for the fourth quarter as a whole that is about ½ percentage
point greater than in the October Tealbook. In addition, the level of private wages and
salaries was revised up, and the preliminary December reading of the Michigan survey
measure of consumer sentiment reversed the declines seen since the summer. In the first
quarter of next year, we now project that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of
2¾ percent. As before, we attribute the near-term acceleration in consumer spending
relative to that seen earlier this year to the effect of gains in household net wealth, the
waning effects of the tax increases imposed at the beginning of the year, and further
increases in personal income. The projected increase in spending next quarter would be
larger if not for the currently scheduled termination of the emergency unemployment
compensation program.
In the staff’s view, the rise in mortgage rates since the spring has been restraining
housing activity by more than we had anticipated. Existing home sales fell 5 percent in
the three months ending in October, and the latest readings on pending home sales point
to further weakness in these sales in the coming months. The level of single-family
construction spending in October was below our expectation, and permits in September
and October were also notably weaker than we had anticipated.3 As a result, we now
project the recovery in single-family construction to be somewhat slower than in the
previous Tealbook. Meanwhile, construction in the multifamily sector still appears to
have flattened out this year after rising quickly over the past couple of years. All told, the
growth in real residential investment is expected to slow from an annual rate of about
13 percent in the first half of this year to just 5½ percent in the second half, 4 percentage
points weaker than in the October Tealbook.
2 This projection does not reflect information from the retail sales release published on
December 12.
3 A consequence of the government shutdown is that the Census Bureau will release their estimate
of single-family housing starts for September, October, and November on December 18.

Business Investment u t
O
Real private investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is projected to &
l
increase at a moderate annual rate of 6¼ percent this quarter after rising at a tepid pace e
v
e
earlier in the year. Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in October point to D
n
some pickup in the pace of business equipment outlays this quarter, and survey measures o
c
E
of business conditions in November suggest solid spending increases in the coming c
i
t
months. The near-term trajectory for E&I growth is consistent with the modest pace of e s
m
business output growth since the end of last year. o
D
Averaging through some large quarterly swings, real nonresidential investment
excluding drilling and mining has increased by just 2 percent over the four quarters
ending in the third quarter of this year, as high vacancy rates and tight financing
conditions for new construction continue to curb demand for new buildings. Both the
incoming spending data and indicators like the architectural billings index point toward a
continued sluggish pace of spending for new buildings in the current quarter and early
next year. Meanwhile, increases in real investment in drilling and mining structures
remain robust, supported by high oil prices and new drilling technologies.
Nonfarm inventory investment rose substantially in the third quarter, contributing
1½ percentage points to real GDP growth. This contribution was about ½ percentage
point stronger than we had anticipated at the time of the October Tealbook. We assume
that the pace of nonfarm inventory investment slows a bit in the current quarter and then
flattens out; consequently, inventory investment is a small drag on real GDP growth, on
balance, over the near term. Inventory-to-sales ratios from book-value data and the
staff’s flow-of-goods system, as well as gauges of inventory sentiment from regional and
national manufacturing surveys, do not point to significant inventory imbalances in most
industries.
Government
Real federal purchases declined at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the third
quarter, a smaller decrease than we had anticipated given the sequestration and the
ongoing drawdown in overseas military spending. However, we anticipate that federal
purchases will fall sharply in the current quarter, owing to the effects of the temporary
government shutdown in October as well as the ongoing pressure on federal purchases
from budget restraint. The reversal of the shutdown effects, along with less spending

real federal purchases in the first quarter of next year.
&
l
e
v
In the state and local government sector, the information we have received since e
D
the October Tealbook is consistent with modest increases in real purchases by these n
o
c
governments. State and local employment gains averaged 13,000 per month during the E
c
i
past five months, up from a pace of 2,000 per month over the first half of this year. In t
s
e
m
addition, real state and local construction spending rose robustly in the third quarter after
o
D
declining in the first half of the year, and data for October suggest a further increase this
quarter. Overall, real state and local purchases are projected to increase at an annual rate
of about ½ percent in both the current quarter and the first quarter of next year.
Foreign Trade
After increasing at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the third quarter, real exports
of goods and services are expected to rise 6¾ percent in the current quarter, supported in
part by solid demand from the emerging market economies and consistent with the
strength of the October trade data. We expect the surge in exports to be transitory and
project that exports will step down to a 4¼ percent rate of increase during the first
quarter, a pace more in line with the rate of foreign growth and recent movements in the
dollar. The growth of real imports of goods and services is expected to step up to an
annual rate of 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter of this year, supported by a temporary
leveling off of real oil imports following earlier declines. We expect oil imports to
resume their decline, and, partly as a consequence, we anticipate that real imports will
increase at only a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2014. All told, the external sector
is expected to add about ¼ percentage point to the rate of real GDP growth both in the
current quarter and in the first quarter of next year; this projection is little changed, on
average, from the previous Tealbook.
The Industrial Sector
Manufacturing activity appears to have accelerated this quarter after increasing at
an annual rate of just 1 percent in the third quarter. Factory output rose at a moderate
pace in October, reflecting broad-based production gains across industries, and the
available data for physical products and production worker hours point to a somewhat
larger increase in November. Taking account of the new orders indexes from the latest
manufacturing surveys and automakers’ production schedules, we expect factory output
growth to pick up to an annual rate of 4¾ percent this quarter, 1½ percentage points

THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP D e
n
o
Our forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term is slightly stronger than c
E
in the October Tealbook. The lower projected path for interest rates, the somewhat c
i
t
s
e
higher equity and house prices, and the easing of fiscal restraint because of the recent m
o
budget deal are expected to provide a bit more lift to real output growth than in the D
previous projection. This positive impetus is partly offset by the higher level of the
exchange value of the dollar. All told, the level of real GDP ends the medium-term
projection period a little higher than in the October Tealbook. We now forecast real GDP
growth to step up from 2¼ percent this year to 3 percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in both
2015 and 2016.
Our projection of faster real GDP growth during the next three years continues to
reflect our expectation that a number of the forces that have been holding back the
growth in economic activity in recent years will recede. In particular, we expect the
restraint from changes in federal fiscal policy to wane over time. We also look for
European financial and economic conditions to continue their slow improvement. In
addition, we think that mortgage credit will gradually become more broadly available.
Given the still highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, these developments are
expected to foster a growing sense among households and firms that downside risks to
the recovery have diminished, which should, in turn, reduce asset risk premiums and
provide additional support to consumer spending, business investment, and hiring.
These dynamics are particularly evident in our forecast for consumer spending.
Real PCE is projected to rise 2¼ percent this year and then accelerate to a 3½ percent
pace, on average, over the medium term. This acceleration reflects the fading effects of
this year’s tax increases, gains in household wealth produced by rising house and equity
prices, and improved consumer confidence. Our trajectory for consumer spending in the
medium term is little changed, on net, from the October Tealbook.
Rising income and confidence also are expected to support higher household
formation and thereby boost residential construction, although the effect on home
building will likely be damped by rising mortgage rates. We expect the growth in
residential investment to run at a rate of about 15 percent in 2014 and 2015 before

slowing to about 8 percent in 2016. Our projection is slightly less robust than in the u t
O
October Tealbook, as we have carried forward some of the recent softness in residential
&
investment into next year. However, we have revised up growth in 2015 and 2016; as a e l

result, the level of residential construction activity is still projected to reach its long-run D

Real outlays for E&I are expected to rise 5½ percent per year, on average, over t

the next three years. Although faster than the 2¾ percent pace of growth expected this
o
D
year, our medium-term projection for E&I growth is modest by historical standards and
reflects our expectation that business output will increase at only a moderate pace over
this period. Similarly, we continue to expect only subdued growth in outlays for
nonresidential structures over the medium term.
The external sector is expected to be about neutral for GDP growth in 2014 and
2015 and then to provide a small boost in 2016; on average, these contributions are a bit
smaller than in our previous projection, reflecting the higher path for the dollar. As
foreign growth recovers and the dollar begins to depreciate, we expect real exports to
grow 4¾ percent in 2014 and then to accelerate over the remainder of the forecast period,
reaching a 6¾ percent pace in 2016. Real imports are expected to increase at an average
pace of 4½ percent over the medium term, as the ongoing domestic recovery more than
offsets the restraint from the projected depreciation in the real exchange value of the
dollar.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION
Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook for the Labor Market
We received the labor market reports for both October and November since the
October Tealbook, and these reports were, overall, somewhat stronger than we had been
expecting. Total nonfarm payroll employment growth averaged 200,000 in October and
November, about 50,000 more per month than we had anticipated in the past round.
These readings, combined with the upward revisions to employment in August and
September, leave the level of total payrolls in November about 175,000 higher than our
projection in the previous Tealbook. In the household survey, the unemployment rate has
decreased 0.2 percentage point since September to 7.0 percent in November, whereas we

Forward-looking indicators of labor market activity have generally remained n

market indicators, edged up further in October and November. The hiring plans of small
businesses have increased, on net, from a year ago, and job openings have continued to
edge up over the past few months, although the hiring rate remains relatively flat.
All told, we now expect nonfarm payroll gains of about 185,000 in December and
195,000 per month in the first quarter of next year, about 35,000 more per month than in
the October Tealbook. We have carried forward the lower level of the unemployment
rate and now project it to hold steady at 7.0 percent in December and then gradually
move down to 6.8 percent by March 2014—a path that is 0.2 percentage point lower than
in our October forecast. Similarly, we have adjusted down the path of the labor force
participation rate and now expect that it will remain at its current level of 63.0 percent
through March.
Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment
We have not revised our estimates of potential output or the natural rate of
unemployment in this projection.5 We continue to project that the natural rate of
unemployment will edge down from 5½ percent in 2013 to 5¼ percent in 2015, and we
estimate that potential output will rise by a bit more than 2 percent per year over the
projection period, a slightly faster pace than seen in the past few years. This acceleration
4 We do not believe that the quality of the October payroll survey was materially affected by the
government shutdown. In contrast, the quality of the October household survey may have been impaired
because of the longer-than-usual delay between the reference week and the data collection week. As such,
we believe it is better to compare the November readings in the household survey with their September
values.
5 We have lowered our estimate of trend labor force participation in response to the downside
surprises since the September Tealbook but left our estimate of potential GDP growth unrevised. In effect,
we boosted our assumption for the difference between productivity in the total economy and productivity in
the nonfarm business sector.

The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market e
D
n
Total payroll employment is projected to increase 200,000 per month in 2014 and o
c
then rise 240,000 per month, on average, in 2015 and 2016, a trajectory that is slightly E
c
i
stronger, on net, than in the October Tealbook. As in previous forecasts, the pace of job s t
e
m
gains over the medium term is somewhat less rapid than what the acceleration in real
o
D
GDP would normally imply, reflecting a projected pickup in labor productivity to a pace
more in line with its structural growth rate.
As noted previously, the unemployment rate is 0.2 percentage point lower at the
start of the forecast period as a result of the incoming data. From this lower starting
point, the unemployment rate declines about ½ percentage point per year, thereby
reaching 5¼ percent, the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, at the end
of 2016. We continue to project that the unemployment rate will cross the 6.5 percent
policy threshold around the start of 2015.
Over the four quarters of 2012, the unemployment rate declined 0.9 percentage
point; during 2013, it is projected to decline 0.7 percentage point. During each of the
next three years, the unemployment rate is projected to decline slightly less per year—
0.6 percentage point in each year—despite the fact that real GDP growth is forecast to
run at a faster average pace than in 2012 or 2013. This outlook stems from two
considerations. First, we judge that the natural rate of unemployment was declining a
little more quickly during 2012 and 2013 than it will from here forward; accordingly, the
unemployment rate gap will be closing about as rapidly over the next three years as it has
during the past two years. Second, we judge that between the end of 2011 and the end of
this year, productivity was increasing at a below-trend pace; as a result, the gains in
output that we observed could only be supported by relatively rapid increases in
employment. In contrast, over the next three years, we expect productivity growth to
proceed at its trend pace; therefore, a given increase in GDP will require a smaller gain in
employment, all else being equal.
As shown in the “Labor Market Data and Projections” exhibit, the current
projection for the unemployment rate in mid-2014 is about 1 percentage point lower than
our projection in September 2012, when the Committee first tied its asset purchases to an

The incoming data have led us to narrow our estimate of the unemployment rate
gap by ¼ percentage point at the start of the projection period relative to our forecast in
the October Tealbook, with the unemployment rate 1¾ percentage points above our
estimate of the natural rate. The GDP gap is also a little narrower, with real GDP
currently 3½ percent below potential. These gaps are projected to diminish gradually
over the medium term; by the end of 2016, the unemployment gap is expected to close,
and real GDP is projected to be nearly at its potential level. In the manufacturing sector,
capacity utilization is currently almost 2½ percentage points below its long-run average
but rises to its long-run average by mid-2015.6
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation
After rising at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, total PCE prices are
estimated to increase at just a ¾ percent pace in the fourth quarter, as energy prices
decline and other consumer prices decelerate. Core PCE inflation was 1½ percent in the
third quarter but appears to be running at a rate of only about 1 percent in the fourth
quarter. We project that early next year both total and core PCE inflation will be about
1½ percent.
We have marked down our projection slightly for consumer energy price inflation
in the fourth quarter because of recent movements in the prices of crude oil and refined
products. Overall consumer energy prices are now projected to fall at an annual rate of
5 percent, although we expect this decline will be reversed early next year. Nevertheless,
6 The degree of slack in the manufacturing sector appears to be smaller than that for the broader
economy, in part because of unprecedented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010 that
occurred as manufacturers shuttered plants that had been chronically underutilized. Note that we estimate
capacity in the industrial sector based largely on survey data that seek to capture the highest level of output
that plants can sustainably maintain given sufficient availability of variable inputs, such as labor and
materials.

l
e
v
Consumer food prices are projected to increase at an annual rate of ½ percent this e

quarter and ¾ percent in the first quarter of next year. The subdued pace of food price n
o
c
inflation reflects a bumper domestic crop, which has pushed down prices for food E
c
i
commodities and should continue to restrain food price increases next year. We expect t
s
e
m
PCE food inflation to remain at about ¾ percent in 2014 before rising steadily throughout
o
D
the remainder of the medium term to a pace that is slightly below core inflation.
The data we have received on core PCE prices since the October Tealbook have
been softer than we had anticipated, and our projection for core PCE inflation in the
current quarter has been revised down about ¼ percentage point. Medical services prices
account for part of the recent softness in the core PCE index, as the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services reduced the rate of increase in Medicare reimbursements at the
time of their typical October adjustment by more than we had expected.7 We expect that
reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid will continue to be restrained by tight
government budgets over the next couple of years, and, as a result, we have reduced our
projection for PCE core services inflation a bit to better account for the slowdown in
medical services inflation.
Part of the recent softness of core PCE inflation likely also reflects import prices.
Prices of imported core goods declined at an average annual rate of nearly 3 percent in
the second and third quarters but are expected to increase at about a 1 percent pace in
both the current quarter and the first half of next year. Relative to the October Tealbook,
the projection for the first half of 2014 was revised down by ½ percentage point in
response to the higher dollar. For the remainder of the forecast period, core import price
inflation is expected to run about 1½ percent per year—a pace that would have a roughly
neutral effect on U.S. consumer price inflation—in line with the relatively flat projected
trajectory for commodity prices and our assumed pace of dollar depreciation.
7 In contrast, core CPI inflation has come in closer to our expectations and is little revised since
the previous Tealbook. The CPI price index for medical services focuses on out-of-pocket expenses by
households, while the PCE price index includes all medical services provided to households regardless of
the payer. In particular, although the PCE price index includes prices for Medicare and Medicaid, these
prices are not included in the CPI. The wider scope for medical services in the PCE index leads to a weight
of about 20 percent in core PCE inflation, compared with a weight of only 7 percent in core CPI inflation.

Readings on longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The u t
O
preliminary December reading on median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from
&
the Michigan survey stood at 2.8 percent, well within the relatively narrow range seen in e l
v
e
recent years. Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by D
n
the Survey of Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2 percent in the fourth quarter. o
c
E
Similarly, TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation are little changed,
c
i
t
on balance, since the October Tealbook. s
e
m
o
D
With stable long-run inflation expectations, a projected pickup in commodity and
import prices next year, and gradually diminishing margins of slack, we expect core PCE
inflation to increase from just over 1 percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 2016; this forecast
is essentially the same as in the October Tealbook. Given the trajectory for energy
prices, total PCE inflation is projected to be a bit below core inflation over the medium
term. Thus, through 2016, the PCE inflation projection remains below the Committee’s
long-run objective of 2 percent.
The incoming data suggest that labor compensation has continued to rise
modestly. We now estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector
will increase at a 2 percent annual rate in the current quarter—close to the average rate
seen over the past two years. We expect the gradual tightening of the labor market over
the medium term to push hourly compensation growth up to 3½ percent by 2016.
Also, see the box “Tealbook Forecast Errors over the Recovery So Far” for a
discussion of the recent errors in the staff’s forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and
inflation.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the
FRB/US model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy,
and other factors. The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key
assumptions:
 The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates through 2017, albeit to a diminishing

O Tealbook Forecast Errors over the Recovery So Far
&
l
e
v In 2009 and 2010, staff forecasts of real GDP growth were too optimistic, while our
e
D forecasts of the unemployment rate were relatively accurate. Starting in 2011,
n
o circumstances have reversed: Our forecasts of real GDP have thus far proven quite
c
E accurate, while we were not able to anticipate the extent of the decline in the
c
i unemployment rate that has taken place. Responding to this constellation of forecast
t
s
e errors, we have substantially downgraded our assessment of the supply side of the
m
o economy. Meanwhile, inflation in 2011 and 2012 came in well above the staff’s
D
expectations; in 2013, by contrast, we have been surprised by how low inflation has been.
In this box we present and discuss these recent forecast errors.
Staff projections for the level of real GDP from the current and past four December
Tealbooks are plotted in the left panel of figure 1. The solid red and dashed orange lines
show the overly optimistic projections made by the staff in 2009 and 2010. In mid-2010 and
mid-2011, the BEA released revised estimates of real GDP that painted a considerably darker
picture of the severity of the recession and the immediate post-recession period, and the
staff substantially marked down its GDP forecast in 2011. Since then, revisions to the
projected level of real GDP have been relatively minor.
The right-hand panel presents the same information in growth-rate terms, and rather than
focusing on the year in which the forecast was made, it focuses instead on the year in
which the economic outcome took place. The gray bars in this panel show the currently
published Q4/Q4 percent changes in real GDP in 2010, 2011, and 2012, while the red dots,
blue squares, and green triangles over each bar show forecasts for growth that year from
December Tealbooks two years prior, one year prior, and the contemporaneous year,
respectively. The whisker bands around the dots, squares, and triangles demarcate
approximate 70 percent confidence bands using staff forecast errors over the past

20 years.1 Unusually large forecast errors are represented by cases where the top of a gray O
&
bar (the actual value) falls outside one of the whisker bands, as was true for the two-year-
l
ahead projections for growth in 2011 and 2012, both too high by an unusually large e
v
e
2½ percentage points (p.p.). Attempts to identify the cause of these forecast errors are D
fraught with uncertainty, but the current GDP data show that PCE is the category that n
o
contributed most to these two-year-ahead forecast misses (about 1 p.p. to the 2011 GDP c
E
growth miss and 1½ p.p. to the 2012 miss). Growth in real PCE may have been held down c
i
t
s
by a surge in energy prices in 2011, which acted like a tax on consumers, contributing to e
m
lower-than-expected real disposable personal income.2 o
D
The left panel of figure 2 shows the staff’s forecasts of the unemployment rate from the
current and past four December Tealbooks. The overly pessimistic projections in
December 2011 and December 2012 are particularly striking; in each case, the
unemployment rate was ¾ p.p. lower one year later than the staff had projected. These
larger-than-expected declines in the unemployment rate in the face of only modest
measured GDP growth led the staff to substantially mark down its estimates of potential
GDP, leading to a sizable narrowing of the estimated GDP gap despite only minor revisions
to real GDP since 2011 (see the right panel of figure 2). Even conditional on our revised
potential output path, the unemployment rate has declined somewhat more than we
would have expected based on GDP growth alone. In our current view, possible
explanations for that development might include excessive, panicked firing in 2009
followed by subsequent normalization in the labor market; measurement error in GDP
1
These bands are plus or minus the root mean square error of the forecast for each horizon over the
past 20 years, so an implicit assumption has been made here that forecast errors follow a normal
distribution. Other procedures yield somewhat different error bands.
2
Among other expenditures categories, government purchases contributed about 1 p.p. to the
forecast miss for 2011, as defense spending and state and local purchases fell much more sharply than
expected. The contribution to the GDP forecast error from overall fiscal policy was smaller than that from
government purchases, as the federal government unexpectedly put in place a payroll tax cut in 2011 that
we think boosted aggregate demand somewhat.

o
c In both 2011 and 2012, inflation came in higher than the staff had projected earlier; indeed,
E
c the one- and two-year-ahead forecast errors for both total and core PCE price inflation in
i
t
e s 2011 were unusually large, as was the two-year-ahead core inflation forecast error for 2012.
m
These forecast misses appear to be due to a mix of factors. First, higher-than-anticipated
o
D
oil prices contributed to the errors in overall inflation. This oil-price surprise probably
contributed to the errors in core inflation as well, as did larger-than-expected increases in
other commodity and import prices. More broadly, there may have been less downward
pressure from slack (as can be seen from the errors in our projections of resource
utilization), less persistence in the inflation process, and greater anchoring of inflation
expectations than we had earlier assumed.
However, for 2013, both inflation measures now appear likely to come in somewhat lower
than we had earlier projected. The ½ p.p. downward revision over the past year to our
estimate of core PCE inflation in 2013 likely stems from several factors, including a stronger
exchange value of the dollar than we had projected and surprising weakness in both the
PCE measure of medical prices and the nonmedical portion of the non-market-based prices.

 The natural rate of unemployment is 5¼ percent, and potential GDP rises
around 2¼ percent per year from 2017 to 2020.
The economy is projected to enter 2017 with output at its potential level and
unemployment at its natural rate, but with inflation below the long-run objective of the
Committee. In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in household and
business confidence and credit availability, in conjunction with diminishing uncertainty,
enable real GDP to rise nearly 2¾ percent in 2017. As a result, real GDP moves slightly
above potential and the unemployment rate declines a bit below the natural rate; these
small gaps are eventually closed as monetary policy accommodation is progressively
withdrawn. Long-run inflation expectations are assumed to remain well anchored, and,
with slack in labor and product markets having been eliminated, consumer price inflation
moves up to 2 percent by 2019. The nominal federal funds rate rises gradually from
about 2 percent at the end of 2016 to 4 percent by 2020.8

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign economic activity is pulling out of a protracted soft patch. Real GDP
growth picked up to 3 percent in the third quarter after averaging only about 2 percent for
more than a year, and recent indicators are pointing to another 3 percent expansion in the
fourth quarter. Europe is emerging from its long recession, China’s growth has recovered
from a slowdown in the first half of the year, and the Mexican economy has rebounded
from a second-quarter contraction. Foreign GDP growth is expected to average
3¼ percent next year and then level off near 3½ percent through 2016. This outlook is a
k
o
little stronger in the current quarter than in the October Tealbook and not much changed o
l
t
u
thereafter. O
&
l
With activity throughout the advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs) e
v
e
accelerating simultaneously, there is some chance that positive synergies could result in D
n
stronger global growth than we have projected in our baseline. At the same time, o
c
E
however, some of the downside risks we have previously identified have not gone away. l
’
t
n
Europe continues to face daunting economic and political challenges, which could result I
in a resurgence of financial turmoil and possibly a triple-dip recession. And financial
stresses in some EMEs became a little more pronounced over the intermeeting period.
Although not the most likely outcome, such stresses could snowball into a broader EME
crisis, a scenario explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) is estimated to have fallen to
just ½ percent in the current quarter, nearly 1 percentage point lower than we had
predicted. Although recent softness in retail prices for energy and other commodities
contributed to the decline, core inflation also decreased somewhat. With inflation below
central bank targets and substantial resource slack remaining, we expect monetary policy
in the AFEs to remain expansionary. Monetary policy moves have been more divergent
across the EMEs. Although some central banks have recently cut policy rates to support
growth, in some of the more vulnerable EMEs, including Brazil, India, and Indonesia,
policy rates have been raised to contain inflationary pressures and curtail currency
depreciation.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
We expect real GDP growth in the AFEs to remain about 2 percent in the current
quarter for the third consecutive quarter, as the euro area continues its slow exit from
recession while the other economies expand at a more robust pace. Growth is expected to
edge up to just 2¼ percent over the forecast period, with a significant further recovery in
the euro area partly offset by a slowing of Japan’s expansion from its rapid 2013 pace.
Outside of Japan, AFE inflation has declined significantly in recent months,
raising concerns that disinflation could depress expectations and ultimately turn into
k
o outright deflation. Indeed, persistent weakness in core inflation, especially in Canada and
o
l
t
u the euro area, has led us to mark down our forecast for inflation a touch going forward.
O
& However, our sense is that the current low rates of inflation are consistent with resource
l
e slack and declines in retail energy prices. With output gaps projected to shrink over the
v
e
D forecast period, we expect AFE inflation to rise gradually, reaching 1¾ percent in 2016.
n
o
c
E With inflation well below targets, we expect monetary policy in most economies
l
’
t
n to be a little more accommodative than previously assumed. Following a surprise policy
I
rate cut to 0.25 percent in early November, we expect the European Central Bank (ECB)
to refrain from tightening until early 2016, two quarters later than we had previously
assumed. We also pushed back the Bank of Canada’s (BOC) first policy rate hike by two
quarters and built in an assumption that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will increase the pace of
its asset purchases starting in the second quarter of next year. We continue to expect the
Bank of England (BOE) to hold rates steady until late 2015.
Euro Area
The euro-area economy emerged from recession in the second quarter with
growth of 1.2 percent, boosted by some transitory factors, then slowed as expected to a
meager ¼ percent in the third quarter. Export growth dropped following a surge in the
second quarter, while final domestic demand again grew only modestly. Recent
indicators suggest that growth will remain sluggish in the current quarter at an estimated
rate of ¾ percent. In October, euro-area retail sales declined and industrial production
fell in most euro-area countries. In addition, the composite PMI edged lower in both
October and November. We expect a gradual improvement in the pace of expansion to
1¼ percent in 2014 and about 2 percent in 2015 and 2016 as financial conditions ease
Page 38 of 94

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 12, 2013
further, monetary policy remains accommodative, and the pace of fiscal consolidation
diminishes.
Recent data suggest that euro-area headline inflation fell below an annual rate of
1 percent in the current quarter, mostly because of a decline in retail energy prices, and
that core inflation moderated to roughly 1 percent. Inflation expectations also have edged
down. In response, we lowered our forecast slightly, although we still expect inflation to
increase to 1¼ percent in 2014 and to 1½ percent in 2015 and 2016 as the recovery gains
traction. In addition to the surprise rate cut at its November meeting, the ECB
subsequently signaled that it still has scope for further cuts in the policy rate, as well as
k
for unconventional policy easing. However, our sense is that as long as growth and o
o
l
t
inflation do not dip below our current forecast, the ECB would find such options u
O
unpalatable. Accordingly, we have assumed that the policy interest rate will remain at &
l
0.25 percent through 2015 and will increase to 0.75 percent over the course of 2016. e

e
D
United Kingdom n

c
E
Real GDP rose a robust 3.2 percent in the third quarter, continuing its recent
l
’
t
strong performance. Growth was considerably faster than we had projected, driven by a n
I
pickup in domestic demand, while exports fell. Recent data, including strong PMI
readings in all sectors and improving business confidence, led us to raise our estimate for
the current quarter by ½ percentage point to 3 percent, and we also carried some of this
strength forward. We now project growth to average 2¾ percent in 2014 and 2½ percent
in 2015 and 2016.
We had expected inflation of 3 percent in the current quarter as increases in
tuition fees continue to be phased in. However, October data indicated that the effect of
this year’s increase in tuition fees was considerably smaller than last year’s, while
transport costs fell. As a result, we cut our forecast of current-quarter inflation to
1½ percent. With sizable economic slack eroding only gradually, we expect inflation to
remain moderate over the forecast period, averaging 2 percent. We thus continue to
project that the BOE will not raise the Bank Rate until the fourth quarter of 2015 and will
maintain the current size of its asset purchase program into 2016. The latest BOE
forecast suggested that the unemployment rate would hit 7 percent—the BOE’s threshold
to consider raising rates—much earlier than it had indicated in August. This change
brought the BOE’s unemployment rate forecast closer to our own projection, and so we
Page 39 of 94

--- Page 43 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 12, 2013
did not alter our assumptions for BOE policy. The BOE has continued to stress that
crossing the threshold would not necessarily trigger a rate hike.
Japan
After surging 4 percent in the first half of this year on Abenomics-inspired
increases in consumer confidence, fiscal stimulus, and declines in the yen, real GDP
growth slowed to 1 percent in the third quarter as exports dipped and household spending
moderated. However, real merchandise exports bounced back in October, and the
composite PMI through November points to rapid expansion. Accordingly, we expect
GDP growth to rebound to an average of 4 percent this quarter and next, supported by
k
o
o higher household spending ahead of a consumption tax hike scheduled for April. Growth
l
t
u
O should then fall back and average about 1 percent over the remainder of the forecast
& period, as the ending of previously enacted fiscal stimulus measures along with
l
e
v forthcoming consumption tax increases are only partly offset by some new business tax
e
D
cuts and additional public spending. Nevertheless, with potential growth at only about
n
o
c ½ percent, the output gap shrinks over the forecast period.
E
l
’
t
n
I In contrast to the other AFEs, core inflation picked up in Japan in October,
prompting us to revise our forecast of fourth-quarter inflation up a bit to 1 percent. We
expect inflation (excluding the direct impact of the tax hikes) to average ¾ percent in
2014, 1¼ percent in 2015, and 1¾ percent in 2016, still slightly below the BOJ’s
2 percent target. With inflation rising only slowly toward that target, and in line with
recent indications from policymakers, we now assume that the BOJ will step up the pace
of its already substantial asset purchases beginning in the second quarter of 2014.
Canada
Real GDP growth in Canada rebounded to 2.7 percent in the third quarter from
1.6 percent in the second, when it had been restrained by temporary factors that included
flooding in Alberta and Toronto. We expect GDP growth to step down to about
2¼ percent in the fourth quarter before rising to 2½ percent in 2014 and 2¾ percent in the
following two years, supported by improvement in U.S. activity.
Headline inflation slowed sharply in October, largely as a result of a surprisingly
steep drop in gasoline prices. With energy prices lower than previously expected, we
marked down our current-quarter inflation forecast by 1½ percentage points to only
¼ percent. Core inflation also has been persistently low in recent months. Going
Page 40 of 94

--- Page 44 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 12, 2013
forward, we expect inflation to edge up as economic activity firms, but to not reach the
BOC’s 2 percent target until 2016. This path is a little lower than in our previous
forecast. Given our outlook for lower inflation along with still-high unemployment, we
now project that the BOC will keep its main policy rate unchanged until the first quarter
of 2015.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
Real GDP growth in the EMEs picked up to 4 percent in the third quarter from
3 percent in the second, reflecting a rebound of Mexican economic activity from its
second-quarter contraction along with a pickup in China. Recent indicators suggest that k
o
o
EME growth will edge up to 4¼ percent in the current quarter. We expect the pace of t l
u
O
expansion to pick up a little more to an average of 4½ percent over the remainder of the
&
forecast period, about its trend rate, supported by firming activity in the advanced l
e
v
economies. This projection is a little stronger in the current quarter than in the previous e
D
forecast, reflecting stronger-than-expected data for both China and Mexico, and is little n
o
c
changed thereafter. E
l
’
t
n
I
We estimate that aggregate EME inflation picked up to 3¾ percent in the current
quarter, largely reflecting a rise in Mexican inflation, as food prices reversed their earlier
declines. Afterward, inflation is expected to moderate to 3¼ percent. Over the
intermeeting period, the central banks of Brazil, India, and Indonesia raised their policy
rates further to contain inflation and support their currencies. In contrast, the central
banks of Chile, Mexico, and Thailand eased monetary policy to support growth.
China
Recent indicators suggest that the economy continued to expand briskly in the
current quarter, at a pace of about 8½ percent, up ½ percentage point from the October
Tealbook. Although investment growth moderated in October and November, industrial
production and retail sales growth remained robust, while exports strengthened. We
continue to expect a gradual slowing of growth to 7½ percent by 2016, reflecting both a
decline in trend growth as well as our belief that the authorities will be reining in credit
expansion, particularly in the shadow banking sector. Credit growth slowed somewhat in
October and November and interbank interest rates moved up, as the People’s Bank of
China appeared to shift toward a somewhat less accommodative monetary policy stance.

We estimate that consumer price inflation registered 3½ percent in the current
quarter, up from earlier in the year, reflecting a temporary increase in food prices.
Inflation is expected to fall back to about 3 percent next quarter and remain at this rate
throughout the forecast period.
In mid-November, Chinese leaders agreed on an ambitious blueprint for reform
aimed at increasing the role of markets in the economy. The plans are largely in line with
our assumption of gradual liberalization of markets and further progress in moving away
from heavy dependence on the external sector, and should help sustain growth and
decrease the likelihood of a disruptive financial crisis. (See the box “China’s Reform

n
I indicators for activity in the current quarter, including PMIs, exports, and industrial
production, suggest that growth is continuing to average about 4 percent. Growth would
be higher if not for the effect of November’s Typhoon Haiyan on Philippine GDP. We
anticipate that the Philippine economy will make up its lost ground early next year, with
growth getting a boost from reconstruction efforts. We also marked down fourth-quarter
growth in Thailand somewhat in response to the recent political unrest. We expect real
GDP growth in the region to remain at 4 percent through the first half of 2014 and to rise
to 4½ percent thereafter.
We estimate that consumer price inflation was again close to 4 percent in the
current quarter, up from the first half of the year, reflecting pass-through of earlier
currency depreciations and, in some countries, higher food prices. These effects should
dissipate next quarter, and we project that inflation will decline to 3½ percent over the
next three years.
Latin America
Mexico’s real GDP rebounded more strongly than we had expected from its
second-quarter contraction, increasing at a 3½ percent rate in the third quarter. Sizable
gains in exports and government expenditures contributed to this expansion. Growth is

expected to remain at 3½ percent in the current quarter, marked up from the previous
forecast in part because of upward revisions to U.S. manufacturing activity, and to stay at
about that pace over the next three years.
Inflation in Mexico is estimated to have risen from 2 percent in the third quarter
to 4 percent in the current quarter as earlier food price declines were reversed. Next
quarter, tax increases are expected to push inflation up further to 4¾ percent. However,
headline inflation should fall back to 3½ percent thereafter, within the central bank’s
target band of 2 to 4 percent.
k
After surging more than 7 percent in the second quarter, Brazilian real GDP o
o
contracted 2 percent in the third quarter, a weaker outcome than we had expected, with t l
u
O
declines in both investment and exports. Recent data on exports, as well as the
&
manufacturing PMI and confidence indicators, have been more positive, and we expect l
e
v
growth to pick up in the current quarter to 1¼ percent. But this expansion is still quite e
D
weak, as the economy is being held back by ongoing financial stresses and sluggish n
o
c
demand for commodities. As financial conditions slowly improve and global recovery E
l
’
t
continues, we should see some pickup in growth to 3 percent next year and 3½ percent in n
I
2015 and 2016.
We estimate that Brazilian inflation rose to 5½ percent in the current quarter,
reflecting the pass-through of real depreciation and a pickup in food price inflation in
October. These pressures should abate next year, allowing inflation to moderate to
5¼ percent by the end of 2014. Citing concerns over inflationary pressures, Brazil’s
central bank has continued to tighten monetary policy, with November’s 50 basis point
increase in the main policy rate, to 10 percent, bringing the cumulative increase in the
rate to 275 basis points since April.

China’s Reform Agenda
On November 15, the Communist Party of China (CPC) unveiled an ambitious
blueprint for economic reform, reflecting decisions made at the Third Plenum of
the 18th CPC Central Committee. Third Plenums, which are held every five years,
have historically been used to set out the new leadership’s policy agenda and
have occasionally—for example, in 1978 and 1993—heralded major market
reforms. This year’s document calls for sweeping reforms long thought
necessary to enhance the role of markets in the economy, help address
worrisome imbalances, and improve prospects for sustainable economic
k growth.1
o
o
l
t
u
The document gives emphasis to strengthening the foundations of the market-
O
& based economy, notably by according a “decisive” role to the market in
l allocating resources (an upgrade from the “basic” role in previous reform
e
v
e documents) and advocating a more limited role for government in the economy.
D
The reforms highlighted include the following:
n
o
c
E • Financial reforms to improve financial access and promote a more
l
’
t efficient use of capital, including gradually liberalizing interest rates,
n
I
introducing deposit insurance, developing domestic capital markets,
moving toward a market-based exchange rate regime, liberalizing the
capital account, and opening up services sectors such as finance, health
care, and education to foreign investment.
• Fiscal reforms to reduce local governments’ reliance on transfers from
higher levels of government and lessen incentives to raise revenue via
land sales and opaque off-balance-sheet borrowing vehicles. The
reforms would centralize some government spending responsibility
(which currently resides mostly with local governments), provide local
governments with more taxing authority, allow local governments to
issue debt, and improve transparency in local government finances.
• Labor and land reforms to facilitate urbanization and address growing
social inequities. Reforms in this area include easing restrictions on
migration of rural residents to urban areas and reducing farmers’
vulnerability to land expropriation by strengthening their property rights.
• Natural resource pricing reforms to encourage a more efficient use of
water, oil, natural gas, and electricity and thus reduce the energy
intensity of China’s growth.
• Reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to improve corporate
governance practices, create state-owned asset management companies
focused on maximizing returns, and allocate more SOE profits to social
1
The formal title of the document is “The Decision on Major Issues Concerning
Comprehensively Deepening Reforms.” An abbreviated version of the document is available in
English at www.china.org.cn/china/third_plenary_session/2013-11/16/content_30620736.htm.

spending. These reforms have generally been perceived to be among
the least ambitious on the agenda; notably, the document fails to
mention reducing barriers to entry in “strategic” and “pillar” industries,
such as telecommunications, which are currently shielded from
competition. That said, other reforms, such as moving toward market-
based prices for natural resources and liberalizing interest rates, would
likely force changes on SOEs indirectly.
• Other reforms include those for governance such as cracking down on
corruption and waste and relaxing the one-child policy for families.
Although this latter policy has received much attention, it is less
consequential than it might appear, as it only applies to families in which
one or both of the parents is a single child.
k
o
o
l
Most of these reform initiatives have been articulated before, and some t
u
O
(including several of the financial reforms) are already under way. But the
&
comprehensive range and decidedly pro-market tone of the plenum’s agenda has
l
e
strengthened the perception that the current leadership both recognizes what v
e
reforms are needed and intends to implement them. D
n
o
Timely and successful implementation of these reforms remains an open c
E
question, however, and will require strong coordinated action from the party l
’
t
n
leadership. Encouragingly, oversight of the implementation of the reform
I
agenda will be chaired by President Xi Jinping himself, who appears to carry more
weight in the party than some of his predecessors. His oversight may help
counter resistance at various levels of government. Moreover, President Xi
benefits from the support of other reform-minded officials, notably Premier Li
Keqiang, who heads the State Council, the highest executive body. Reformers
also head some of the most important government departments, including the
People’s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance.
The timeline for reforms remains vague; the document states only that “decisive
results are to be obtained in key areas in 2020.” We continue to expect gradual
and cautious implementation of the reform agenda, particularly in areas where
vested interests are more formidable (for example, SOEs), where technical
barriers are significant (for example, developing rural land markets), and where
financial stability concerns come into play (for example, revamping local
government finances).
Overall, the Third Plenum’s reform agenda is a welcome development. Its
implementation would both support continued rapid economic expansion in the
coming years, albeit at a decelerating pace, and decrease the likelihood of a
disruptive financial crisis. Since we had already factored in several of the reforms
and still believe that it will take some time for them to bear fruit, the agenda has
not led us to alter our forecast. The announced agenda does give us more
confidence, though, that the authorities will indeed carry out these reforms over
time and thus increases the conviction with which we hold our baseline outlook.

Financial Developments
Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were driven largely
by incoming data on employment and economic activity that exceeded investor
expectations as well as by Federal Reserve communications. On balance, market
participants moved closer their expected timing of the first reduction in the pace of asset
purchases but continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would remain low for a
substantial time. The yield curve steepened over the period, equity prices moved up, and
spreads on corporate bonds narrowed somewhat. The dollar appreciated against most
other currencies.
• Responses to the December Survey of Primary Dealers indicate that the
perceived probability of a reduction in the pace of purchases at the upcoming
meeting has risen significantly since the October survey. However, the
median anticipated date for the first reduction in asset purchases remains
March 2014.
• The expected path of the federal funds rate priced into derivatives markets
was little changed through the end of 2015, but it became somewhat steeper
thereafter. The two-year Treasury yield was about unchanged, whereas the s
t

10-year yield rose 30 basis points. e

purchases at its December meeting, though analysts remained uncertain and divided in
their views on this question. In addition, the October FOMC statement and minutes
reportedly were viewed as indicating that the Committee’s stance on asset purchases
would be a touch less accommodative than previously expected.
The December Survey of Primary Dealers indicates that dealers now place
probabilities of 25 percent and 18 percent on a reduction at the upcoming meeting in the
pace of Treasury and MBS purchases, respectively. At the time of the October survey,
the probabilities were around 10 percent. For the January and March meetings,
respondents place probabilities of 27 percent and 30 percent, respectively, on a first
reduction in the pace of either Treasury or MBS purchases; the reported probability for
March is about 5 percentage points lower than at the time of the October survey.
Nonetheless, by a relatively slim margin, the median anticipated date for the first
reduction in asset purchases remains March 2014.
Market participants, however, did not appear to interpret these developments as
suggesting an earlier liftoff of the federal funds rate. A variety of Federal Reserve
communications—including other language in the October FOMC minutes, Vice Chair
Yellen’s confirmation testimony, and the Chairman’s speech at the National Economists
Club—were seen as strengthening the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal
funds rate. Two research papers by senior Federal Reserve staff members may have s
t
n
reinforced this development. Respondents to the primary dealer survey anticipate that the e
m
p
most likely timing of the first increase in the target rate has shifted to the fourth quarter of o

straight read of OIS quotes moved only slightly since the October meeting, and
uncertainty about short-term rates two- to three-years ahead, proxied by swaption implied
volatilities, inched up.2 The expected federal funds rate path further out rose somewhat,
and the Treasury yield curve steepened, with the 2-year Treasury yield about unchanged
1 In the flash survey conducted after the June 2013 FOMC meeting, respondents anticipated that
the most likely timing of the first increase in the target rate was the second quarter of 2015.

qualitatively similar behavior of the expected path of the short rate.

and 5- and 10-year yields higher by 16 and 30 basis points, respectively.3 The staff term
structure models suggest that more than half of the rise in the 10-year yield was due to an
increase in term premiums, consistent with a shift in asset purchase expectations
influencing the long end of the curve and a modest rise in interest rate uncertainty.
The TIPS-based measure of 5-year inflation compensation dipped 13 basis points,
while the 5-year forward measure was unchanged. The 30-year current-coupon agency
MBS yield increased a bit more than the 10-year Treasury yield.
Consistent with the generally better-than-expected news regarding economic
activity, stock prices moved up 2 percent, on net, and some broad equity price indexes
touched all-time highs during the period. As discussed in greater detail in the December
QS assessment, aggregate ratios of broad equity price indexes to forward earnings
measures are generally not far above their historical median values, while valuations in
some segments of the stock market—including small firms in the high-tech sector—
appear stretched. Both near- and far-term spreads of yields on corporate bonds to those
on Treasury securities of comparable maturity narrowed somewhat over the intermeeting
period.
BUSINESS FINANCE
s
Business finance flows were robust over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting n t
e
m
in part a growing comfort with the economic outlook as well as the resolution of the
p
o
uncertainty surrounding the fiscal standoff. Total funds raised through seasoned and l
e
v
initial public offerings by the nonfinancial corporate sector in October and November e
D
reached levels not seen in a decade. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations a l
i
c
picked up again after a dip related to the fiscal standoff, and a larger amount of n
a
n
speculative-grade issuance was earmarked for investment spending, leveraged buyouts i
F
(LBOs), and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Similarly, institutional issuance of
leveraged loans rose in October, boosted by a number of M&A and LBO transactions,
and remained solid in November. CLO issuance was also robust.
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets were also
consistent with increased investor confidence. Year-to-date CMBS issuance is 80 percent
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 8 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

higher than the equivalent measure for 2012, although issuance remains well below the
levels seen before the financial crisis. Responses to the December 2013 Senior Credit
Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) suggest that demand for
funding for CMBS has picked up since September. CRE loans on banks’ books
expanded in October and November at an increasing pace, and third-quarter Call Report
data indicate that construction and land development loans, generally the riskiest types of
CRE loans, registered their first significant increase in five years.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Auto loans continued to expand in October, and bank credit data suggest that this
trend was sustained in November. Data from credit bureau records indicate that these
loans are broadly available, including to consumers with subprime credit histories. Auto
ABS issuance accelerated in November, and, within the category, issuance of paper
backed by subprime auto loans stayed strong. As discussed in the QS assessment,
although underwriting standards applied to loans included in recent subprime auto ABS
deals appear to have slipped a touch, overall credit enhancement appears adequate. In
contrast to conditions in the auto loan market, credit card balances, measured on a year-
over-year basis, continued to move sideways, and ABS issuance in the sector has stayed
flat.
s
t
In the mortgage finance market, market sources reported that several large lenders n
e
m
eased their mortgage underwriting standards slightly, but aggregate data through p
o
September suggest that lenders continue to be reluctant to extend credit to borrowers with e l
v
e
less-than-pristine credit scores. Mortgage rates increased about 30 basis points over the D
l
intermeeting period and are about 100 basis points above their early-May lows. On a
i
c
n
balance, refinance applications hovered roughly 65 percent below their early-May level, a
n
i
while purchase applications have declined only 13 percent. Banks’ holdings of closed- F
end residential real estate loans in November ran off for the fifth consecutive month, as
mortgage originations, which were held down by the sharp drop in refinancing, were
outpaced by sales to the government-sponsored enterprises of loans held on balance
sheet, reflecting the usual lag between loan originations and sales. House prices as
measured by the CoreLogic index rose significantly in October, but other indicators
suggest that the pace of house price gains continues to decelerate relative to its pace at the
beginning of the year.

TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury market remained close to long-term average
levels. Agency MBS market liquidity continued to show some further signs of
improvement from the challenged levels seen this summer, with some measures returning
to near their average levels for most of the current MBS purchase program. Dollar-roll-
implied financing rates for main production coupon agency MBS securities stayed near
their recent high levels, reflecting limited settlement pressures.4 Since the October
FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned $225 billion of nominal coupon
securities and $13 billion of TIPS.5
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets have been generally stable since
the October FOMC meeting. The Open Market Desk continued to conduct daily,
overnight, fixed-rate, capped-allotment reverse repurchase operations as part of an
operational readiness exercise and gradually raised the offered rate to 5 basis points, the
maximum rate authorized by the FOMC.6
Responses to the December SCOOS generally showed little change in dealer-
intermediated financing since September. Credit terms applicable to most classes of
counterparties were little changed. One-third of respondents reported a decline in the use
of financial leverage by trading real estate investment trusts, whereas the use of leverage
s
t
by other classes of counterparties was unchanged. Despite reports of an uptick in the n
e
m
financing of longer-duration assets since September, the current use of repo and other p
o
similar financing for longer-duration assets was roughly in line with or somewhat below e l
v
e
the levels seen early in 2013. D

4 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $68 billion of Treasury securities under the n a
i
flow-based Treasury purchase program and $78 billion of agency MBS under the flow-based MBS F
program and the reinvestment program. In addition, the Federal Reserve began an exercise consisting of a
series of small-value purchase and sale operations of agency MBS via FedTrade. Although only purchases
have been tested to date, sales will be conducted as well; gross operations through January will not exceed
$500 million.
5 The Treasury will conduct its initial auction of floating-rate notes in late January 2014, which
represents the first introduction of a new type of Treasury security in 17 years. The floating-rate notes will
have a maturity of two years and will pay a variable interest rate composed of an index rate equal to the
high rate of the most recently issued 13-week Treasury bill and a spread that is determined at auction.
6 In addition, over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve conducted a 28-day, fixed-rate,
full-allotment term deposit operation at an interest rate of 26 basis points. The operation, as part of
ongoing operational readiness exercises, resulted in an award of $13½ billion in term deposits, marking the
largest such operation to date.

BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY
Bank credit rose slightly in October and November, as the growth in C&I, CRE,
and consumer loans was partially offset by declines in holdings of residential mortgages
on banks’ balance sheets. According to the November Survey of Terms of Business
Lending, interest rates and loan rate spreads on newly originated C&I loans declined over
the past three months, likely in part because of the ongoing elevated competition for such
loans. Stock prices for large and regional domestic banking firms outperformed the
broad equity market over the intermeeting period, rising about 4½ percent amid better-
than-expected economic data and the settlement of mortgage-related litigation by some
large banking organizations. CDS spreads for the largest bank holding companies
declined relative to a broad index of liquid CDS referencing investment-grade firms.
After a brisk advance in October, M2 growth contracted in November as market
conditions normalized following the fiscal standoff and investors reallocated out of cash
positions. Notably, institutional money fund investors and money funds themselves
appeared to reallocate out of bank deposits following the fiscal deal, reversing the
increases seen during the debt ceiling impasse. The monetary base continued to expand
rapidly in November, primarily reflecting the increase in reserve balances resulting from
the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases.

pace of Federal Reserve asset purchases. The dollar appreciated 6¼ percent against the
Brazilian real and 7½ percent against the Indonesian rupiah. Bond yields in these
economies rose sharply, with long-term Brazilian local currency yields increasing

150 basis points. In addition, most emerging market equity indexes fell, on net, over the
period, even though they reacted favorably to the outcome of China’s Third Plenum (see
the IEDO box “China’s Reform Agenda”).
Prompted by lower-than-expected inflation in the euro area, which fell in October
to its lowest level in four years, the European Central Bank (ECB) surprised markets by
cutting its main refinancing rate 25 basis points to ¼ percent, sooner than had been
expected. Since the meeting, several ECB policymakers have noted possibilities for
further easing in the euro area, including cutting the main refinancing rate further,
lowering the rate paid at the ECB’s deposit facility into negative territory, and conducting
a new longer-term refinancing operation. These factors likely restrained the increase
over the period in German long-term sovereign yields, which rose only 8 basis points,
compared with increases of nearly 30 basis points in comparable U.K. and U.S. yields.
Major headline equity prices in the euro area and the United Kingdom fell
1¾ percent and 3½ percent, on net, respectively. In contrast, Japan’s Nikkei index rose
9 percent amid the weakening of the yen and large foreign purchases of Japanese
equities.
Foreign private investors, on net, sold a sizable amount of Treasury bills in
October, perhaps reflecting concerns over the fiscal standoff. However, demand for
s
t
n
Treasury securities by foreign official investors remained strong, especially for longer- e
m
term bonds and notes. More recent data on custody holdings at the FRBNY suggest that p

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable volatility.1 We see a
number of risks attending our forecast for economic activity, including those posed by the
possibility that the extent of supply-side damage to the economy since the recession has
been greater than we have assumed, that the tightening in mortgage rates since last spring
will continue to exert greater restraint on the recovery in the housing sector than we have
projected, and that economic and financial stresses in emerging market economies
(EMEs) or the euro area will intensify. In addition, we see neither monetary policy nor
fiscal policy as being well positioned to help the economy weather any future adverse
shocks. Given these considerations, we continue to believe that the risks to our forecast
for real GDP growth are skewed to the downside. However, we view the risks around
our projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher
unemployment rate from adverse demand-side developments roughly countered by the
possibility that the unemployment rate continues to surprise us to the downside as it has
in recent years.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook has been informed by the staff’s
recently completed quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which concluded that the
vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks has remained at moderate levels
overall, with mixed and largely offsetting changes over the fall. The moderate level of
vulnerability reflects the relatively strong capital profiles of large domestic banking
firms, the low levels and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the nonfinancial sectors,
and some progress in ongoing efforts to reduce reliance on fragile short-term wholesale
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past
y
several years. In particular, as the fixed 20-year window used to assess the size of typical forecast errors t
n
has moved forward to include the experience of the past five years, the estimated standard errors for out- a i
t
year projections of the unemployment rate and real GDP growth increased between 2008 and 2011, almost e r
c
doubling for unemployment and increasing by about 50 percent for GDP growth, and have remained at n
U
these higher levels with the current 20-year sample. As a result, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty
&
about economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great Moderation period. In
s
contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged relative to earlier k
s
sample periods. R i

funding across the financial sector. In addition, valuations in most asset markets are
broadly in line with historical norms, and an increase in term premiums in the past few
months has pushed yields on Treasury and investment-grade corporate securities closer to
average levels. The QS assessment reiterated the importance of certain structural
vulnerabilities in the financial system, including the complexity and interconnectedness
of large financial institutions, and noted potential concerns related to a growing appetite
for higher-yielding assets and associated pressures on underwriting standards, but it
suggested that current vulnerabilities are not unusually pronounced.
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. Longer-run inflation
expectations appear to have remained stable in recent years despite fluctuations in the
prices of crude oil, other commodities, and imports more generally, as well as persistently
wide margins of slack in labor and product markets. Furthermore, we still view the risks
to our inflation forecast as broadly balanced. On the downside, there is the possibility
that the soft readings on inflation seen this year could prove more persistent than we
expect, especially if low levels of resource utilization or subdued increases in unit labor
costs persist longer or have larger effects than we currently project. On the upside, an
increase in inflation expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current
stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a stronger-than-expected recovery
or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than is assumed in the
baseline.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first
scenario considers the possibility that in our baseline assessment, we have underestimated
the extent of labor market damage caused by the recession and its aftermath. In the
second scenario, restrained demand slows residential investment and causes house prices
y
to decelerate more than in the baseline. In the third, a stronger recovery is accompanied t
n
i
by an unsustainable buildup in financial risk-taking and leverage in corporate finance that a
t
r
e
ultimately leads to another recession. The fourth scenario considers the possibility that c

GDP will rise more strongly in the next couple of years than is projected in the baseline.
In the fifth scenario, the softness in consumer price inflation seen this year proves to be
more persistent than anticipated. The final two scenarios explore risks to the U.S.
economy from foreign economic developments—in the sixth scenario, financial stresses
experienced by EMEs escalate into a full-blown crisis, and in the seventh, easing of
geopolitical tensions leads to a gradual, but sizable, decline of oil prices.
We generate the first five scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. In the FRB/US simulations, as in the baseline
forecast, the federal funds rate follows an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
subject to the FOMC’s thresholds for the unemployment rate and projected inflation. For
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy rule, subject to the same
thresholds, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.2 In all cases, we
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.
Hysteresis
The prolonged period of slack demand in recent years appears to have had some
persistent adverse effects on the productive capacity of the economy. The staff’s baseline
analysis incorporates the negative effects of the weak economy on physical capital
accumulation, a modest rise in the natural unemployment rate, and some steepening of
the downtrend in labor force participation. That said, the baseline forecast assumes that
labor markets are in the process of healing. In this scenario, the damage to potential labor
supply is more extensive, reflecting a deeper manifestation of hysteresis than we have
assumed in the baseline.3 As a result, the natural rate of unemployment is ¾ percentage
point above the baseline and the trend labor force participation rate falls 1½ percentage
points below the baseline by 2013, leaving the current output gap 2½ percentage points
narrower. Potential labor input is eroded in future years because of hysteresis, but with
the labor market improving, the effects going forward are smaller than in the past,
although potential output is still 1½ percentage points below the baseline by the end of
2018. In this scenario, the annual rate of real GDP growth is about ½ percentage point
less than in the baseline, on average, through 2016, and it returns to its baseline pace by

2018. Resource slack decreases more rapidly in coming years, and the unemployment
rate therefore initially falls faster than in the baseline. Eventually, however, the higher
natural rate manifests itself, and unemployment is higher by 2017. Even with a narrower
margin of resource slack, inflation is only slightly higher than in the baseline because the
model’s Phillips curve is very flat. The federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective
lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Weak Housing Market
The most recent indicators of housing demand and residential investment have
been weaker than we expected, plausibly reflecting a greater restraint from the increase in
mortgage rates this year. This scenario considers the possibility that this restraint is
greater and persists longer than we have allowed for in the baseline. In particular,
residential construction is assumed here to edge up only slightly over the next two years.
These weaker demand conditions cause house price gains to average 2 percent per year
less than in the baseline. These developments shave about 1 percent off the level of real
GDP by the end of 2015, and the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent until the
second half of 2015. The weaker pace of economic growth and lower inflation relative to
the baseline cause the first increase in the federal funds rate to be delayed until the fourth
quarter of 2015.
Corporate Credit Boom and Bust
As noted in the recent QS Assessment of Financial Stability, the provision of
financing to speculative-grade corporate borrowers through high-yield bonds and
syndicated leveraged loans has remained robust this year, raising the possibility of large
future losses for investors. This scenario initially features a more aggressive easing in
lending standards, greater use of leverage, a larger reduction in risk spreads, and rapid
increases in equity prices. In response, business capital investment and consumer outlays
for durables and housing move strongly above the baseline, and the unemployment rate
drops below 5 percent in 2015. However, the financial froth proves unsustainable, and
about two years from now the leverage cycle reverses abruptly, leading to a sharp
curtailment of credit. The resulting plunge in business and household spending is severe y
t
n
enough to cause the economy to fall into recession, with the unemployment rate reaching i
a
t
r
almost 7½ percent by late 2017. Monetary policy responds to the credit boom by e

federal funds rate, the policy easing is sufficient to enable an economic recovery to take
hold. Inflation is little changed over the simulation horizon.
Faster Recovery
As currently measured, real GDP has risen only modestly over the past few years,
but the unemployment rate has declined substantially. In the staff baseline projection, we
have interpreted the weaker readings on GDP growth as resulting from factors that
continue to restrain aggregate demand. An alternative possibility is that the recent gains
in real GDP have been understating the true strength of the economy, and other
indicators—such as GDI and labor market conditions—have been accurate in signaling a
more rapid economic recovery. In this scenario, the improvements in household wealth
and the labor market over the past year lead to a stronger pickup in spending than in the
baseline projection. Additionally, the equity premium is assumed to decline faster than in
the baseline. Real GDP rises at an average annual rate of about 4 percent in 2014 and
2015; the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent by mid-2014 and reaches its natural
rate of 5¼ percent by the end of 2015. With resource slack decreasing more rapidly,
wages and unit labor costs accelerate gradually relative to the baseline; however, with
long-term inflation expectations assumed to remain well anchored, consumer price
inflation rises to only 2 percent by 2018. The federal funds rate lifts off from its effective
lower bound by the third quarter of 2014, three quarters earlier than in the baseline.
Low Inflation
In the baseline projection, the downside surprise on core inflation this year is
assumed to be largely transitory, and over the next few years inflation gradually moves
up toward 2 percent as the recovery continues. This view is based on the staff’s
assumption of firmly anchored longer-run inflation expectations, a view shared by most
New Keynesian Phillips curves. In this scenario, we examine the possibility that inflation
is currently behaving according to an accelerationist Phillips curve, which in current
circumstances generates declining longer-run inflation expectations, thereby leading to a
mutually reinforcing downward dynamic. As a result, inflation falls below 1 percent next
y year and edges close to zero thereafter. While the unemployment rate falls below its
t
n
i 6½ percent threshold in the first quarter of 2015, the very low inflation that prevails in
a
t
r
e this scenario causes the policy rule to prescribe the first increase in the federal funds rate
c
n
U only in the fourth quarter of 2015. By then, the unemployment rate is 6 percent.

Financial Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies
We expect financial market stresses in the EMEs to remain generally manageable.
However, with investors focused on both EME vulnerabilities and the prospective effects
of policy normalization in advanced economies, the risk of a substantial ratcheting up in
financial stress in EMEs remains significant. In this scenario, we consider the effects of a
financial crisis that engulfs many EMEs. Sovereign and private borrowing costs in these
countries soar, and the confidence of their households and businesses weakens
significantly. These events cause EME currencies to depreciate roughly 7 percent, on
average, against the dollar relative to the baseline, even though EME central banks are
assumed to raise policy rates to attenuate capital outflows. These factors lead real GDP
in the EMEs to decline 4½ percent relative to the baseline by early 2015.4
The financial stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to
the rest of the world. In the United States, corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices
decline relative to the baseline, while flight-to-safety flows push down term premiums on
government bond yields. In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger
exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports. As a result, U.S. real GDP growth
is less than 2 percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate hovers around 7 percent
through most of 2014 before beginning to decline gradually. With substantially greater
resource slack and lower import prices, core U.S. PCE inflation dips to around 1 percent
in 2014. Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower
bound until early 2016.
Lower Oil Prices
In our baseline forecast, global oil prices decline gradually over the next few
years. However, it is possible that various geopolitical tensions that have restrained
global oil supply, including the Iranian export embargo and civil unrest in Libya, will
diminish considerably more than is assumed, particularly if the recent agreement with
Iran over its nuclear program presages a quicker return by that country to full production.
In this scenario, we assume that oil prices fall $25 per barrel below the baseline by the
end of 2014.5 The decline in oil prices boosts U.S. domestic demand by raising real y

household income and increasing the return on investment.6 U.S. real GDP rises at an
annual rate of about 3½ percent, on average, in 2014 and 2015—¼ percentage point
above the baseline—and the unemployment rate is 5¾ percent at the end of 2015, about
¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline. Reflecting the decline in energy costs,
total PCE inflation drops to ½ percent in 2014, one percentage point below the baseline.
However, because longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored, core inflation
runs only about ¼ percentage point below the baseline over the next couple of years.
Given the largely offsetting implications for monetary policy of lower core inflation and
stronger real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound at
about the same time as in the baseline but rises a bit faster thereafter.

the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.
