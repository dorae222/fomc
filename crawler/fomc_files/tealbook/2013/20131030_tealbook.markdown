Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Based on the news we have received since the previous Tealbook—which is more D
n
limited than normal because of the data delays caused by the federal government o
c
E
shutdown—economic activity appears to have been increasing a little more slowly than
c
i
t
we had expected. Spending by consumers appears to have risen less than we had s
e
m
anticipated, and we think a portion of this weakness will persist through the end of the o
D
year. In addition, the direct and indirect effects of the government shutdown are expected
to temporarily reduce economic growth by an annual rate of about ½ percentage point in
the current quarter. We now project that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of just over
2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters, which, coupled with the downward
revisions to the second quarter, leave real GDP growth in 2013 at 2 percent, ¼ percentage
point less than the September forecast.
We have slightly revised up our forecast for real GDP growth over the medium
term, however, as recent financial market developments have led us to adjust our key
conditioning assumptions for the foreign exchange value of the dollar, interest rates, and
household wealth to be a bit more supportive of economic growth than in the September
Tealbook. Combining the weaker economic growth anticipated for this year and the
slightly stronger projected pace of economic expansion in the next two years, the level of
real GDP at the end of 2016 is expected to be just a little lower than in the September
Tealbook.
We read the employment report for September as a bit weaker, on balance, than
we expected, but it and the other labor market data remain broadly consistent with our
projection of continued gradual improvements in labor market conditions. As in our
September Tealbook forecast, the unemployment rate is projected to cross the
Committee’s 6½ percent threshold in the first quarter of 2015 and to end 2016 at just
under 5½ percent.
The limited data that we have received on consumer prices have been largely as
we had anticipated.1 With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, a

u t projected pickup in import prices over the medium term, and gradually diminishing
O
margins of slack in labor and product markets anticipated over the next few years, we
&
e l expect core PCE inflation to increase slowly from 1¼ percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in
v
e
D 2016; this forecast is the same as in the September Tealbook. We continue to expect
n
o energy prices to edge down over the forecast period, and thus headline inflation still is
c
E
projected to run a bit below core inflation over the medium term.
c
i
t
s

m
As always, numerous risks surround our outlook. We see several risks stemming
o
D
from federal fiscal policy, including the uncertain repercussions of the ongoing budget
consolidation and tax increases put in place at the beginning of this year, the potential for
greater fallout from the government shutdown, and the uncertain path for fiscal policy
going forward. Regarding private demand, consumer spending growth could remain
sluggish and not pick up as we anticipate, and the increase in mortgage rates since the
spring could weigh on residential construction by more than we currently expect. Also,
the pace of economic activity abroad continues to be a substantial risk, especially given
the vulnerabilities of many emerging market economies (EMEs). However, it is possible,
as suggested by the most recent four-quarter change in GDI, that economic activity has in
fact been rising more rapidly than indicated by the current GDP data. With regard to
inflation, the very low rates of core inflation seen earlier this year appear to have passed
as expected, but some risk remains that inflation could stay stubbornly low. That said,
there is also the risk that inflation could pick up by more than we expect, perhaps
stemming from an unanticipated and persistent firming in energy or other commodity
prices. Finally, with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, monetary policy
likely has less capacity to counteract the effects of downside developments with respect
to either real activity or inflation.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 With the unemployment rate still projected to fall below the Committee’s
6½ percent threshold in the first quarter of 2015, we continue to assume that
the federal funds rate will begin to rise from its effective lower bound in the
second quarter of 2015. The path of the federal funds rate after liftoff is also
about unchanged from the September Tealbook, averaging 2 percent in the
final quarter of 2016.

o
o
l
t
 Our assumption for asset purchases is also broadly unchanged from the u
O
September Tealbook, as we continue to assume that purchases of long-term &
l
securities under the current LSAP program will end by the middle of 2014. e
v
e
However, we nudged up the cumulative amount of purchases under this D
n
program by about $90 billion, to $1.3 trillion. o
c
E
c
i
Other Interest Rates s t
e
m
 The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen about 40 basis points since the o
D
September Tealbook. We attribute about half of that decline to a shift in
market expectations toward more accommodative paths for both Federal
Reserve asset purchases and the federal funds rate. Market participants appear
to expect somewhat more accommodative monetary policy than is consistent
with staff assumptions, and we anticipate that market expectations will move
into line with our forecast over time. The remainder of the decline in
Treasury yields since the September Tealbook reflects a reduction in the term
premium beyond what we think can be ascribed to a change in expectations
for asset purchases and has led us to revise down our projection for the
10-year Treasury yield over the next several quarters.
 Over the medium term, the forecast still calls for Treasury yields to rise
significantly, primarily to reflect the movement of the 10-year valuation
window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a
gradual waning of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds and rates on conventional
30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen roughly in line with yields on
comparable maturity Treasury securities. As a result, our forecasts for
corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium term have been
revised essentially in line with Treasury yields.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices have risen about 4 percent since the time of the September
Tealbook, about 3 percentage points more than we anticipated. We have
carried forward the higher stock prices over the next few quarters, but because
we think that the recent gains largely reflect a narrowing of the equity risk
premium that we anticipated to occur later in the projection, our forecast for

l
u t stock prices is essentially unrevised by the end of 2016. As in the September
O
Tealbook, we expect stock prices to move up at an average annual rate of
&
e l about 7½ percent over the next few years—a pace that, we think, will move
v
e
D the equity risk premium some way toward more typical levels.
n
o
c
E  House prices have risen by a bit more than we projected in the September
c
t i Tealbook, and we now expect them to rise at an annual rate of 9½ percent
s
e
m over the second half of this year. We continue to expect a slowing in house
o
D
price appreciation to an average rate of about 4 percent per year from 2014 to
2016.
Fiscal Policy
 The federal government was partially shut down from October 1 through
October 16 because of a temporary lapse in budget appropriations for the
current fiscal year. Beyond the near-term effects of the shutdown, the staff’s
assumptions for fiscal policy are little changed. (See the box “Fiscal Policy
Developments” for a discussion of the continuing budget resolution and the
extension of the federal debt limit that ended the shutdown, along with our
estimates of the effects of the shutdown on economic activity.)
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Our outlook for total foreign economic growth is little changed from the
September Tealbook. Real GDP growth in the foreign economies is estimated
to have moved up to an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the third quarter,
supported by a pickup in the EMEs. Looking ahead, foreign GDP is expected
to increase to 3¼ percent next year and 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016,
supported by waning fiscal drag and further improvement of financial
conditions in the euro area, the effect on EME exports of stronger economic
growth in the advanced economies, and a gradual abatement of financial
stresses in the most vulnerable EMEs.
 The broad nominal dollar index depreciated about 1¾ percent since the
previous Tealbook, having declined against the currencies of both the
advanced foreign economies and the EMEs. We project that the broad real
dollar will depreciate at an annual rate of about 2¼ percent over the medium
term, in part reflecting a further abatement of financial stress in the euro area.

Fiscal Policy Developments
&
l
e
v
Political wrangling over budget appropriations for fiscal year 2014 and the federal debt limit e
D
led to a partial shutdown of the federal government. The shutdown ended when a
n
temporary continuing resolution was passed to fund the government programs covered by o
c
discretionary appropriations through January 15. During the shutdown, about half of E
c
defense civilian workers were furloughed for one week and about 40 percent of nondefense i
t
s
civilian workers were furloughed for almost two and a half weeks. We estimate that the e
m
reduction in hours worked by these federal employees will reduce real government output, o
D
subtracting 0.3 percentage point from the annual rate of real GDP growth in the fourth
quarter of 2013 and boosting economic growth by the same amount in the first quarter of
2014 as government output returns to baseline.1 Because government employees will be
paid retroactively for the days they were furloughed, nominal compensation will be
unaffected by the shutdown and the GDP deflator will be increased by the same amount
that real GDP will be decreased. Government purchases for goods and services excluding
compensation were also reduced during the shutdown, but we assume that these purchases
will be made up before the end of the year. However, there is some risk that the disruptions
in federal purchases could last longer than we have assumed.
The temporary continuing resolution funds the government at levels consistent with
maintaining the full effects of the budget caps and sequestration. We assume that the
Congress will pass legislation to fund the government at levels consistent with the
sequestration through the rest of the fiscal year without further shutdowns.2 The Congress
also reached an agreement to raise the federal debt limit through February 7 (though this
limit will likely not be binding until the middle of 2014). We assume that the debt limit will
eventually be extended for a longer period before significant market disruptions occur.
Our assumptions for fiscal policy beyond the near term are similar to those in the September
Tealbook. Specifically, we continue to assume that the sequestration and spending caps
from the Budget Control Act will remain in effect and, together with further downward
pressure on defense expenditures from reduced overseas military operations, will restrain
discretionary federal spending over the medium term. Moreover, we continue to anticipate
some small degree of additional fiscal tightening from higher taxes and lower mandatory
spending as the bonus depreciation provisions for businesses and the Emergency
Unemployment Compensation program end at the beginning of next year. Our estimate of
total fiscal impetus, which excludes multiplier effects, indicates that changes in federal,
state, and local fiscal policies will subtract 1.1 percentage points from real GDP growth in
2013, 0.6 percentage point in 2014, 0.3 percentage point in 2015, and will be roughly neutral
for economic growth in 2016; these assumptions are little changed from the September
Tealbook forecast.
1
These direct effects plus the spillover effects of the shutdown into private‐sector spending are
expected, in total, to reduce real GDP growth by about ½ percentage point in the fourth quarter and then to
add ½ percentage point to GDP growth in the first quarter of next year.
2
Starting January 15, the level of funding consistent with the sequestration will be about $20 billion
lower than in 2013.

n Oil and Other Commodity Prices
o
c
E
 The spot price for Brent crude oil has declined slightly since the time of the
c
i
t
s September Tealbook, likely reflecting an easing of geopolitical tensions in the
e
m
Middle East, although futures prices for oil at longer-dated maturities are a
o
D
little higher. Consistent with these market developments, the price of
imported oil is projected to fall from about $105 per barrel this quarter to
$93 per barrel by the end of 2016, a flatter trajectory than in the September
Tealbook.
 A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices has declined about 3 percent since
the September Tealbook. From this lower level, we expect prices to move up
modestly over the projection period.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
As a result of the federal government shutdown, we have received fewer
economic data releases than usual since the September Tealbook. (See the box “Effects
of the Government Shutdown on Economic Data” for more details.) The information we
did receive, particularly for consumer spending, in conjunction with our estimates of the
direct and spillover effects on economic activity of the government shutdown, led us to
reduce our forecast for real GDP growth in the second half of the year by ¼ percentage
point to an annual rate of just over 2 percent.2
 With incoming data weaker than expected, we now estimate real PCE growth
to have slowed in the third quarter to an annual rate of just 1½ percent.3 We
continue to anticipate that the increases in net wealth and personal income,
along with the waning effects of the tax increases put in place at the beginning
of the year, will contribute to a pickup in spending growth in the fourth
quarter. However, the recent data on consumer outlays suggest a shallower
2 In addition, real GDP growth in the second quarter was revised down about ½ percentage point
to an annual rate of 2½ percent.
3 The retail sales report for September is now scheduled to be published on October 29, the first
day of the FOMC meeting.

trajectory moving into the quarter. Also weighing on our projection for u t
O
spending this quarter are a sizable drop in September vehicle sales that
&
l
appears likely to be only slightly reversed this month, the decline in consumer e
v
e
sentiment in September and early October, and a small reduction in outlays D
n
related to the government shutdown. In response, we have trimmed the o
c
E
forecast for real PCE growth in the current quarter by ½ percentage point, to
c
i
t
2½ percent. s
e
m
o
D
 The rise in mortgage rates since the spring appears to be damping housing
activity, but not by more than we had anticipated. New home sales and
applications for home purchase mortgages decreased modestly, on net, from
June to August. In addition, existing home sales edged down in September,
though the level remained higher than in the spring. In all, we expect real
residential investment to rise at an annual rate of 9½ percent in the second half
of this year, somewhat less than the pace seen in the first half of the year.
o We anticipate that the decline in mortgage rates since the September
Tealbook will, in coming months, reverse part of the recent drag on
single-family home sales and construction.
o Activity in the multifamily sector appears to have softened somewhat,
and we have lowered our near-term forecast for construction of these
units.
 With the latest available readings on orders and shipments somewhat weaker
than we had expected, we revised down our estimate of the growth in business
spending on equipment and intangibles in the third quarter to an annual rate of
2½ percent, 1 percentage point below our projection in the September
Tealbook. Given the generally positive tone of survey measures of business
conditions, we still expect the growth of equipment outlays to pick up in the
fourth quarter, but at a slower pace than in our previous projection.
 We reduced our estimate of net exports in the third quarter based on available
data showing a larger-than-expected rise in imports, but we anticipate that
surprise to be reversed this quarter, leaving the second-half contribution of net
exports to real GDP growth at an annual rate of about ¼ percentage point,
little revised on net.

O Effects of the Government Shutdown on Economic Data
&
l
e
v The federal government shutdown has affected the collection, processing, and publication of
e
D key economic data. Here we describe the effects of the shutdown on selected data releases
n from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Census Bureau—specifically, the Employment
o
c Situation, the Consumer Price Index, Retail Sales, and reports on orders and shipments of
E
capital goods—as well as the implications of delays in data releases for derived data products,
c
i
t such as industrial production and real GDP.
s
e
m
o The table on the next page lists a broader array of data releases affected by the shutdown and
D
shows their previously scheduled release dates, along with an updated release calendar.
The Employment Situation. The September employment report, which comprises the payroll
survey (Current Employment Statistics, or CES) and the household survey (Current Population
Survey, or CPS), was due to be released on October 4. The September data were collected and
mostly processed prior to the shutdown. As a result, the employment report for September
was released on October 22, fairly soon after the federal government reopened.
The report containing the October data has been postponed by a week to November 8. The
quality of the employment and related data in the CES should not be substantially affected, as
they are based on employer payroll records.1 However, the CPS for October—including the
unemployment rate and participation rate—may be less reliable than usual. Data collection for
the October CPS was scheduled to begin on October 13 but was delayed a week. While the
reference week for the survey was not changed, the delay in collecting the data could affect the
results, for example, because of recall bias.
Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI data for September were scheduled to be released on
October 16 and will instead be released on October 30. However, the collection of the
underlying price data was unaffected by the shutdown, so there should be no adverse effects
on the quality of the published CPI for September.
Data collection for the CPI data occurs throughout the month and concludes on the last
business day. Consequently, the government shutdown will affect the timing and number of
price quotes included in the sample, and, thus, the October CPI release may not be as reliable as
usual.2
Retail Sales. Data on retail sales for September (and the revised data for July and August) were
scheduled to be released on October 11 by the Census Bureau. The retail sales data are based on
direct mail and Internet surveys of firms, with follow‐up interviews performed by the Census
Bureau. While the paper‐copy responses are currently available for tabulation by Census Bureau
employees, online responders were unable to submit the requisite information while the Census
website was inoperable. Nonetheless, the Census Bureau has indicated that the September
data will be released October 29.
1
The BLS Electronic Data Interchange Center did not allow the transmission of data files during the
shutdown, but it reopened on the morning of October 17. It is possible that some establishments will be less
likely to report because of the downtime.
2
Because some items in the CPI are priced only in alternate months, and rents are only priced every
6 months, some portion of any problems with the October CPI may carry through until April of next year.

Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders. The Census Bureau released the August
Advance Durables report at the end of September, just prior to the government shutdown. The
collection of survey responses for the Bureau’s full report for August—the Manufacturers’
Shipments, Inventories, and Orders Survey—was mostly completed before the shutdown.
Although the quality of the August data should be minimally affected, the report, which was
scheduled for October 3, will not be issued; instead, the August data for the full manufacturing
sector will only be released with the September report on November 4.
The September Advance Durables report was scheduled to be released on October 25 and will
be released on time. However, the Census Bureau was unable to collect online responses
because of server downtime during the shutdown; therefore, response rates and data quality
might be affected.
Derived data. In addition to the four primary data releases discussed above, several important
derived data releases have been delayed because of the government shutdown. The Federal
Reserve’s G.17 statistical release on Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization was not
published as scheduled on October 17; the production indexes incorporate a range of data from
other government agencies that were delayed (notably including manufacturing production
worker hours from the employment report). The G.17 release with data for September will be
issued on October 28.
Finally, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates of gross domestic product for the
third quarter of 2013 and personal income and spending for September also incorporate a range
of other data that have been delayed. These BEA releases were scheduled to be published on
October 30 and 31, respectively, but with the delays in the underlying source data and the
furloughs of BEA staff, these data releases have been postponed until November 7 and 8.

u t  The available data suggest that manufacturing IP rose at an annual rate of just

rise 3¼ percent this quarter. This increase is a bit less than the September

THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
Our forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term is just a little higher than
in the September Tealbook. We expect real GDP growth to step up to 3¼ percent in
2014 and 3½ percent in 2015, then to ease slightly to 3¼ percent in 2016.
 On the positive side, the lower trajectories for interest rates and the dollar,
together with the higher paths for house prices and the stock market, are
anticipated to provide a greater lift to real output growth than in the previous
projection. In addition, the reversal of the government shutdown effects will
boost GDP growth early next year.
 However, these positive forces were partly offset by our decision to trim the
acceleration in real PCE for next year. In particular, we now assume that
some of the factors that we believe have been holding down consumer outlays
in recent quarters, such as tight credit conditions and pessimism about future
income prospects, will weigh on spending over the coming quarters by more
than we had previously expected.
 Coupled with the downward revisions to 2013, these changes leave the level
of GDP a touch lower at the end of the medium-term projection.
 We have made no material changes to our supply-side assumptions this round.
Thus, the small revisions we made to the GDP forecast carry through to the
GDP gap, leaving the gap just a little wider at the end of the medium term
compared with the September projection.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET u t
O
&
The available readings on labor market indicators remain consistent with our
l
e
v
projection of a continued gradual improvement in the coming months. e
D
n
o
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 148,000 in September, in line with our c
E
expectations in the September Tealbook.4 However, we took more signal i c
t
s
e
from private payrolls, which rose only 125,000 last month, somewhat lower m
o
than expected in the September projection. In response, we marked down our D
projection for private payroll gains in the fourth quarter to 160,000 per month,
15,000 less than in the September Tealbook.5
 The unemployment rate edged down in September to 7.2 percent. We
anticipate that the furlough of government employees will temporarily push
up the unemployment rate to 7.5 percent in October, but we expect the jobless
rate to return to 7.2 percent in November and December.
 Other labor market indicators that we have received also appear consistent
with a gradual ongoing labor market recovery. The staff’s labor market
conditions index, which summarizes the movements in 19 labor market
indicators, edged up further in September.
As in our previous projection, the labor market is anticipated to gradually improve
over the medium term in line with the overall pace of economic activity.
 The path of the unemployment rate is slightly higher than in the previous
projection and ends 2016 at just under 5½ percent, a little above the staff’s
estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.
 Our forecast for payroll employment is close to the September Tealbook
projection. We expect total payroll gains to step up to a pace of 200,000 per
4 In late September, the BLS released the preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision to the
level of payroll employment in March 2013. Abstracting from a change in the scope of the payroll survey,
which boosted the level of employment by around 475,000 workers, total nonfarm payroll employment is
expected to be revised down by 124,000, or 0.1 percent, a relatively small revision.
5 We anticipate that the government shutdown will reduce private employment gains in October by
25,000 and will provide an offsetting boost in November, leaving no imprint on the quarterly figures.
Because the government workers returned before the end of the relevant pay period, we do not expect that
government employment will be affected by the shutdown.

&
l
e
v
e  As shown in the “Labor Market Data and Projections” exhibit, compared with
D
n our projection in September 2012, when the Committee first tied its asset
o
c
E purchases to an improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the
c
t i current projection for the unemployment rate in mid-2014 is about
s
e
m 1 percentage point lower. By contrast, the monthly change in payrolls
o
D
currently projected for mid-2014 is little different from the September 2012
forecast. The level of total payroll employment, however, in mid-2014 in this
projection is nearly 1 million jobs (roughly ¾ percent) higher than in the
September 2012 Tealbook, partly due to faster-than-expected job growth
during the second half of last year and the first half of this year and partly
reflecting last year’s benchmark revision.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Our forecast for inflation is little changed from the September Tealbook.
 After having been held down in the first half of the year by declines in energy
prices and by unusually low core inflation, total PCE price inflation is
projected to pick up to an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter before
slowing to 1 percent in the fourth.
 The available data appear consistent with our view that the low readings on
core PCE inflation earlier this year were transitory. We continue to expect
core PCE prices to rise 1½ percent in the second half of this year, up from the
1 percent pace registered in the first half of the year.
 We project consumer energy prices to rise at an annual rate of 3¼ percent
over the second half of this year, down 2¾ percentage points from the
September Tealbook as a result of the recent decline in oil prices. Given the
downward tilt to our projected path for oil prices, we continue to expect that
consumer energy prices will move lower over the medium term.
 Core PCE inflation is anticipated to edge up gradually over the medium term,
from 1¼ percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 2016. Reflecting the projected

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK e
D
n
o
 In the long-term outlook, the federal funds rate continues to be set according c
E
to the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. As a c
i
t
s
result, the federal funds rate gradually rises from 2 percent at the end of 2016 e
m
o
to 4 percent by 2020. The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to D
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, and the process of
returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by
2021.
 Increasing household and business confidence, diminishing uncertainty,
further improvements in credit availability, and a declining equity premium
support real GDP growth of 2¾ percent in 2017, when the unemployment rate
reaches its natural rate of 5.2 percent. Thereafter, the pace of gains in real
GDP gradually moves down toward the longer-run growth rate of potential
output of 2¼ percent. Despite the low level of the federal funds rate in 2016
and the gradual increase thereafter, the unemployment rate does not fall
notably below the natural rate. (See the box “Headwinds and the Federal
Funds Rate in 2016” for further discussion.)
 With long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain well anchored and
essentially no margins of slack in labor and product markets, consumer price
inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019.

Headwinds and the Federal Funds Rate in 2016
&
l
e
v
e In the staff’s baseline forecast, the federal funds rate stays at its effective lower
D
bound until the second quarter of 2015, one quarter after the unemployment rate
n
o moves below the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold; thereafter, it is set according to
c
E an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. As a result of this procedure, the federal
c funds rate in the baseline projection is 2 percent at the end of 2016, well below its
i
t
s assumed long‐run value of 4 percent. This outcome may at first seem surprising
e
m because, at the end of 2016, the output gap is nearly closed, the unemployment rate is
o
D close to its assumed natural rate, and core inflation is only about ¼ percentage point
below its long‐run target. However, in our analysis, important headwinds continue to
weigh on economic activity even in 2016, and a continued accommodative stance of
monetary policy is required to achieve the economic outcomes we project.
Moreover, while the federal funds rate is lower than its assumed long‐run value in
2016, in the staff projection, the unemployment rate falls only slightly below the
natural rate and inflation rises gradually to its target level over the 2016–20 period.
The lack of any significant undershooting of the unemployment rate or overshooting
of inflation suggests that the monetary accommodation in the staff projection is just
sufficient to return the economy close to full employment and 2 percent inflation in
2018 and to keep it there going forward. In other words, the projected level of the
federal funds rate during those years is running close to a notion of an equilibrium, or
neutral, funds rate.1
In the staff’s view, the economy continues to be faced with substantial headwinds
that lift only gradually through 2016. Thus, such factors as household and business
confidence, perceptions of uncertainty, and credit availability still have some room for
improvement, even at the end of 2016. Similarly, although the equity premium is
forecast to narrow over the next three years, it is still above our estimate of its longer‐
run value in 2016. Stimulative monetary policy can serve to offset the adverse effects
of these factors, and under the staff outlook, with the federal funds rate at only
2 percent in 2016, inflation and employment are closer to their objectives than would
be the case under a higher path for the federal funds rate.
Fiscal policy has been a factor supporting the level of economic activity since the
beginning of the recession, but it has become increasingly less accommodative in
recent years—thus restraining economic growth—as the earlier fiscal stimulus policies
wind down and policy changes have been implemented to bring the federal budget
deficit back toward a sustainable level. These forces are expected to continue over
the next several years. As a result, in the staff’s view, fiscal policy will be providing
only a small degree of support to the level of economic activity at the end of 2016.
After 2016, however, the staff expects pressures from the aging of the population and
rising health‐care costs to put the debt‐to‐GDP ratio on a rising trajectory and to put
upward pressure on the level of the federal funds rate needed to maintain full
employment and price stability.
1
It is worth noting that under a different set of economic conditions, the inertial Taylor (1999)
rule with thresholds could deliver an outcome involving substantial undershooting of the
unemployment rate or overshooting of inflation.

Note: In September 2012, judgmental projections were prepared through 2015 for the Summary of Economic Projections variables, including the
unemployment rate, while projections for other variables, including the labor force participation rate and payroll employment, were prepared only
through 2014. This exhibit therefore reports a 2015 projection from the September 2012 Tealbook only for the unemployment rate.

1. The figures for August 2012 refer to data as originally published in the September employment situation release along
with the staff’s real-time translation of those data into hours worked. These were the latest available data at the time of
the September FOMC meeting.
2. Calculated as the mean of the 2014:Q2 and 2014:Q3 projections.
3. Projections of payrolls and hours worked include the effects of the benchmark revision to the payroll survey.
4. Total hours worked are aggregate hours in the nonfarm business sector. Because that series is available only on a
quarterly basis, the August 2012 figures refer to the quarterly percent change and level in 2012:Q3. The percent changes
and levels in hours are at annual rates.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
We estimate that foreign real GDP growth increased to a near-trend pace of
2¾ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter from 2¼ percent in the second quarter,
largely reflecting an acceleration of activity in China, Mexico, and Canada. Growth
appears to have moderated in Europe and Japan, but we had expected this slowing in our
September Tealbook forecast. Overall, our third-quarter estimate for the foreign
economies is slightly higher than we wrote down in September, mainly reflecting China’s
unexpectedly strong performance.
k
o
o
l
t
We expect total foreign growth to rise further over the forecast period, to u
O
3¼ percent next year and 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016. In the advanced foreign &
l
economies (AFEs), several factors should support the increase in growth, including e
v
e
accommodative monetary policies, diminishing drag from fiscal consolidation, and D
n
further reduction of financial stresses in the euro area. The anticipated recovery in the o
c
E
advanced economies, including the United States, should support an acceleration of l
’
t
n
output in the emerging market economies (EMEs), as should a fading of the near-term I
drag from stressed financial conditions in the more vulnerable EMEs. Relative to the
previous Tealbook, our foreign growth outlook is up slightly in 2014 on account of
stronger activity in the United States, and little changed thereafter.
As always, the foreign outlook is subject to important risks. The euro area’s exit
from recession has been encouraging, but the recovery remains fragile and any number of
shocks could undermine it. In the EMEs, we have been heartened that the financial
stresses that emerged in May have eased somewhat in the past two months, but the risk of
a generalized emerging market crisis has not gone away. The forecast has some upside
risks as well. For example, the welcome rebound in both EME and AFE growth in the
past several quarters suggests that a positive, self-reinforcing dynamic could be
materializing, engendering a faster rebound in global consumer and investor sentiment,
and thus resulting in more vigorous global economic growth than assumed in our
baseline. These latter two risks—the upside risk and the risk of a possible crisis in the
EMEs—are explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
With economic resource slack persisting and commodity prices projected to
remain quiescent over the forecast period, we expect that foreign inflation will remain
Page 31 of 81

--- Page 35 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) October 23, 2013
subdued at an annual rate of roughly 2½ percent, little changed from our previous
forecast. In this low-inflation environment, monetary policy remains generally
accommodative. Recent policy guidance has led us to push back our anticipated first
policy rate hike for the ECB from mid-2015 to early 2016. In the EMEs, we now expect
the Bank of Mexico to cut its policy rate again soon, following last month’s rate cut, to
support growth. In contrast, the central banks of Brazil, India, and Indonesia—some of
the more vulnerable EMEs—raised policy rates, citing concerns about inflation, and we
expect them to raise rates again before the end of the year.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
k
o
o
t l • Euro area. Recent activity indicators support our estimate that GDP growth
u
O
stepped down in the third quarter to ½ percent after transitory factors boosted
&
l growth during the second quarter to 1 percent. Nevertheless, data on PMIs
e
v
e
D and confidence suggest that the underlying strength of the economy continued
n to improve. We expect GDP growth to pick up to 1¼ percent in 2014 and
o
c
E then rise to 2 percent in 2015 and 2016, supported by diminishing drag from
l
’
t
n fiscal consolidation and further reduction of financial stresses. Our near-term
I
projection is a touch higher than in the September Tealbook, reflecting
slightly better-than-expected economic data and financial conditions.
Recently, the ECB signaled more explicitly its willingness to keep interest
rates low for an extended period. Thus with inflation projected to remain
comfortably below 2 percent for the foreseeable future, we now expect the
ECB to wait until early 2016 (two quarters later than in the September
Tealbook) to begin raising its policy rate.
• United Kingdom. Third-quarter GDP growth is estimated to be about
2½ percent, down a little from the second-quarter pace, as August data
showed surprising pullbacks in industrial activity and construction. Still, PMI
readings point to continued strength, and we project that GDP growth will
remain around 2½ percent through the rest of the forecast period. Higher-
than-expected core consumer prices and announced increases in utility prices
led us to revise up our projection of inflation in the second half of the year to
3 percent, but we expect inflation to settle down at an average rate of
2 percent from 2014 onward, amid persistent economic slack. Although the
mapping of GDP growth into lower unemployment will depend on the
Page 32 of 81

--- Page 36 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) October 23, 2013
uncertain path of productivity growth, we continue to expect the
unemployment rate to fall to the Bank of England’s 7 percent threshold in
mid-2015 with the first rate hike following later that year.
,
• Japan. Following a strong performance in the first half of the year on the
back of Abenomics-related exchange rate depreciation and rising confidence,
we estimate that growth slowed to a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.
Private consumption growth was sluggish through August and merchandise
exports were down for the quarter as a whole. September data on consumer
confidence, car registrations, and corporate sentiment, suggest that growth
k
will pick up to 3½ percent in the current quarter. However, growth should o
o
l
decline markedly next year in response to April’s hike in the consumption tax, u t
O
which Prime Minister Abe recently confirmed will occur as scheduled.
&
Although Abe also announced a new fiscal stimulus package, we estimate that e l
v
e
it will boost 2014 GDP by less than ½ percentage point, offsetting only about D
n
one-fourth of the drag from the consumption tax hike and the expiration of o
c
E
previous fiscal stimulus measures. All told, we see growth averaging slightly
l
’
t
above 1 percent over the next three years. Although this is a paltry n
I
performance by the standards of most other economies, it is nearly double the
pace of Japan’s estimated potential growth, and thus helps narrow its output
gap. Accordingly, and assuming continued monetary policy stimulus in 2014
and 2015, we project that inflation will settle at 1½ percent in 2016, just
below the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent target.
• Canada. Data on monthly GDP and the manufacturing PMI suggest that
growth bounced back to about 2½ percent in the third quarter, as projected in
the September Tealbook, following flood-related weakness in the second
quarter. As the rebound dissipates, we see growth moderating to 2 percent in
the current quarter before rising to 2¾ percent by mid-2015, supported by
improvements in global economic conditions. Following a flat reading in the
second quarter due largely to falling food and energy prices, inflation
rebounded to 1½ percent in the third quarter, and we expect it to edge up to
2 percent in 2016.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. Third-quarter GDP data suggest that the Chinese economy grew at an
annual rate of 9½ percent, up from a 7 percent average pace over the first half
of the year and 1¾ percentage point higher than we expected at the time of the
September Tealbook. The surge from relatively weak to above-trend growth
reflected a strong acceleration in industrial production, as well as solid
investment and retail sales growth, which were supported by continued
accommodative policy. We expect growth to moderate to a more sustainable
8 percent pace in the current and next quarter. This projection is supported by
k
o a somewhat softer tone of the September data and also reflects our belief that
o
l
t
u authorities will again attempt to rein in the shadow banking sector, damping
O
& credit growth. We then see Chinese growth gradually edging down to
l
e 7½ percent in 2016 in line with our estimate of downward-trending potential
v
e
D growth. This projection is up a bit in the current quarter from the previous
n
o Tealbook and little changed thereafter. Inflation is projected to be around
c
E
3 percent throughout the forecast period.
l
’
t
n
I
• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that GDP in the rest of emerging Asia
expanded at a 3¾ percent pace in the third quarter, about the same rate as in
the previous quarter, and ½ percent faster than our previous Tealbook
projection. The region appears to have benefited from the strong growth in
China, which supported an increase in exports in the third quarter following a
second-quarter contraction. Industrial production and the PMIs also have
picked up in much of the region. However, in India and Indonesia—where
financial stress remained elevated—recent indicators, on balance, point to a
further slowing of growth after a weak second quarter. Despite subdued
growth, central banks in both countries raised policy rates, primarily to curb
inflationary pressures. Going forward, we see growth in the region rising to
about 4½ percent in 2015 and 2016, supported by a pickup in external demand
from the advanced economies.
• Latin America. After contracting in the second quarter, Mexico’s GDP likely
grew 2¼ percent in the third quarter. Our expectation of renewed growth is
supported by the upbeat tone of several recent Mexican indicators, including
the index of overall domestic economic activity, industrial production, and
exports. With economic slack still noticeable and inflation pressures
Page 34 of 81

--- Page 38 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) October 23, 2013
relatively subdued, the Bank of Mexico cut its policy rate early last month and
we expect another rate cut soon. Supported by the expansion of activity in the
United States, we see Mexican GDP accelerating to 3¾ percent next year, a
bit faster than projected in the September Tealbook, before settling at
3½ percent thereafter, broadly in line with the contour of U.S. manufacturing
output.
After Brazilian GDP growth surged to 6 percent in the second quarter, recent
indicators—including industrial production, PMIs, and exports—suggest that
GDP was flat in the third quarter, about as we had expected in September.
k
We expect GDP growth to rise to 1¾ percent in the current quarter and further o
o
l
to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, as the drag from financial stresses wanes and u t
O
global economic growth picks up. Despite the recent slowdown, the Brazilian
&
central bank raised its main policy rate earlier this month by 50 basis points to e l
v
e
9.5 percent, a cumulative increase of 225 basis points since April, citing D
n
concerns about inflationary pressures, and we expect another rate hike before o
c
E
the end of the year. Although 12-month headline inflation moderated to
l
’
t
5.9 percent in September, it remains significantly above 4.5 percent—the n
I
midpoint of the inflation target range and the central bank’s ultimate goal.

Financial Developments
Largely in response to expectations for more-accommodative monetary policy,
conditions in domestic financial markets eased, on balance, over the intermeeting period,
with longer-term interest rates lower, stock prices higher, and the foreign exchange value
of the dollar down. That said, financial markets—particularly the Treasury bill and short-
term funding markets—were adversely affected for a time by investors’ concerns about
the outcome of the fiscal standoff and uncertainty about its effects on the economy;
however, strains eased quickly after a deal was reached in the Congress on October 16.
(See the box “Financial Market Effects of the U.S. Fiscal Standoff.”)
• Investors pushed out their anticipated timing of a change in monetary
policy—both the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases and the first
hike in the target federal funds rate—in response to three factors: Federal
Reserve communications at the time of the September FOMC meeting, which
were seen as more accommodative than expected; uncertainty about the
economic outlook and the fiscal situation in coming months; and somewhat
weaker-than-expected economic data releases.
• Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses slowed somewhat during the fiscal
s
t
standoff amid increased market volatility; however, access to credit remained n
e
m
ample for large firms, and equity prices rose, on net, over the intermeeting p
o
l
period. e
v
e
D
• Household financial flows appeared little affected by the fiscal standoff. a l
i
c
House prices showed further improvement in August, while mortgage rates n
a
n
declined about 45 basis points over the intermeeting period. i
F
• Financial conditions also eased in the advanced foreign economies on balance:
Equity prices moved higher, sovereign bond yields fell, and expectations for
policy rates declined. In emerging market economies (EMEs), financial
conditions continued to improve.

Financial Market Effects of the U.S. Fiscal Standoff
Investors began to focus on the U.S. debt ceiling debate as the October 17 deadline announced by
the Treasury approached.1 Market participants reportedly anticipated that the Treasury would run
out of cash by the end of October if the debt ceiling was not raised. Reflecting these concerns,
yields on Treasury bills maturing between mid‐October and early November rose sharply (top‐left
figure on the following page), some Treasury bill auctions in early October saw reduced demand,
and liquidity in the T‐bill market deteriorated, especially for certain securities that were seen as “at
risk” of delayed payment. In addition, one‐ and five‐year U.S. sovereign credit default swap (CDS)
spreads rose notably, and the CDS curve inverted, as in 2011.2 In the weeks leading up to the
deadline, implied volatility in the equity market rose considerably, but the S&P 500 index declined
only marginally and for a brief period, a notable contrast with 2011, when debt ceiling concerns were
compounded in part by the escalating fiscal and financial crisis in Europe.
Conditions in secured dollar funding markets were particularly strained for a time. Overnight
general collateral (GC) repo rates on Treasury and agency MBS collateral rose markedly (top‐right
figure on the following page), reaching highs similar to those seen in 2011, and term repo rates also
moved higher. Rates implied by general collateral financing futures for October and November also
rose notably. Rates on unsecured commercial paper (CP) rose sharply as well, and financial CP
outstanding declined in the days immediately before the deadline. By contrast, federal funds and
Eurodollar markets showed little reaction to debt ceiling concerns.
Outflows from institutional taxable money market funds (MMFs) accelerated in the two weeks
leading up to the October 17 deadline, although the magnitude of these outflows, at roughly
s $70 billion in aggregate, was somewhat smaller than in 2011 (bottom figures on the following
t
e n page).3 Market participants noted that the sharp rise in short‐dated T‐bill yields likely was due in
m
part to MMFs offloading at‐risk securities, and the funds’ aggregate holdings of Treasury securities
p
o declined notably in the two weeks prior to the deadline.4 MMFs also pared back holdings of CP
l
e
v leading up to the deadline. Consistent with these flows, deposit balances appeared to rise sharply
e
D at custodian banks.5

F 1 The Treasury had been operating under a debt issuance suspension period and using extraordinary
measures to avoid breaching the debt limit since May 20, 2013. Treasury Secretary Lew stated in a letter to the
Congress on August 26, 2013, that the Treasury expected to exhaust extraordinary measures in the middle of
October and revised the estimated date to “no later than October 17” in a follow‐up letter on September 25,
2013.
2 U.S. CDS are not very liquid, as indicated by the infrequent quotes and wide average bid–asked spreads in
the market. Market participants note that U.S. CDS are often traded to hedge positions or to take macro views
rather than for hedging sovereign risk.
3 In the two weeks before the 2011 debt ceiling deadline, institutional U.S. government MMFs had net
outflows of $63 billion, while institutional prime funds had $67 billion in net outflows. Over a similar period prior
to the October 17, 2013, deadline, institutional government and prime funds had net outflows of $54 billion and
$19 billion, respectively.
4 As of September 30, 2013, MMFs’ holdings included $156 billion in securities maturing between October 17
and November 15 and another $125 billion in securities maturing later in 2013.

The debt ceiling impasse also raised some operational issues. There had been reports of market
participants considering amending legal documentation in repo contracts to exclude certain at‐risk
securities from eligibility as collateral. Some central clearing counterparties also apparently
considered whether to prohibit members from providing as collateral Treasury securities perceived
to be at risk of delayed payment. Three exchanges announced other margin and haircut changes.6
In addition, investors expressed some uncertainties about the eligibility of at‐risk securities at the
Federal Reserve’s discount window and in open market operations.
Shortly after the agreement to raise the debt ceiling was reached on October 16, strains in Treasury
bill and secured funding markets eased significantly and institutional MMF assets rebounded
smartly. U.S. sovereign CDS spreads also declined somewhat. Nonetheless, market participants
noted the potential for financial market strains to reemerge leading up to the next debt ceiling
deadline in 2014.7

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY AND AGENCY MBS YIELDS
Implied rates on money market futures contracts and Treasury yields declined
sharply on the September FOMC announcement, the release of results from the Summary
of Economic Projections, and the press conference, which market participants viewed as
more accommodative than expected. Investors had reportedly put fairly high odds on a
reduction in the pace of asset purchases at the September meeting and so were surprised
by the FOMC’s decision to “await more evidence that progress will be sustained before
adjusting the pace of its purchases.” Implied volatility on interest rate options that expire
within three to six months moved markedly lower, while implied volatility on interest
rate options that expire at longer horizons declined by less.
Intermediate- and longer-term interest rates subsequently fluctuated within narrow
ranges amid limited and mixed domestic data releases, as investors increasingly focused
on the fiscal standoff and its implications for monetary policy. Toward the end of the
period, interest rates declined in response to the delayed and somewhat weaker-than-
expected September employment report. Other FOMC communications during the
intermeeting period, including the September FOMC minutes, were reportedly viewed as
largely in line with expectations and elicited limited reactions in financial markets. Over
the period as a whole, the federal funds rate path implied by overnight index swap (OIS)
quotes shifted down and flattened, with the rate at the end of 2015 falling about

40 basis points.1 This decline likely reflected, in part, lower term premiums associated e

for the subsequent two years.
Consistent with the market-based quotes, median responses to the Open Market
Desk’s October Survey of Primary Dealers, which was closed after the release of the
September employment report, indicated that dealers pushed out their projected liftoff

relative to the September survey. The fraction of dealers expecting a liftoff in the first

half of 2015 declined notably, while the fraction expecting a liftoff in the fourth quarter
of that year rose significantly. In addition, survey respondents pushed out the timing of
the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases into 2014, consistent with results from
recent surveys conducted by private-sector institutions. While dealers placed only a
10 percent probability on a reduction in the purchase pace later this year and an
additional 20 percent on a reduction at the January meeting, they assigned about a
35 percent chance on the March 2014 meeting and another 30 percent chance on the
meetings later next year. The total amounts of Treasury and MBS purchases during 2013
and 2014 were projected to be around $840 billion and $760 billion, respectively,
$200 billion and $175 billion higher than at the time of the September survey and
$125 billion and $80 billion higher than at the time of the “flash” survey conducted
immediately following the September meeting.
Five-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury yields dropped about 30, 30, and 20 basis points,
respectively, on net, over the intermeeting period. Decreases in forward rates were
particularly pronounced at three- to five-year horizons, suggesting the largest change in
expectations about the federal funds rate in that time frame.
The reduction in longer-term Treasury yields since the September FOMC meeting
was reflected in other longer-term rates. Agency MBS yields declined somewhat more
than the 10-year Treasury yield, while the option-adjusted spread for production-coupon s

MBS tightened noticeably. On net, 30-year conforming mortgage rates ended the period e

Notwithstanding the strains in the Treasury bill market during the fiscal standoff,
liquidity conditions in the Treasury coupon security market remained within historical
ranges over the intermeeting period. In particular, the Desk saw no evidence of a
material increase in securities considered at risk of delayed payment being offered into its
securities lending or purchase operations during the fiscal standoff. Liquidity conditions
in the agency MBS market improved modestly further following the deteriorations seen
during the summer, although they remain below long-term averages. Dollar-roll-implied
financing rates for 30-year Fannie Mae 3.5 percent and 4 percent coupon securities
increased and stayed near their recent high levels, consistent with limited settlement
pressures.
EQUITY PRICES AND BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE
The S&P 500 index increased 2.9 percent over the period despite elevated
volatility during the fiscal standoff. Share prices for nonfinancial firms have slightly
outperformed the broader market, increasing 3.0 percent over the same period. Third-
quarter earnings reports for nonfinancial firms have been coming in, on balance, about as
expected and suggest only modest growth on a seasonally adjusted basis relative to the
second quarter.
Despite a temporary slowing of business borrowing during the fiscal standoff,
s
t
financial markets generally remained accommodative. Issuance of nonfinancial corporate n
e
m
bonds and commercial paper, which had been particularly strong in September, weakened p
o
temporarily in October amid the elevated financial market volatility. Nevertheless, e l
v
e
financing conditions for larger firms eased somewhat over the intermeeting period, as D
l
corporate bond yields declined a little more than longer-term Treasury yields, leaving a
i
c
n
both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads moderately narrower over a
n
i
the period. F
Smoothing through the monthly moves, our most recent data indicate that
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to advance, on balance, in the third
quarter at about the pace posted in the previous quarter. More recently, C&I loans
jumped temporarily in early October as some banks reported funding firms’
precautionary draws on credit lines. In response to the October Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), a modest net fraction of banks
indicated they had eased standards on C&I loans over the third quarter, and survey
respondents reportedly continued to ease many of the surveyed loan terms on net.

However, banks reported no significant change in demand for C&I loans. (See the memo
“The October 2013 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,”
which will be distributed to FOMC participants on October 24, 2013.) Leveraged loan
issuance continued to be robust in September, boosted by a number of M&A and LBO
transactions. In the first three quarters of the year, issuance of collateralized loan
obligations reached $80 billion at an annual rate, similar to the pace seen prior to the
financial crisis.
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets continued to
improve slowly. CRE loans at banks rose moderately in September and early October,
and banks again indicated in the SLOOS that they had eased standards on CRE loans
over the past three months. CMBS issuance remained strong, as fundamentals in the
CRE market continued to improve gradually.
Funding conditions in the municipal bond market improved on balance. Outflows
from tax-exempt bond funds slowed. Issuance for new capital projects remained solid,
while refunding issuance declined amid elevated financial market volatility related to the
fiscal standoff. Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds decreased largely
in line with long-term Treasury yields, leaving the ratio between the yields of municipal
bonds and Treasury securities of comparable maturities little changed on net. In contrast,
the yield on general obligation bonds issued by Puerto Rico rose to a new high over the s
t

intermeeting period as investors continued to avoid those securities amid increasing e

concern over the territory’s fiscal situation. Tax-exempt bond mutual funds are important o

mortgages stayed near historical lows, owing in part to the tight underwriting standards
for new mortgages that have prevailed over the past several years. Mortgage rates
declined about 45 basis points over the intermeeting period but are still about
70 basis points above their early-May lows, and the higher rates continued to weigh on
mortgage refinancing applications. Purchase applications moved a bit lower, although,
on a seasonally adjusted basis, they remained only about 6 percent below their levels
prior to the rise in mortgage rates last spring and summer. Respondents to the SLOOS
also indicated that they had experienced a much smaller decline in purchase applications
than refinancing applications since the spring. Moreover, a large fraction of banks
reported having eased standards on home-purchase loans to prime borrowers, on net,
though comments from some banks suggest that the easing was narrowly concentrated in
specific sectors.
Nonmortgage credit flows were little changed in August relative to earlier in the
summer. Auto loans and student loans continued to expand at a robust pace, while credit
card debt stayed about flat—a pattern consistent with changes in bank credit through
early October. In the October SLOOS, a moderate fraction of banks reported having
eased standards on, and experienced stronger demand for, credit card and auto loans on
balance. More generally, auto credit remained widely available, even for subprime loans.
Credit card solicitation mail volume moved sideways at moderate levels through August,
s
but underwriting standards for such loans reportedly remained tight compared with t
n
e
longer-term norms. Consumer ABS issuance stayed robust during the third quarter but m

Bank credit declined slightly during the third quarter. Growth of core loans F
slowed, primarily because of a sizable decline in outstanding balances of closed-end
residential mortgages on banks’ books. The reduction in mortgage refinancing activity
likely reduced the stock of loans held by banks prior to securitization. Banks’ securities
holdings declined sharply, likely reflecting in part sales in response to the rise in longer-
term interest rates in the third quarter. Consistent with the reduction in longer-term
interest rates since the September FOMC meeting, unrealized losses on securities held in
banks’ available-for-sale portfolios declined.

Third-quarter earnings reports for large banks generally met or exceeded analysts’
modest expectations. Earnings were reduced by elevated litigation expenses and weak
trading income. Banks also reported flat or lower net interest margins and substantially
lower revenue in mortgage banking due to lower refinancing volumes, with several
announcing sizable reductions in mortgage staff. However, the release of loan loss
reserves due to substantial improvements in credit quality, especially for residential
mortgages, continued to support bank profitability.
Preliminary data indicate that M2 growth picked up temporarily in the days
leading up to the debt ceiling deadline, after growing moderately in September. Deposits
appeared to increase sharply at major custodian banks as institutional investors shifted
from money fund shares to bank deposits, and as money funds liquidated short-dated
Treasury securities and increased their bank deposits in anticipation of possible
redemptions.4 These inflows to M2 are estimated to have quickly reversed following the
October 16 settlement.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
The immediate reaction in foreign financial markets to the September FOMC
announcement was substantial, with foreign stock prices rising, yields and spreads
declining, and the dollar depreciating against most currencies. Although the partial
s
t
shutdown of the U.S. government and heightened concerns over the debt ceiling n
e

temporarily reversed these moves, foreign markets reacted positively to the resolution of p
o
the crisis on October 16. e l

n
Implied future short-term interest rates one to two years ahead also declined for those i

countries, suggesting that market participants scaled back somewhat their expectations
for future monetary policy tightening.
Equity market indexes in the advanced foreign economies ended the period
higher. Euro-area stock prices outperformed, with bank stock prices rising 10 percent,
4 Reserve balances at major custodian banks rose sharply, which is estimated to have been the
result of large deposit inflows, for which data lag. Complete data for the 2011 debt ceiling episode show
that increases in deposit and reserve balances at these institutions were synchronous.

led by those in Spain and Italy. In emerging market economies, stock prices have
recovered from the financial turmoil of early May and June. Mutual fund flows to
emerging markets have stabilized, following large outflows earlier this year.
The dollar depreciated about 1 percent over the period, with declines against both
advanced economy and emerging market currencies, as market participants pushed out
their expectations for the timing of the next change in U.S. monetary policy. In addition,
several EMEs continued to intervene to support their currencies, and the central banks of
Brazil and India increased their benchmark policy rates.
Although demand by some EMEs for U.S. Treasury securities has been weak,
particularly in those economies that have been facing depreciation pressures, recent data
on custody holdings at the FRBNY suggest that foreign official investors continued to
purchase Treasury securities in September and October, notwithstanding concerns about
the debt ceiling.

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first
scenario considers the possibility that the substantial decline in the unemployment rate
seen over the past year is a more accurate signal of the pace of the recovery than the
modest gains in real GDP, and that, going forward, GDP rises more strongly than in the
baseline. In the second scenario, by contrast, the combination of steady declines in the
unemployment rate and tepid GDP growth in recent years reflects greater damage to the
supply side than assumed in the baseline. The third scenario articulates why several of
the factors we believe have held down consumer spending growth in the past could be
more persistent than we anticipate, preventing the projected acceleration in the baseline
from materializing. The fourth scenario considers the risk that the softness in consumer
price inflation seen earlier this year reemerges and proves to be more persistent than
anticipated. The final two scenarios consider downside and upside risks to the U.S.
economy from foreign economic developments—first, that financial stresses experienced
by EMEs escalate substantially, and, second, that the pace of economic growth abroad
could increase more rapidly than assumed in the baseline.
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. In the FRB/US simulations, as in the baseline
forecast, the federal funds rate follows an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
subject to the FOMC’s thresholds for the unemployment rate and projected inflation. For
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy rule, subject to the same
thresholds, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.1 In all cases, we
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.

be understating the true strength of the economy, and other indicators—such as GDI and
labor market conditions—may be sending a more accurate signal. This scenario adopts a
more optimistic view of aggregate demand conditions. With headwinds assumed to be
easing more rapidly than in the baseline, a faster, broad-based recovery is able to gain
momentum, as improvements in household wealth and consumer and business sentiment
boost spending, and the increase in spending, in turn, leads to increased employment,
higher incomes, and further spending gains. All told, real GDP rises at an annual pace of
4 percent in 2014 and 2015. The unemployment rate falls below the 6½ percent
threshold by the fourth quarter of 2014, prompting liftoff in the federal funds rate
one quarter ahead of baseline. Despite tight labor markets, inflation rises only marginally
above the baseline, reaching 2 percent in 2018.
Supply-Side Damage
In this scenario, the observations of sluggish real GDP growth and a falling
unemployment rate in recent years indicate not that the estimates of GDP understate the
strength of the economy, as in the previous scenario, but rather that the damage to
aggregate supply during the past several years is greater than is estimated in the baseline.
Accordingly, we assume a slower growth of structural productivity such that potential
output has expanded at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent since 2011, ½ percentage point
lower than in the baseline, and continues to rise more slowly than in the baseline through
2018. As a result, the current output gap is 1½ percentage points narrower than in the
baseline. Real GDP rises at a rate of 2¾ percent per year, on average, through 2015, but
the unemployment rate nonetheless continues to decline at roughly the same pace as it
has since late 2010—and thus more steeply than in the baseline—and it falls below
6½ percent by the third quarter of 2014.2 With resource slack substantially narrower and
productivity gains smaller than in the baseline, inflation rises to 2 percent in 2016, and
the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of
2014, two quarters earlier than in the baseline.

be smaller and may not materialize at all. For example, the unexpectedly sluggish
recovery to date may indicate that households have become more pessimistic in forming
expectations of their permanent income, or less willing to spend out of increases in
wealth. In addition, increased financial regulation and the disappearance of certain credit
products may permanently reduce credit availability. In this scenario, consumer spending
continues to increase at a 2 percent annual pace over the coming years, similar to the pace
over the past two years. As a consequence, GDP growth remains subdued relative to the
baseline, and the rate of labor market improvement slows significantly. With the
unemployment rate lingering above the 6½ percent threshold until 2017, the federal funds
rate remains at the effective lower bound for an additional two and a half years. The
inflation rate remains almost ½ percentage point below the Committee’s target at the end
of the forecast horizon.
Low Inflation
In the baseline forecast, the low readings on core inflation seen earlier this year
are assumed to have been largely transitory, and over the next few years as the recovery
continues, inflation gradually moves back toward 2 percent. In this scenario, the recent
performance of inflation proves to be a harbinger of a longer-lasting decline in actual
inflation, bringing down longer-run inflation expectations and thereby leading to a
mutually reinforcing downward dynamic. Inflation is below 1 percent next year and
edges down further thereafter, falling close to zero. In this environment, investors
become increasingly concerned that the economy is mired in a weak state with price
behavior verging on deflation and monetary policy remaining constrained by the effective
lower bound for the federal funds rate. As a result, risk premiums rise and put upward
pressure on real long-term interest rates, modestly restraining household and business
spending and boosting unemployment relative to the baseline over the next few years.
The unemployment rate falls below its 6½ percent threshold in the second quarter of
2015, but because inflation is so low, the policy rule does not prescribe the first increase
in the federal funds rate until mid-2016. While the unemployment rate is nearing its
natural rate by that time, the persistent downward shift in inflation expectations means
that inflation remains well below the FOMC’s long-run objective. As a consequence, the y

on both EME vulnerabilities and the prospective effects of policy normalization in
advanced economies, the risk of a substantial ratcheting up in financial stress in EMEs
remains significant. In this scenario, we consider the effects of a financial crisis in one or
more of the most vulnerable of these economies, which then spills over to the EMEs
more broadly. Sovereign and private borrowing costs in these countries soar, and the
confidence of their households and businesses weakens significantly. These events cause
EME currencies to depreciate almost 7 percent, on average, against the dollar relative to
the baseline, even though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates to
attenuate capital outflows. All told, real GDP in the EMEs declines 4½ percent relative
to the baseline by early 2015. The financial stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some
financial spillovers to the rest of the world, including the United States: Corporate bond
spreads rise and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight-to-safety flows
push down term premiums on government bond yields. In addition, weaker foreign
economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.
As a result, U.S. real GDP growth is only 2 percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate
stays above 7 percent until the end of 2014 before beginning to gradually decline. With
substantially greater resource slack and lower import prices, core U.S. PCE inflation dips
to around 1 percent in 2014. Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its
effective lower bound through the end of 2015.
Higher Global Growth
The headwinds facing many of our foreign trading partners—including financial
stresses in the EMEs and credit constraints in Europe—may ease more rapidly than
envisioned in our baseline, spurring a faster recovery abroad. In this scenario, foreign
output expands at an annual pace about 1 percentage point above the baseline through the
end of 2015 as improvements in financial conditions and sentiment lead to higher
business and household spending. Moreover, the broad real dollar depreciates about
5 percent relative to the baseline as confidence in foreign economies improves and
monetary policy abroad tightens. The stronger foreign activity and the weaker dollar
cause U.S. real net exports to rise relative to the baseline. As a result, U.S. real GDP
rises at a 3¾ percent annual rate in 2014 and 2015, and the unemployment rate falls y
t
n
below 6½ percent by the end of 2014. Higher import prices and stronger activity boost i
a
t
r
core PCE inflation to close to 2 percent in 2015. The federal funds rate lifts off from its e
c
n
effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2015, one quarter sooner than in the baseline, U
&
and rises more quickly thereafter.

Note: “Staff” represents Tealbook forecast errors applied to the Tealbook baseline; baselines for FRB/US, BVAR, EDO, and
the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.
