Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook

The economic data we have received since the January Tealbook have mostly met D
n
or exceeded our expectations. In the labor market, payroll employment gains in the past o
c
E
few months have been somewhat larger than we had anticipated, while the
c
i
t
unemployment rate edged down, on balance, much as we had projected. The incoming s
e
m
data on private spending have also been a little stronger, on net, than we expected. By o
D
contrast, the fact that the Congress has allowed the federal spending sequestration to go
into effect suggests that fiscal policy will weigh on near-term economic growth by more
than we had assumed in the January Tealbook. In all, real GDP is now projected to rise
at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the current quarter, the same as in the January
Tealbook, but then to step down to a 1¾ percent pace in the second quarter as cuts in
federal government purchases deepen.
Our medium-term projection for real activity is essentially unchanged from the
January Tealbook, with real GDP projected to rise 2½ percent this year, 3¼ percent in
2014, and 3½ percent in 2015. The additional drag from the greater degree of fiscal
consolidation and higher foreign exchange value of the dollar in the current forecast is
offset by higher projected equity and house prices, positive momentum from the recent
spending data, and a stronger outlook for domestic oil production. As in previous
projections, the mild acceleration in output that we project to occur over the medium term
reflects the anticipated waning of a number of headwinds that have been restraining
growth in the past few years, including the economic and fiscal situation in Europe and
restrictive fiscal policy here at home; at the same time, we continue to anticipate that
monetary policy will remain highly accommodative and that household and business
sentiment will improve.
In line with the gradual pickup in economic activity, we expect the
unemployment rate to decline from 7¾ percent in the first quarter of this year to about
6¼ percent at the end of 2015. Thus, at the end of 2015, the unemployment rate is still
projected to be ½ percentage point above its natural rate. In this respect as well, our
current forecast is very similar to the January Tealbook.
On net, readings on consumer prices have come in close to our expectations.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following the
December FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the staff economic
projection since the December Tealbook.
The staff projections for both real GDP growth and inflation through 2015 are essentially
unrevised since December and continue to show a gradual strengthening of economic
growth with inflation remaining below, but edging toward, the FOMC’s long-run objective of
2 percent. The projection for the unemployment rate is revised down throughout the
medium term, largely reflecting the downward surprise in the unemployment rate since the
December Tealbook, which we have allowed to persist. Nonetheless, significant slack
remains even at the end of 2015.
The staff projection for GDP growth over the longer run has been revised a little lower since
December to be better aligned with our long-run projections for growth of the population
and structural multifactor productivity. This lower expected rate of GDP growth over the
long run shows through, essentially one-for-one, to our estimate of the equilibrium federal
funds rate.
The baseline path for the federal funds rate in the current projection is set in a manner
consistent with the quantitative thresholds described in the Committee’s statement
following the December meeting; in the December forecast, the path of the federal funds
rate was tied to the date-based forward guidance then in force. Nevertheless, the federal
funds rate trajectory is essentially unrevised since December and continues to envision the
federal funds rate moving above its effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2015.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
Our monetary policy assumptions are unchanged in this Tealbook. Because our
medium-term projections for the unemployment rate and inflation are close to the ones
we presented in January, our implementation of the Committee’s threshold-based
guidance continues to result in the federal funds rate lifting off from its effective zero
lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2015. For now, we have also maintained our
January assumptions for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In particular, we continue
to assume the FOMC will cease its current LSAP program this June, bringing the
cumulative net purchases since December to $500 billion.2
Other Interest Rates
Since the January Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased about
20 basis points to just over 2 percent, a little more than we had anticipated. Nonetheless,
the projected path of the yield is little changed from the January Tealbook; we continue
to expect it to increase steadily to about 4 percent by the end of 2015. This projected
increase primarily reflects the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the
period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual waning of the effects of
the FOMC’s balance sheet policies. We also still allow for some upward pressure on the
10-year Treasury yield as investors move toward our assumption that the Federal Reserve
will purchase fewer securities than they currently anticipate.
1 The February reading on the consumer price index will be published at the end of this week.
2 For reference, had we assumed instead that the Federal Reserve would purchase another
$250 billion of longer-term securities over the second half of this year but keep the path of the federal funds
rate unchanged through 2017, we would have trimmed our projection for the level of the unemployment
rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 about 0.1 percentage point and marked up our forecast for consumer price
inflation in 2015 a few basis points.

Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have moved up about 25 basis points u t

since the January Tealbook, leaving their spreads to yields on comparable-maturity
&
Treasury securities a touch wider. We have carried the slightly higher bond spread e l

e
through the next several quarters, but we still expect the spread to narrow gradually over D

Conventional 30-year mortgage rates have increased about 25 basis points and are
c
i

expected to move up about in line with benchmark Treasury yields, which would take s

m
them from their current level of about 3½ percent to about 5½ percent by the end of 2015. o
D
Equity Prices and Home Prices
Broad indexes of U.S. stock prices have climbed about 4 percent since the
January Tealbook, a higher gain than we had anticipated. We continue to expect equity
prices to rise at an average annual rate of close to 9 percent through the end of 2015,
resulting in a higher projected path of stock prices this round.
Recent readings on home prices have once again been stronger than we had
expected, leading us to revise up our forecast for the level of house prices significantly
throughout the projection period. The recent large price increases appear to have been
related to tight supply conditions in many local markets. We expect these conditions to
persist this year and now forecast house prices to rise 8 percent in 2013, about the same
as the increase seen in 2012. In 2014 and 2015, we expect increases in house prices to
slow to an average pace of just under 4 percent as a step-up in construction adds to
supply and higher mortgage rates weigh on housing affordability. At the end of 2015, the
projected level of house prices is about 5 percent higher than in the January Tealbook.
Fiscal Policy
We have changed our assumptions regarding how the spending sequestration will
play out. In January, we assumed that the Congress and the Administration would forge
a compromise that would eliminate all of the effects of the sequestration in 2013 and
replace it with much more gradual deficit-reduction policies in later years. While the
ultimate disposition of the sequestration remains highly uncertain, it now appears likely
that there will be more fiscal restraint this year than we had previously thought. As a
result, we have incorporated a “modified sequester” into our forecast: We assume that
fiscal policymakers will reach a compromise that reduces spending in 2013 and 2014 by
half of the amount that would occur if the full sequestration is left in place. We continue
to assume additional tightening in 2015.

u t With these new assumptions, fiscal policy at all levels of government is projected
O
to restrain the rate of real GDP growth in 2013 by 1 percentage point (excluding
&
e l multiplier effects)—about ¼ percentage point more than in the January Tealbook.3 We
v
e
D continue to forecast that the fiscal restraint on growth of aggregate demand will decrease
n
o to ½ percentage point in 2014 and to ¼ percentage point in 2015. As a result of policy
c
E
actions to reduce the deficit and the improving economy, the federal budget deficit,
c
i
t
s which was 7 percent of GDP ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal year 2012, is projected to fall to
e
m
o 4¾ percent of GDP this fiscal year, and to 2¾ percent of GDP in fiscal 2015.
D
Foreign Activity and the Dollar
Foreign real GDP rose at an unexpectedly weak 2 percent pace in the fourth
quarter. Growth was disappointing in most advanced foreign economies, with output
contracting in Europe. By contrast, the expansion of output growth in emerging market
economies exceeded our expectations. Weak incoming data on the advanced economies
in the current quarter and some increased financial stresses in Europe following Italy’s
inconclusive parliamentary election have led us to mark down total foreign growth a little
over the forecast period. However, we anticipate that financial conditions in Europe will
resume their progress toward normalization—a development that, along with diminishing
fiscal drag and accommodative monetary policy, is projected to help end the euro area’s
recession and lift overall foreign growth to 3 percent this year, 3¼ percent in 2014, and
3½ percent in 2015.
Since the time of the January Tealbook, the nominal exchange value of the dollar
has appreciated almost 2 percent, with larger gains against advanced-economy currencies
than those in emerging markets. The Japanese yen depreciated about 8 percent against
the dollar, as the nomination of Haruhiko Kuroda to lead the Bank of Japan reinforced the
view that aggressive monetary policy action is forthcoming. In addition, both the euro
and the pound depreciated markedly as readings on activity came in weak, expectations
for further monetary accommodation increased, and financial stresses in Europe
intensified after the Italian election. We assume that the dollar will depreciate in real
terms at an annual rate of 2¾ percent through the end of 2015, reflecting the gradual
abatement of European financial stresses—which should relieve safe-haven pressure on
3 If a compromise is not reached and the full sequestration remains in place, we would expect an
additional drag on real GDP growth of ¼ percentage point and the unemployment rate to be 0.1 percentage
point higher in 2013.

Oil and Other Commodity Prices n
o
c
After rising through mid-February, crude oil prices fell back in recent weeks on E
c
i
growing concern over the strength of global demand. The spot price of Brent crude oil s t
e
m
closed at about $110 per barrel on March 12, down about $2 from the time of the January
o
D
Tealbook. The projected path for the price of imported oil is also down by about the
same amount on average. From this lower level, the price of imported oil is projected to
remain fairly steady for the remainder of this year and then to decrease slowly in the next
two years, consistent with futures prices. This downward trajectory is likely due, in part,
to expectations of increased crude production in the United States and Canada.
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices has moved down since the time of the
January Tealbook, partly as the global supply of agricultural products appears to have
been less restricted by last summer’s drought than market participants originally feared.
Metals prices also edged down, on net, largely reflecting concerns over the strength of
Chinese demand. We project that nonfuel commodity prices will remain relatively flat
through 2015, a path about in line with quotes from futures markets.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We currently expect real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the
current quarter—unrevised from the January Tealbook. This pace of growth is boosted
by the assumed recovery in agricultural production and a hurricane-related bounceback.
In the second quarter, growth slows to a 1¾ percent pace as these impulses fade and the
spending cuts associated with the modified sequestration kick in. The adjustment to
fiscal spending accounts for most of the ½ percentage point downward revision to our
second quarter forecast relative to the January Tealbook.
Household Spending
We project that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of 2 percent in the current
quarter, up about ¼ percentage point from the January Tealbook. Based on retail sales
and motor vehicle sales through February, PCE appears to be holding up reasonably well
in the face of January’s increase in payroll and income tax rates. We continue to expect
households’ gradual adjustment to the lower level of disposable income to weigh on

In the housing market, the incoming data on starts and sales continue to be n
o
c
consistent with a gradual recovery. At the same time, the number of homes for sale has E
c
i
fallen considerably, bringing inventories of both new and existing homes to very low t
s
e
m
levels by historical standards. The limited supply of homes for sale is likely due to
o
D
several factors, including underwater borrowers’ reluctance to sell, a slowing in the flow
of foreclosed properties coming to the market, and the still-low level of new construction.
All told, as in the January Tealbook, we project single-family starts to rise further in the
near term, in line with continued gradual increases in demand.
Tight mortgage credit and concerns about future labor market conditions appear
to have fueled demand for rental units, leading to falling vacancy rates and rising rents in
the multifamily sector. Multifamily starts and permits have nearly recovered to their pre-
crisis levels, and we expect to see further growth in this sector as the supportive
fundamentals persist.
Business Investment
Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft have
continued to recover from a weak patch in the summer of last year. New orders surged
almost 10 percent (not at an annual rate) over the three months ending in January and the
level of new orders is now above shipments, suggesting that shipments will remain on an
upward trajectory in coming months. Forward-looking indicators of business investment
are also consistent with a pickup in real investment in equipment and software (E&S) in
the first half of this year relative to the second half of last year. For example, the ISM
surveys have shown some improvement of late, and analysts’ earnings expectations for
capital goods producers have turned more positive since December. Overall, we forecast
real business spending on E&S to step up to a growth rate of 5¾ percent in the first half
of this year, somewhat faster than in the January Tealbook.
4 Our forecast for real disposable personal income jumps in the fourth quarter and falls back in the
first quarter, largely owing to the BEA’s estimate that some dividends and bonuses were paid early in
anticipation of tax increases beginning in 2013. We expect consumers to smooth through this income
volatility and do not expect it to have a large effect on consumption.

Our estimate of nonresidential investment in the fourth quarter was revised up u t
O
substantially, as new source data revealed a rush of construction outlays in anticipation of
&
the possible expiration of a tax credit for wind power structures.5 We have revised down e l
v
e
our forecast for the level of spending in the first quarter accordingly. Excluding the D
n
power sector, recent data suggest a modest improvement in nonresidential building o
c
E
investment in the first half of this year that is consistent with our January Tealbook
c
i
t
forecast. Nevertheless, high vacancy rates and low commercial real estate prices should s
e
m
continue to weigh on investment. Moreover, although financing conditions for existing o
D
commercial real estate have improved, they remain tight for new construction.
Inventories appear fairly well aligned with sales in most sectors, and our near-
term inventory forecast is largely unrevised on net. Estimates from the staff’s flow-of-
goods system and indicators of inventory sentiment from the ISM through February show
no evidence of sizable inventory imbalances. Consequently, real nonfarm inventory
investment is expected to be roughly neutral for real GDP growth in the first half of this
year. In the farm sector, real inventory investment is expected to boost real GDP growth
by ¾ percentage point in the first quarter, as farm output returns to normal after having
been held down by the drought in the second half of last year. We expect this impetus to
growth to disappear in the second quarter.
Government
Improvements in state and local government budgets are reducing the pressure on
these jurisdictions to cut their purchases. Overall, we expect their real purchases to
decrease only a little in the first half of 2013. Nevertheless, this projection is somewhat
softer than in the January Tealbook due to weaker-than-expected incoming data on state
and local construction spending and employment so far this quarter.
We now project total real federal purchases to contract at an annual rate of
2 percent in the current quarter, a decline that is a little smaller than in the January
Tealbook due to incoming data on defense spending. We do not expect real federal
purchases in the first quarter to be materially affected by the spending sequestration that
began on March 1 because most agencies have reportedly delayed furloughs and other
5 The tax credit was extended as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal. The new data on construction
outlays were released after the publication of the second estimate of the NIPA. We expect the revised data
to boost the published figure for fourth-quarter real GDP growth ¼ percentage point when they are
incorporated into the third estimate.

Real exports of goods and services are projected to rebound in the current quarter
o
D
after having fallen in the fourth quarter, supported by the continued robust expansion of
the emerging market economies. Our forecast for export growth of about 5 percent in the
first half of the year is little changed, on balance, from the January Tealbook, although
we shifted some exports from the first quarter to the second to account for delivery delays
at Boeing as the company works to correct problems with the 787 Dreamliner. Real
imports of goods and services are expected to grow at an average rate of 3¼ percent in
the first half of this year, consistent with the projected pace of expansion in U.S.
economic activity. This forecast is a little lower than the January Tealbook projection,
reflecting both the markdown to U.S. growth and a lower projection for oil imports.
Overall, we expect net exports to be a slight positive for growth in the first half of this
year.
The Industrial Sector
We project manufacturing output to rise at an annual rate of 7 percent in the first
quarter, partly supported by activity related to the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. Near-
term indicators, although mixed, have improved somewhat and also point to moderate
gains in the first half of this year. In particular, the new orders index from the ISM
manufacturing survey rose in February to its highest level since April 2011, and the
three-month moving average of the staff’s estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders
increased 1 percent in January.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The contour of the medium-term projection for real GDP growth is similar to the
one in the January Tealbook, as the effects of changes to our key conditioning
assumptions have been offsetting on net. On the downside, we now expect fiscal policy
to impose more restraint on economic growth than we projected in January, and the
upward revision to the exchange value of the dollar is anticipated to hold down exports.

On the upside, though, we have marked up our forecasts for house prices and the stock u t
O
market, and revised down slightly our projection for oil prices. In addition, we have
&
upgraded our outlook for domestic oil production in the medium term considerably, as we e l
v
e
have taken on board the Department of Energy’s view that domestic oil production is D
n
likely to continue increasing over the next few years. o
c
E
c
i
All told, real GDP is now projected to expand 2½ percent this year, a modest step t
s
e
up from the 1¾ percent pace of last year.6 Our forecast then calls for growth in real GDP m
o
D
to move up a little further to an average pace of 3½ percent in 2014 and 2015. In an
environment of highly accommodative monetary policy, this gradual acceleration is
supported by an easing of a number of headwinds that have restrained growth in the past
several years. In particular, we expect the restraint from federal fiscal policy to diminish
after this year. Also, European financial and economic conditions are projected to
improve gradually over the next several years, supporting an acceleration in exports.
Moreover, lenders should gradually increase the availability of mortgage credit to a
broader range of homebuyers as capacity constraints ease over time and regulatory
uncertainty around mortgage finance is reduced. In sum, these developments are
expected to lead to a growing sense among households and firms that threats to the
recovery have diminished, which should, in turn, help lower asset risk premiums and
boost consumer and business confidence, contributing to greater household consumption
as well as business investment and hiring.
The sector where the projected pickup in economic activity is most evident is
consumer spending. Real PCE is expected to rise 2½ percent this year before stepping up
to 3¼ percent in 2014 and 3¾ percent in 2015. We anticipate that this acceleration will
be supported by rising disposable incomes (stemming from ongoing improvements in the
labor market) and improving consumer confidence as well as by increases in household
wealth. The projected path of real PCE is little changed, on net, from the January
Tealbook.
Smaller declines in government purchases also contribute to the projected
acceleration in real GDP after this year. In particular, we expect the drag from federal
government purchases to wane over the forecast period as the pace of fiscal consolidation
6 About half of this projected acceleration is due to the drought and Hurricane Sandy, which held
down real GDP in 2012 and is expected to boost growth in 2013 as damaged equipment and structures are
replaced and as farm output comes back to normal.

residential investment is projected to ease from a pace of 19 percent this year to an
average pace of 14 percent in 2014 and 2015. This recovery is noticeably weaker than
that seen in many previous housing recoveries, in part because mortgages will continue to
remain out of reach for some households.
Growth in E&S investment is expected to average 6¼ percent per year over the
medium term, supported by rising demand emanating from the consumer and foreign
sectors. Despite the modest acceleration that we project for business output, the increase
in capital expenditures is anticipated to be a little larger in 2013 than in 2014, as some
investment that may have been delayed last year due to heightened uncertainty about
Europe and about U.S. fiscal policy is resumed this year. Moreover, the expected
expiration of the 50 percent bonus depreciation provision at the end of this year pulls
forward some investment from next year into this year.
In the nonresidential building sector, we are projecting a modest increase in
spending growth over the medium term, as the strengthening in overall economic activity
leads to very gradual improvements in vacancy rates, commercial real estate prices, and
credit availability. By contrast, growth in drilling and mining investment is expected to
slow in the next two years after a few years of rapid increases. Overall, our forecast calls
for investment in real nonresidential structures to increase about 3¼ percent in each of
2014 and 2015.
Inventory investment and the external sector are both expected to be roughly
neutral for real GDP growth over the medium term. With little sign of inventory
imbalances, we expect nonfarm inventories to accumulate in line with final sales in the
next two years. Meanwhile, both exports and imports are projected to accelerate,
reflecting strengthening economic growth at home and abroad. Our forecast for real
exports is somewhat lower than in the January Tealbook forecast owing to the stronger
exchange value of the dollar. Also, the stronger dollar boosts import growth, but this

D
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION o n
c
E
Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve at a pace that is, at least c
i
t
s
e
by some metrics, stronger than we had expected. The unemployment rate moved down to m
o
7.7 percent in February, in line with our projection. But in the establishment survey, D
nonfarm employment came in higher than expected, averaging 180,000 jobs per month in
January and February, about the same as the upward-revised pace in the second half of
last year. Taking account of the annual revisions, the level of nonfarm payroll
employment in February surprised us to the upside by 330,000.7 Both the workweek for
February and the level of aggregate hours also came in somewhat higher than we
anticipated.
Forward-looking indicators of labor market activity are also consistent with
continued employment gains in coming months. Initial claims for unemployment
insurance have drifted down over the past few months and are now at their lowest level
since early 2008. Meanwhile, individuals’ expectations of future labor market conditions
brightened a bit in February. That said, the more restrictive picture for fiscal restraint
stemming from the federal sequestration suggests somewhat less hiring by private
contractors in the near term. We expect the effect of the spending sequestration on
federal payroll employment to be minimal as government agencies use furloughs rather
than layoffs to reduce spending. In all, we now look for employment gains to average
about 175,000 per month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 7.7 percent
over the next several months. Absent sequestration-related spending cuts, we estimate
that employment gains would average about 200,000 per month over the next several
months.
7 The January employment report released on February 1 included upward revisions to payroll
employment from several sources. First, the usual annual benchmark revision raised the level of total
nonfarm employment in March 2012 by nearly 425,000; we had anticipated most of this revision, on the
basis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary estimate announced in the fall. Second, payroll
employment growth from April to December 2012 was revised up by a cumulative 225,000 because of both
additional adjustments associated with the benchmark revision and the inclusion of additional survey
responses for November and December. Finally, new seasonal factors released with the January report
appear to have removed the residual seasonality in the payroll employment data that resulted from the
timing of the recent recession.

Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment u t
O
We have not changed our estimates of potential output, structural productivity, or &
l
the natural rate of unemployment in this projection.8 We continue to project the natural e
v
e
rate of unemployment to edge down from 6 percent in 2012 to 5¾ percent in 2015 as the D
n
degree of mismatch between labor demand and labor supply, which was elevated during o
c
E
the recession and early recovery, starts to ease. c
i
t
s
e
m
We estimate that potential output will rise by about 2 percent per year over the
o
D
projection period, a slightly faster pace than that seen in the past few years. This
acceleration is due to a step-up in capital deepening resulting from the post-recession
rebound in investment in E&S as well as to the projected decline in the natural rate.
The Outlook for the Labor Market and Productivity
We estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose only
¾ percent in 2012, only slightly above the pace in 2011. We have interpreted this
sluggish pace of growth as suggesting that firms have been gradually returning their
workforces to more sustainable levels after having been reluctant to hire new employees
earlier in the economic recovery. We currently estimate that actual productivity stood
about ½ percent above its longer-run trend in the fourth quarter, so we anticipate slower-
than-trend productivity growth in the near term as firms continue to make up for their
prior restraint by adding workers. Thereafter, productivity is expected to rise at its
structural pace.
Private job gains are projected to step up from 180,000 per month this year to
about 210,000 per month in 2014 and 260,000 per month in 2015 as real output
accelerates. With this pace of hiring, the unemployment rate moves down throughout the
medium term, ending 2015 at 6¼ percent. The forecasts for employment growth and the
unemployment rate are similar to those in the January Tealbook, and the unemployment
rate is still expected to drop below the Committee’s threshold of 6½ percent in the fourth
quarter of 2015.
8 The upward revision to domestic oil production did not change our projection for trend
productivity or potential output. Although labor productivity in the oil industry is higher than the average
of the rest of the nonfarm business sector, the revision to the forecast for oil production carries forward the
trend in production seen in the past few years. Consequently, we think that the projected trend in structural
multifactor productivity, which is informed by average increases in the past, was already consistent with
the steeper trajectory of oil production that is now incorporated in our forecast.

u t The top-right figure of the “Labor Market Developments and Outlook” exhibit
O
compares our unemployment projection with our projection from September 2012, when
&
e l the Committee first tied its asset purchase decisions to an improvement in the outlook for
v
e
D labor market conditions. The unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of last year was
n
o about ½ percentage point below our September Tealbook projection, and our current
c
E
forecast for the remainder of this year and next year is lower by about the same amount.
c
i
t
s By the fourth quarter of 2014, we now have the unemployment rate reaching 7.1 percent,
e
m
o down from the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed last August, the latest reading available to
D
the Committee at the time of the September FOMC meeting. Meanwhile, as shown in the
lower-right figure in the exhibit, the outlook for payroll employment growth past the first
half of this year has changed relatively little since September, in line with our little-
revised projection for output growth. That said, the level of payroll employment is higher
than in our September projection, reflecting the positive employment surprises in the
second half of last year as well as the benchmark revision.
Resource Utilization
We estimate that there is still a fair amount of slack in the economy. In the fourth
quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate stood 2 percentage points above our estimate of
the natural rate, while the level of real GDP was 4 percent below its potential level. In
the manufacturing sector, capacity utilization stood about 1¾ percentage points below its
long-run average.9 We project these gaps to narrow slowly throughout the medium-term
forecast as output rises somewhat faster than potential. Nevertheless, we still expect the
unemployment rate to be ½ percentage point above the natural rate and real GDP to be
1 percent below potential at the end of 2015.
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation
Recent data on consumer price inflation have come in about in line with our
expectations. Moreover, as the projection for resource utilization is little changed in this
Tealbook and inflation expectations are still projected to remain stable, the forecast for
inflation is also roughly unrevised.
9 There appears to be less slack in the manufacturing sector than in the broader economy, in part
because of unprecedented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010 as manufacturers shuttered
plants that had been underutilized for a long time. We estimate capacity in the industrial sector based
largely on survey data that attempt to capture the highest level of output that plants can sustainably
maintain based on realistic work schedules, assuming that inputs like materials and labor are sufficiently
available.

Gasoline prices rose a good bit more than expected in February, but since we u t
O
judge margins currently to be above their long-run average, we expect gasoline prices to
&
fall back in the near term on a seasonally adjusted basis. Smoothing through these e l
v
e
fluctuations, our forecast for the change in consumer energy prices over the first half of D
n
this year is roughly the same as in the January Tealbook. Over the medium term, we o
c
E
expect consumer energy prices to decline in line with the projected path of crude oil
c

We expect food price inflation to remain elevated in the first half of this year,
reflecting continued pass-through to retail prices of the sharp run-up in crop prices
associated with last summer’s drought. Although the CPI for food has surprised us to the
downside of late, we estimate that the higher crop prices have not yet been fully passed
on to consumer prices. Hence, our near-term forecast for food price inflation is only a
little lower than it was in the January Tealbook. We expect food price inflation to slow
after this year as the effects of last summer’s drought fade.
Given the recent appreciation of the dollar, we expect core import price inflation
to slow to only ½ percent in the second quarter following a projected rise of 1¾ percent
in the current quarter. Over the remainder of the projection period, we expect core
import price inflation to move back up to a pace of 1½ percent, in line with our forecast
for moderate dollar depreciation.
We expect core PCE prices to rise at an annual rate of about 1½ percent in the
first half of this year, up from a fourth-quarter pace that we think was held down by
several transitory factors, including residual seasonality in the price data and earlier
declines in import prices.10 Our current forecast for core inflation in the first half of this
year is a bit lower than the one in the January Tealbook due to lower-than-expected
estimates of nonmarket prices and to a reduction in Medicare payments to health-care
providers that we expect to be associated with the onset of the spending sequestration.
Recent readings on inflation expectations have remained in the relatively narrow
range occupied over the past several years. Median 5-to-10-year expected inflation from
the Michigan survey ticked up to 3 percent in February. Meanwhile, expectations for
PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by the Survey of Professional
10 We suspect that residual seasonality exists in the price data because, for the past several years,
there has been a pattern of low inflation late in the year followed by higher readings early in the next year.

n With stable long-run inflation expectations, relatively small projected movements
o

E in commodity and import prices, and persistent slack in resource utilization, we expect
c

t core inflation to remain in the range of 1½ to 1¾ percent through 2015, essentially
s

m
unchanged from the January projection. In all, total PCE prices are anticipated to
o
D
increase 1¼ percent this year and 1½ percent in both 2014 and 2015. Thus, throughout
the medium term, the projection for PCE inflation remains well below the Committee’s
threshold level of 2½ percent.
Recent data on labor compensation have remained soft overall, about in line with
our January Tealbook forecast. The employment cost index rose at an annual rate of
2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, close to the average rate observed over the
past three years. By contrast, compensation per hour (CPH) in the nonfarm business
sector increased at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher
than its three-year average. However, this higher-than-expected reading mainly reflects
the BEA’s assumption that anticipated tax increases caused some bonuses to be paid late
last year rather than in the first quarter of this year.11 Consequently, our projection for
CPH growth in the first quarter is lower than in the January Tealbook. Smoothing
through the volatility around the turn of the year, our forecast for CPH growth is little
changed since the January Tealbook, with growth in compensation projected to pick up
slowly over the medium term as the labor market gradually tightens.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the FRB/US
model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and
11 The employment cost index (ECI) does not show a surge in bonus payments late last year,
possibly indicating that they were distributed after the mid-December ECI survey date. In addition, a large
fraction of the bonuses may have been paid to top executives who are not included in the ECI survey if the
Bureau of Labor Statistics determines that they set their own pay.

other factors. The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key u t

assumptions:
&
l
e
v
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer e
D
term, consistent with the Committee’s strategy statement as reiterated at the n
o
c
January meeting. As noted earlier, the Committee’s threshold for the E
c
i
unemployment rate is crossed in the baseline projection in late 2015. t
s
e
m
Thereafter, the federal funds rate is set according to the inertial Taylor (1999)
o
D
rule.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2016 and 2017, albeit to a
diminishing extent. By late 2018, the process of portfolio normalization is
essentially complete.
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds continue to decrease gradually
to normal levels, and financial institutions further ease their lending standards.
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) begins to widen after
2016, primarily reflecting fast-rising transfer payments for retirement and
health-care programs. Federal debt stabilizes temporarily at a little below
75 percent of GDP but then begins to edge up later in the decade.
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 1¾ percent per year
from 2016 to 2018 and moves down more slowly thereafter. The price of
crude oil declines slightly in 2016 and then holds steady in real terms.
Foreign real GDP growth is 3¼ percent in 2016 and 2017 and slows to a
3 percent annual rate late in the decade.
 The natural rate of unemployment continues to decline in 2016 and 2017,
from 5¾ percent at the end of 2015 to 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter of
2017, as labor market functioning improves further; it remains at that level in
the longer run. Potential GDP increases at an average annual rate of just over
2 percent in the 2016–20 period and moves up to a 2¼ percent pace in the
longer run.
The economy is projected to enter 2016 with output below its potential level,
unemployment above its natural rate, and inflation below the long-run objective of the

International Economic Developments and Outlook
With nearly all of the 2012 GDP releases in hand, we now estimate that foreign
output expanded a modest 2 percent in the fourth quarter, a touch less than we had
assumed in the January Tealbook. Growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs)
was stronger than we had projected, notably in Asia where trade flows were unexpectedly
robust. However, this positive surprise was more than offset by an unanticipated
contraction in the output of the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). In particular,
Europe experienced a more pronounced fourth-quarter GDP drop than we had foreseen,
k
o
and Canada remained in a soft patch due to an unexpectedly large deceleration in o
l
t
u
inventories. O
&
l
Recent indicators suggest that foreign growth strengthened somewhat following e
v
e
the turn of the year, with foreign GDP estimated to be rising 2¾ percent in the current D
n
quarter. This pickup is driven by improved performance in the AFEs, with data on o
c
E
production and exports suggesting some firming this quarter in both Japan and Canada. l
’
t
n
Additionally, PMIs suggest that the pace of contraction in euro-area GDP is slowing. We I
expect economic activity in the EMEs to expand at roughly the same solid rate this
quarter as in the last, although we see a step-down in the recent rapid growth in emerging
Asia, notably in China, being offset by an increase in Latin America.
Europe’s exit from recession is likely to proceed more slowly than we had
envisioned in the January Tealbook, however. In part, this revision reflects our read of
the incoming data, which point to a deeper contraction in European output. In addition,
European financial conditions have deteriorated some in the wake of Italy’s inconclusive
national election, and we expect that Italy’s struggles to put together an effective
government will weigh on financial markets and business confidence for some time.
More generally, the uncertainty resulting from Italy’s election highlights the euro area’s
continuing vulnerability to shocks. The severe European crisis scenario explored in the
Risks and Uncertainty section is still a material tail risk.
All told, we project total foreign economic growth to strengthen further over the
remainder of the forecast period, averaging 3 percent this year and increasing to
3½ percent by 2015. The strengthening is concentrated in the AFEs, where output should
accelerate as the euro-area crisis abates, fiscal drag diminishes, and monetary policies

remain accommodative. Growth in the EMEs is slated to stay around 4¾ percent during
the period, near its trend pace. Our forecast for total foreign growth is a little lower than
in the January Tealbook for this year, mainly reflecting a slightly gloomier outlook for
Europe.
Foreign inflation held steady at 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, in line with the
January Tealbook. It should remain near that rate throughout this year, restrained by
limited commodity price pressure and, in some countries, substantial resource slack.
Some EME central banks, including the Bank of Mexico, have cut their policy rates since
the January Tealbook because of economic growth concerns. In the AFEs, we now
k
o
expect more accommodative monetary policies mainly because of weaker growth,
o
l
t
u including an additional rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) and an expansion of
O
& the quantitative easing program of the Bank of England (BOE). But most notably, we see
l
e the Bank of Japan (BOJ), under new leadership, undertaking more aggressive actions to
v
e
D end deflation. Exactly how much additional easing will be undertaken by AFE central
n
o banks is uncertain, and in the Risks and Uncertainty section we explore the effects of
c
E
l stronger monetary stimulus abroad than we assume in our baseline forecast. In the box
’
t
n
I “Currency Wars,” we also consider some of the controversies surrounding monetary
easing by the advanced economies.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
Real GDP in the AFEs is expected to increase almost 1 percent at an annual rate
in the current quarter after a surprising decline of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Soft
economic indicators and elevated financial stresses suggest that economic activity in
Europe will remain quite subdued in the near term. In Japan, by contrast, a substantial
depreciation of the yen over the past few months, along with prospective fiscal and
monetary easing, should support an economic rebound this year. We anticipate that
fading financial stresses, reduced drag from fiscal consolidation, and a firming of U.S.
activity should lift AFE output growth to a little more than 1¼ percent this year, 2 percent
in 2014, and 2¼ percent in 2015. This outlook is a touch weaker than in the January
Tealbook.
Recent data suggest that AFE inflation has moderated from 1.6 percent in the
fourth quarter to an estimated ¾ percent in the current quarter, a figure somewhat below
our January Tealbook projection because of lower-than-expected readings in Canada and

the euro area. We continue to forecast inflation to average about 1¼ percent over the
remainder of 2013 before picking up slightly during the following two years.
Euro Area
Euro-area real GDP contracted 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, 1 percentage
point worse than we had estimated in the January Tealbook, with declines widespread
across core and peripheral economies. Recent indicators suggest that the pace of
contraction is moderating, although less so than we had anticipated. In January, retail
sales rebounded and consumer and business confidence edged up, but car registrations
dropped. The euro-area composite PMI remained in contractionary territory through
k
o
February despite rising above its fourth-quarter average. Moreover, bank lending o
l
t
u
standards continued to tighten, and loans to nonfinancial corporations decreased further. O
&
l
e
Financial tensions in the euro area have increased a bit on balance since the v
e
D
January Tealbook. While sovereign spreads declined somewhat, on net, for Ireland and
n
o
Spain, spreads on Italian 10-year government bonds are up significantly in the wake of
c
E
the country’s inconclusive parliamentary election. At present, expectations are for a l
’
t
n
weak caretaker government to take power until new elections can be held later this year, I
which could result in a stronger coalition. The prolonged uncertainty should not
compromise fiscal consolidation efforts already under way for 2013. However, a weak
government may struggle to implement needed structural reforms and credibly commit to
fiscal consolidation for future years, which raises questions about how quickly Italy could
obtain ECB support via Outright Monetary Transactions if necessary. As a result, area-
wide financial stresses and volatility will probably remain a little higher than envisioned
in the January Tealbook, but they should subside when Italy’s political situation settles
and further progress toward fiscal and structural reform is made in the other peripheral
countries.
All told, we revised down our projection for euro-area output growth a little more
than ¼ percentage point this year and a touch in 2014. We see GDP contracting a further
¾ percent in the current quarter, bottoming out later this year, and accelerating over the
forecast period to a 2 percent pace by 2015.
We expect inflation to step down from 2¼ percent in 2012 to 1¼ percent this year
as the output gap widens further and retail energy prices decelerate. The projected
recovery in activity should lift inflation to 1¾ percent by 2015. Despite the soft outlook

Currency Wars
In recent weeks, there has been much discussion about the possibility that several
advanced economies might engage in a “currency war,” seeking to devalue their
currencies through accommodative monetary policies. Brazilian Finance Minister Guido
Mantega is generally credited with coining the term currency wars in November 2010,
following the initiation of the Federal Reserve’s second LSAP program. At that time,
authorities in several EMEs criticized policy easing in the advanced economies as
encouraging excessive capital inflows that put upward pressure on EME currencies and
asset prices. However, as economic growth in the EMEs slowed last year, prompted in
part by renewed weakness in the advanced economies, these criticisms became more
k
o muted.
o
l
t
u
More recently, complaints about currency wars have reemerged following the sharp
O
depreciation of the yen since last fall, when it became clear that Shinzo Abe would be
&
elected prime minister of Japan. Abe called for aggressive monetary stimulus to help
l
e
v Japan escape deflation and discussed currency intervention, including the possible
e
D creation of a Japanese government fund to buy foreign assets. Some European officials
n were vocal in their concerns about policies that depreciate the yen. Bundesbank
o
c President Jens Weidmann showed alarm at the Japanese government’s urging of more
E
l aggressive monetary stimulus and expressed the hope that competitive devaluations
’
t
n could be avoided. French President François Hollande said he feared the euro’s strength
I
against other currencies and suggested setting a medium-term exchange rate target.
Following their most recent meeting on February 12, the G-7 central bankers and finance
ministers committed to refrain from actions focused on achieving competitive advantage
through lower currencies: “We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been
and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using
domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates.”1 Since then, Japanese
policymakers have dialed down public discussion of exchange market intervention or
purchases of foreign assets to stimulate their economy.
Similarly, the G-20 (which includes a broader range of countries) issued a communiqué on
February 16, which noted: “We will refrain from competitive devaluation. We will not
target our exchange rates for competitive purposes, will resist all forms of protectionism
and keep our markets open.”2 But in fact, the exchange rate policies of emerging market
countries are varied. Some (most prominently China) heavily manage their currencies,
often keeping them at levels that are generally considered undervalued. Others
(including Brazil and Korea) occasionally intervene in foreign exchange markets,
following an exchange rate policy that is described as a managed, or “dirty,” float. Still
others (including Mexico) allow their exchange rates to move more flexibly. There is also
a range of exchange rate policies among smaller advanced economies. Recently, the

governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has said that the New Zealand
dollar is clearly overvalued and that the RBNZ stands ready to intervene. Most explicitly,
in September 2011 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) imposed a ceiling on the Swiss franc in
response to safe-haven flows that sharply appreciated the franc during the height of the
euro-area crisis. While clearly targeting the exchange rate, that action generally escaped
criticism because the SNB had few other tools to combat deflation and the franc was
seen as overvalued.
By our reckoning, the accommodative monetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve,
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank have indeed
been focused on easing domestic financial conditions rather than on depreciating their
currencies, consistent with the G-7 statement. These policies contribute to the expansion
of global demand. At the same time, however, these policies do exert some downward
k
pressure on home currencies, which can have an adverse effect on trading partners. The o
o
net result for other countries will depend on the balance of these effects. To evaluate l
t
u
that balance, an alternative simulation discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section O
explores the effects on the United States and the EMEs of a simultaneous increase in &
monetary accommodation among the advanced foreign economies. This l
e
accommodation combines (1) balance sheet expansion sufficient to reduce the term v
e
premium in long-term interest rates by 50 basis points and (2) an intention, understood D
by markets, to extend by about two quarters the period during which short-term interest n
o
rates stay near the zero bound. As shown in the figure on the lower left, the net effect c
E
on GDP in the United States and the EMEs is quite small, as the adverse effect on ouput l
’
t
of the resulting appreciation of their currencies (lower-right figure) is offset by the n
I
stimulative effect of rising incomes and demand in the countries undertaking monetary
easing.
These results suggest that monetary easing is not a beggar-thy-neighbor policy that
detracts from economic growth in a country’s trading partners. Some observers are
concerned that if weakness in the global economy continues, the temptation to resort to
policies genuinely focused on exchange rates or trade protectionism might intensify. So
far, however, countries have generally resisted such actions.

for both inflation and activity, the ECB left its benchmark policy rate at 0.75 percent in
February. Nonetheless, given the larger output gap and ECB projections showing
inflation falling well below target, we now expect the ECB to cut its main policy rate to
0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2013 and then hold the rate steady until the second
half of 2015.
United Kingdom
Real GDP contracted 1 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly more than we
estimated in the January Tealbook, as inventories decelerated and final demand
k languished. The near-term outlook has also deteriorated amid disappointing domestic
o
o
l indicators and weaker growth prospects in the euro area, although the recent depreciation
t
u
O of sterling should damp the effect on aggregate demand. In January, retail sales
&
contracted for a fourth consecutive month and industrial production tumbled to a two-
l
e
v
e decade low. In addition, the composite PMI stalled near 50 through February.
D
n Accordingly, we shaved ¼ percentage point off our GDP growth forecast for this year,
o
c with output now barely increasing this quarter and expanding a modest 1½ percent, on
E
l
t ’ average, over the remainder of 2013. As in the January Tealbook, we expect growth to
n
I
rise to 2¼ percent in 2014 and to 2½ percent in 2015, helped by continued favorable
monetary conditions, smaller fiscal drag, and the projected recovery in the euro area.
We marked up our inflation forecast a bit following warnings by U.K. authorities
that power plant closings and increased reliance on higher-priced foreign oil and gas
would exert upward pressure on retail energy prices in coming years. We now expect
inflation to average 2¼ percent this year before edging down to the BOE’s 2 percent
target over the remainder of the forecast period. BOE officials appear willing to tolerate
above-target inflation over the next year or two, and press reports indicate that the central
bank’s remit may be modified in a way that places a greater emphasis on growth. In this
context, and given weaker GDP growth prospects, we are assuming that this year the
BOE will increase its quantitative easing program £50 billion (3.2 percent of GDP) and
expand the Funding for Lending Scheme.
Canada
Canadian real GDP rose only 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, about the same
pace as in the third quarter and ¾ percentage point less than we had estimated in the
January Tealbook. Economic activity was held down by a surprisingly large deceleration
40 of 104

in inventories, while consumption and investment grew at a moderate pace. Recent data
suggest that output growth is picking up modestly this quarter. Exports advanced in
January, and aggregate hours posted a solid gain in February. However, the PMI was
consistent with a meager expansion of manufacturing output through February.
Moreover, Statistics Canada’s annual survey of investment intentions was also downbeat.
Given these developments, our GDP growth projection is slightly lower over the forecast
period relative to the January Tealbook; we forecast GDP growth to rise from 2 percent
in 2013 to 2¾ percent by 2015, in line with the firming in U.S. GDP growth.
Canadian consumer price inflation was softer than expected in January due to
k
surprising weakness in both retail energy and core components. We now expect inflation o
o
l
t
to moderate to an annual rate of 1 percent this quarter, down from 1.4 percent in the u
O
fourth quarter. Inflation should rise to around 1¾ percent by early 2014 as economic &
l
activity improves and remain near that rate over the remainder of the forecast period. e
v
e
Against this backdrop of slow growth and low inflation, we now expect the Bank of D
n
Canada to push back its first policy rate hike by one quarter, keeping the rate at 1 percent o
c
E
until the third quarter of 2014.
l
’
t
n
I
Japan
Following two quarters of negative growth, Japanese real GDP edged up
0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, as a drag from plummeting exports was offset by a solid
increase in private consumption. Recent data suggest that external demand is recovering.
Industrial production and exports rose in January, and the manufacturing PMI and other
surveys suggest further gains in February. We thus estimate that output is expanding at a
1¾ percent pace in the current quarter. Growth should then pick up to 2¼ percent by
year-end, driven by previously announced measures to boost public investment.
Thereafter, a planned doubling of the consumption tax rate phased in over two years
should slow GDP growth to a near-trend pace of ¾ percent in 2014 and 2015. This
outlook is ¼ percentage point stronger than in the January Tealbook, with much of the
revision due to a further decline in the yen, higher stock prices, and our expectation for
greater monetary easing.
At the end of February, the Abe government nominated Haruhiko Kuroda to head
the BOJ. Pending parliamentary approval, Mr. Kuroda and two new deputy governors
will take office on March 20. Under their leadership, we expect the BOJ to announce
new easing measures, including an increase in the size of the Asset Purchase Program

(APP), an extension of the maturity of Japanese government bonds acquired through the
APP, and guidance as to how long open-ended purchases will last. Accordingly, we
revised up our inflation forecast ¼ percentage point over the forecast period. However,
we remain skeptical about the BOJ’s resolve and ability to achieve its new 2 percent
inflation target over the forecast period, and we project that, net of the effect of
consumption tax hikes, inflation will reach only ½ percent by the end of 2015.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
We estimate that real GDP growth in the EMEs increased to 4½ percent in the
k
o fourth quarter from 3¼ percent in the third quarter, with growth firming in both Latin
o
l
t
u America—especially Mexico—and emerging Asia. Final domestic demand remained
O
& strong, inventories rose sharply in some countries, and exports were surprisingly robust,
l
e considering the weakness in the advanced economies. Overall, our fourth-quarter
v
e
D estimate for EME growth is ½ percentage point higher than in the January Tealbook,
n
o reflecting positive surprises in emerging Asia and Mexico.
c
E
l
’
t
n We expect EME growth to remain at 4½ percent in the current quarter, with some
I
moderation in emerging Asia balanced by a step-up in Latin America. Over the
remainder of the forecast period, we see EME output growth hovering around
4¾ percent. Relative to the January Tealbook, our GDP forecast is down marginally
because of the slightly weaker outlook for the advanced economies and somewhat softer-
than-expected monthly indicators from China. We would add that some of the EMEs’
recent rebound in inventories and output may have been predicated on an anticipated
firming of demand by the advanced economies. If that recovery does not materialize
within the next several quarters, activity in the EMEs might fall back abruptly.
We estimate that headline inflation in the EMEs will move up to 3¼ percent in the
first quarter, about ½ percentage point higher than we projected in the January Tealbook,
largely because of a jump in Chinese inflation driven by food prices. Thereafter, EME
inflation should stabilize around 3¼ percent, in line with our January forecast. Mainly on
growth concerns, the central banks of Colombia, India, and Mexico cut their policy rates.

China
Indicators from China point to an easing of economic growth from 9½ percent in
the fourth quarter to 8½ percent in the current quarter.1 Over January and February,
growth of industrial production and retail sales slowed a bit. Investment remained strong,
led by the real estate sector, but we anticipate that investment will also slow as authorities
clamp down on speculation in the real estate market, in part by implementing a
20 percent capital gains tax on all residential property sales. We look for GDP growth to
decrease a bit further to 8 percent by the end of 2015, largely reflecting a gradual
reduction in China’s growth potential. The forecast for this year and next is down a bit
from the January Tealbook, reflecting the softer tone of the recent data and some reversal k
o
o
of earlier policy stimulus. Still, compared with early last year, when the Chinese l
t
u
O
economy was decelerating rapidly, a hard landing now seems less likely. However, the
&
new measures to cool the property market could lead to a steeper-than-expected decline l
e
v
in investment, and the recent rapid expansion of off-balance-sheet banking activities e
D
could pose a risk to financial stability. n
o
c
E
l
Chinese inflation picked up in January and February mainly because of an t ’
n
I
increase in vegetable prices. The rise in food prices led us to mark up our forecast for
headline inflation in the first quarter 1¼ percentage point to 3¾ percent at an annual rate.
We project Chinese inflation to moderate after the effects of the food price shock wane
and to average about 3 percent over the remainder of the forecast period.
Other Emerging Asia
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, real GDP growth climbed to 4½ percent in the
fourth quarter from 3 percent in the third. This pace is ¾ percentage point faster than
projected in the January Tealbook, as positive surprises in most of the region outweighed
disappointing readings in India and Korea. The largest upward surprises were in
Thailand and Malaysia, where output growth reached double-digit territory. Activity in
the region continued to be supported by domestic demand. In addition, growth was
boosted by exports to China, both to meet strong Chinese final demand and to provide
parts and components used in the production of goods for re-export. In Singapore and
1 There is no official series for the level of Chinese real GDP, and thus estimates of Chinese
economic growth from various sources can differ. The staff’s quarter-on-quarter growth estimates are
constructed from the official series of four-quarter changes in real GDP and should be viewed as having
relatively wide confidence bands.

Thailand, a sharp increase in inventory accumulation also raised activity in the fourth
quarter.
We expect growth in the region to step down to just above 4 percent in the current
quarter, reflecting a moderation in those economies that experienced outsized expansions
in the fourth quarter. Thereafter, growth should pick up to 4¾ percent by the end of
2014, supported by accommodative policies and the recovery of activity in the advanced
economies. Relative to the January Tealbook, our forecast is up ¼ percentage point in
the current quarter on increased economic momentum. The outlook is down a touch for
the rest of the year and in 2014 due to the downward revision to the pace of recovery in
k
o
the advanced economies.
o
l
t
u
O
Price readings have been coming in about as expected. Accordingly, we project
&
e l inflation in the region to remain at 3¼ percent in the current quarter and to stay near that
v
e
D rate over the remainder of the forecast period, in line with our previous Tealbook
n
o forecast. Concerns about house price bubbles prompted authorities in Hong Kong and
c
E
Singapore to introduce additional tightening measures for property markets.

Latin America
Real GDP growth in Mexico picked up to 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, almost
1 percentage point more than projected in the January Tealbook. Although industrial
output edged down, services output, which represents about two-thirds of the economy,
expanded at a moderate pace and output in the volatile agricultural sector jumped.
Manufacturing exports edged up in January and vehicle production through February
rebounded from its December slump. Combining these readings with the projected
improvement in U.S. manufacturing, we expect economic growth to increase further this
quarter to 3¾ percent and to remain near that pace through 2015. This forecast is little
changed from the January Tealbook.
For South America, we estimate that real GDP growth increased to 3¼ percent in
the fourth quarter from 2¼ percent in the third quarter. We expect growth in the region
to stay at about this pace in the current quarter before edging up to 3¾ percent in 2014
and 2015. In Brazil, GDP rose 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, 1 percentage point less
than we had estimated, and the third-quarter expansion was also revised down to only
1½ percent. The weakness in the fourth quarter reflected still-sluggish investment, which
grew only modestly after four quarters of decline. Indicators for the current quarter, such
44 of 104

as industrial production and PMI, have strengthened and suggest a pickup in growth to
about 3 percent in the current quarter, though this is still ½ percentage point below our
January projection. We expect Brazilian growth to increase further to 4 percent next year
and to level off at that rate in 2015, supported by policy accommodation and the recovery
in the advanced economies.
We estimate that consumer price inflation in Mexico dipped to 2 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter, about ¼ percentage point below our January Tealbook
forecast, as food prices ebbed from their recent highs. With inflation having retreated
significantly and amid concerns about weak global growth and strong capital inflows, the
k
Bank of Mexico lowered its policy rate 0.5 percentage point to 4 percent, the first rate cut o
o
l
t
since mid-2009. We expect Mexican inflation to rebound to 3¼ percent later this year u
O
after food prices bottom out and to step up slightly further over the remainder of the &
l
forecast period. e
v
e
D
In South America, first-quarter inflation, at an estimated 5¾ percent, has n
o
c
moderated a bit less than we had anticipated in the January Tealbook. Inflation in the E
l
’
t
region should settle near 5¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, in part as n
I
inflationary pressures in Brazil ease. The Brazilian central bank kept its main policy rate
unchanged at its record-low 7.25 percent at its March meeting, citing persistently weak
growth, but indicated a tightening bias for the future given that 12-month inflation, at
6.3 percent in February, is near the upper limit of its target range of 2½ to 6½ percent.
Accordingly, we expect the central bank to start tightening in coming months.

Financial Developments
Generally favorable U.S. economic data releases and monetary policymakers’
communications supported continued improvement in domestic market sentiment over
the intermeeting period despite some renewed concerns about conditions in Europe. On
balance, broad U.S. stock price indexes rose 3 percent over the period, while longer-term
Treasury yields ticked higher and corporate bond and MBS spreads were essentially
unchanged. The passing of the sequestration deadline and uncertainty over the extension
of the continuing resolution to fund the federal government left little apparent imprint in
domestic asset markets. The dollar appreciated against the major currencies amid
weaker-than-expected foreign economic data releases and anticipation of easier monetary
policy conditions abroad. Equity prices of European financial institutions dropped and
Italian sovereign spreads widened in response to heightened political uncertainty
following the inconclusive outcome of the Italian elections.
The expected path of policy rates implied by derivatives contracts edged down, on
net, since the January FOMC meeting. On balance, various communications from
policymakers, including the Chairman’s semiannual testimony to the Congress, were
characterized as reinforcing market expectations that significant monetary policy
s
accommodation would continue. t

Conditions in domestic financing markets generally improved, on net, over the o

intermeeting period. There was no apparent deterioration in access to short-term funding, v

including for financial institutions with European parents. Meanwhile, credit flows to

nonfinancial businesses remained robust, as evidenced by elevated net domestic c

loans. Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to
improve slowly, with commercial mortgage debt increasing in the fourth quarter for the
first time since 2008. On the household side, student and auto loans continued to expand
briskly, while other credit flows to the household sector remained subdued. In particular,
despite another sizable increase in house prices, residential mortgage debt outstanding
was little changed in the fourth quarter amid persistently tight credit conditions for many
households, and balances owed on credit card accounts have been flat in recent months.
Meanwhile, overall bank credit continued to expand moderately, driven primarily by the

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
Over the intermeeting period, the expected path for federal funds rates derived
from market quotes edged down, while longer-term Treasury yields were relatively
unchanged on net. On balance, FOMC communications were slightly more
accommodative than expected. Although some market participants viewed the minutes
of the January FOMC meeting as signaling marginally less policy accommodation
through the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet than they had expected, the January FOMC
statement, the Chairman’s monetary policy testimony, and a number of speeches by
FOMC members appeared to more than offset that interpretation and reinforced
expectations for a continuation of significant policy accommodation. The expected path
for the federal funds rate derived from overnight index swaps now rises above the current
target range in the fourth quarter of 2014, one quarter later than at the time of the January
FOMC meeting. The modal policy path—the most likely values for future federal funds
rates based on prices of interest rate caps—indicates that the federal funds rate will
remain in its current range until early 2016, slightly longer than seen in January.1
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Dealers also show
s
t
a small downward revision in modal policy rate expectations beyond the first quarter of n
e
m
2015, although dealers continued to view the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time p

of the first increase in the target rate. Median estimates suggest that dealers also e l

Nominal Treasury yields stayed within a narrow range during the first half of the
intermeeting period but declined noticeably in response to the deterioration in sentiment
following the inconclusive elections in Italy. The decline in yields was subsequently
retraced as domestic data releases on housing and labor market activity exceeded
expectations. On net since the January FOMC meeting, 2-year Treasury yields ticked
down 2 basis points, while 10- and 30-year yields rose 2 basis points and 7 basis points,
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 15 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

TREASURY AND AGENCY MBS MARKET FUNCTIONING
The Desk’s flow-based purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS
continued to proceed as planned and did not appear to have had any material adverse
effect on either Treasury or agency MBS market functioning.2 Most measures of
liquidity conditions in these markets, such as bid-asked spreads for nominal Treasury
securities and trading volumes and settlement fails for both types of securities, remained
stable over the intermeeting period. Implied financing rates for dollar roll transactions in
most MBS coupons have risen over the period, suggesting little scarcity in the supply of
the cheapest-to-deliver MBS that trade in the to-be-announced (TBA) market. Implied
financing rates for Fannie Mae 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent MBS coupons were quite
negative in January, suggesting a short-term shortage of such securities in the TBA
market, but rose over the period, as supply in these coupons increased and the Desk’s
purchases shifted somewhat toward other securities that were in relatively greater supply.
Consequently, the Desk rolled only about 8 percent of total expected settlements in
February, about half the January level.

European financial institutions remained stable in the period following a significant
increase in issuance at the beginning of the year, and the outstanding amount of
unsecured CP issued by U.S. financial institutions was also about unchanged. The
spreads on U.S. and most European unsecured CP and asset-backed commercial paper
(ABCP) generally held at their recent levels. Aggregate outstanding ABCP was little
changed for programs with sponsors domiciled in the United States and Europe.
Overnight spreads on ABCP (relative to AA-rated unsecured nonfinancial CP) were
about unchanged, on net, with spreads on most European ABCP issues remaining close to
those on U.S. issues.
Repo markets continued to function well over the intermeeting period. Rates on
Treasury and agency GCF repo increased from their low levels at the time of the January
FOMC meeting but remained below their six-month averages. Repo haircuts for
Treasury and agency collateral, as well as for corporate bond collateral, were roughly
unchanged. The availability of term secured funding reportedly continued to increase,
including for less-liquid asset classes. Market participants noted that funding for
high-yield debt is now available to high-quality counterparties for tenors up to six
months, and from a broadening group of lenders.

OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Broad equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, as markets reacted
to generally better-than-expected domestic economic data releases and strong corporate
earnings reports despite the continued trimming of year-ahead earnings forecasts. The
staff’s estimate of the expected real return on the S&P 500 index edged down further
over the period to the lowest level seen since late 2008, while the spread between this
return and the real 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the current equity premium—
remained wide by historical standards. The VIX, an index of option-implied
one-month-ahead volatility for the S&P 500 index, jumped after the Italian elections but
subsequently fell to a level last seen in early 2007.
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade
corporate bonds rose slightly, roughly in line with yields on comparable-maturity
nominal Treasury securities. As a result, spreads for both classes of corporate bonds
were about unchanged, on net, for the period. The spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured
CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on AA-rated nonfinancial issues were about
unchanged, on balance, over the period.

Bank of England signaled that it was likely to maintain its accommodative monetary
policies even as it expects to miss its inflation target over the medium term. Sovereign
yields declined in the United Kingdom and Germany, and sterling and the euro
depreciated 6 percent and 3½ percent, respectively, against the dollar.

Expectations for easier monetary policy extended also to Canada and Japan.
Amid weak data on domestic economic activity, the Bank of Canada appeared more
likely to delay further the start of monetary tightening, and the Canadian dollar
depreciated 2½ percent against the U.S. dollar, on net, over the period.
In Japan, the nomination of Haruhiko Kuroda to lead the Bank of Japan reinforced
expectations for aggressive monetary policy action. Ten-year sovereign yields decreased
about 13 basis points in Japan, to near record lows, and the Nikkei index rose 13 percent
over the period. The yen depreciated a further 6 percent against the dollar, bringing the
yen’s decline against the dollar since last fall to 22 percent. This depreciation in
anticipation of more policy easing led to some fears that Japan would deliberately seek to
lower its currency and thereby induce retaliatory actions by other countries to devalue
their currencies. In response, the G-7 and G-20 issued statements reaffirming their
commitments to “market determined” exchange rates (see the box “Currency Wars” in
the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).
Although inflows into emerging market mutual funds continued, they slowed
notably in recent weeks, partly reflecting heightened stresses after the Italian elections,
and EME equity indexes were, on average, slightly lower. In China, the government
imposed new measures aimed at cooling activity in the housing market and proposed
measures to rein in the country’s shadow banking sector. The central banks of Colombia, s
t
n
Hungary, India, Mexico, and Poland lowered their respective policy interest rates over e

purchases from Asia, recovered in December and January from November’s low level;
Federal Reserve Bank of New York custodial data suggest more-moderate increases in
February.

BUSINESS FINANCE
After a strong finish to the fourth-quarter reporting season, earnings per share for
S&P 500 firms are now estimated to have increased modestly from the third-quarter
level. Gains for the nonfinancial sector more than offset a substantial decline in the
profits of insurance companies stemming in large part from payouts to cover damage
caused by Hurricane Sandy. Although revisions to year-ahead analyst earnings forecasts
for firms in the S&P 500 continued to be slightly negative in January and February,
analysts, on balance, continue to expect a healthy rate of earnings growth over the
coming year.
Available indicators also continued to point to solid credit quality for the
nonfinancial corporate sector. In the fourth quarter, the aggregate liquid asset ratio
remained near its highest level in 20 years, while the aggregate ratio of debt to assets
ticked lower and continues to be well below its historical average for the same period.
The volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds downgraded by Moody’s jumped in January,
primarily reflecting a downgrade to AT&T’s debt. Bond rating upgrades rebounded in
February to slightly exceed downgrades. The six-month trailing bond default rate for
nonfinancial firms remained low by historical standards in January, and the C&I loan
delinquency rate continued to decrease in the fourth quarter from an already low level.
The KMV expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms declined slightly in
s
t
n
recent months because of gains in share prices. e
m
p
o
Bond issuance by nonfinancial firms remained fairly robust in February, largely e l
v
e
due to continued sizable issuance from investment-grade firms. Staff estimates indicate D
l
that the net issuance of nonfinancial CP continued to be brisk, and the volume of C&I a
i
c
n
loans outstanding also grew, in February. Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans a
n
i
remained robust, supported by strong demand from CLOs, which has recently brought F
down yields on most tranches, bringing them more in line with other similarly rated debt
securities. The pace of CLO issuance hit a post-crisis high over the intermeeting period.
The pace of gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms picked up in
January, boosted by robust IPO activity and secondary issuance, and remained strong in
February. In the fourth quarter, share repurchases and cash-financed mergers by
nonfinancial firms continued their recent pace, leaving net equity issuance deeply
negative. Moreover, a notable pickup in announcements of both mergers and share

repurchase programs so far this year suggest that equity retirements are likely to
accelerate over the coming quarters.
Financial conditions in the CRE sector have improved of late. As low interest
rates have increased demand for commercial mortgages and lending standards reportedly
have eased somewhat, commercial mortgage debt increased slightly in the fourth quarter
after decreasing in each quarter since the beginning of 2009. Data from banks suggest
that growth in multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loans more than offset further
declines in construction and land development loans. Moreover, CMBS issuance
continues to be robust so far this year, reportedly driven by low interest rates and strong
investor demand. Nonetheless, delinquency rates on loans underlying existing CMBS
moved only a touch lower in February, remaining near historically high levels, while
CRE prices flattened out in the fourth quarter after several consecutive quarterly
increases.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Conforming home mortgage rates and yields on agency MBS have risen a bit, on
net, since the previous FOMC meeting, while the spread between primary and secondary
rates was little changed. Despite the fact that mortgage rates have increased by about
35 basis points, on net, this year, refinancing originations have declined only slightly, as

Consumer credit continued to expand moderately in December and January, with

and auto loans averaged annual rates around 10 percent in those two months. In contrast,
revolving credit was roughly flat amid continued tight underwriting standards for credit
card loans. Even so, credit card solicitation mail volume jumped noticeably in January,

another robust quarter, largely supported by strong investor demand for these securities.
GOVERNMENT FINANCE
Since the January FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned
$232 billion in nominal securities and $9 billion in 30-year TIPS. The auctions were
generally in line with expectations, with bid-to-cover ratios close to their recent averages.
The pace of gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds weakened in January
and is expected to slow further in February, largely owing to tepid issuance for new
capital projects. Moreover, net issuance of these bonds remained negative, as state and
local governments resisted taking on debt amid continued weakness in their credit
quality. The number of rating downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to
substantially outpace upgrades in the fourth quarter, and preliminary data suggest that
this trend may have continued in the current quarter. CDS spreads for states inched down
further over the intermeeting period, while the ratio of yields on 20-year municipal bonds
to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities—a gauge of the relative risk of
municipal bonds—was little changed.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
s
t
n
Bank credit continued to expand modestly in January and February—about e
m
p
matching its fourth-quarter pace, on average—largely driven by continued robust growth o
l
e
in C&I loans. CRE loans were about unchanged over that period, while moderate v
e
D
increases in closed-end residential mortgage loans were partially offset by continued
l
a
i
declines in home equity loans. Consumer loans have only inched up so far this year, c
n
a
reflecting limited changes in credit card loans and modest growth in other consumer n
i
F
loans. Finally, banks’ holdings of securities were about flat, as sizable declines in
Treasury and agency debt securities were offset by increases in agency MBS and other
securities.
In aggregate, the profitability of BHCs increased in the fourth quarter but
continued to run well below the levels that prevailed before the financial crisis.
Profitability was boosted last quarter by a moderate increase in noninterest income, as
revenues from investment banking activities such as underwriting rose. Net interest
margins (NIMs) at commercial banks narrowed and remained near the bottom of their

historical range, reflecting a downward trend in NIMs at the largest BHCs. In contrast,
NIMs at smaller banks with relatively high concentrations of real estate loans rose in the
fourth quarter and have risen, on net, over the past few years. Meanwhile, the industry as
a whole continued to release loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter, but to a lesser extent
than has been the case in some time. Credit quality at banks continued to show signs of
improvement in every major asset class. Regulatory capital ratios rose further, driven by
an increase in retained earnings.
According to the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in early
February, spreads of C&I loan rates over an interest rate on a market instrument of
comparable maturity continued to trend down. However, spreads on loans at large
domestic banks and foreign banks declined further, while spreads on loans originated at
small domestic banks increased. Likewise, spreads on loans made under smaller
commitments, a proxy for loans to small businesses, inched up and remained elevated,
while the spreads on loans made under larger commitments fell. These patterns are
generally consistent with an environment in which there has reportedly been greater
competition among banks to supply credit to large and middle-market firms.
The level of M2 was about unchanged, on net, over January and February.
Deposits rose rapidly in December as uncertainty about future tax rates reportedly
s spurred some investors to realize capital gains and some firms to increase dividend
t
n
e
m payments. The reversal of these flows due to portfolio rebalancing likely damped M2

In contrast, the monetary base has expanded at an annual rate of 37¾ percent

December 31, 2012, appeared to have little effect on deposit balances. Commercial bank Call Report data
for the fourth quarter of 2012 showed that these temporarily insured balances actually increased until the
point of expiration. Moreover, after expiration, there appeared to be no migration of deposit balances to
banks perceived as stronger or likely to be “too big to fail.” In fact, the largest 19 banks by assets have
seen deposit outflows since the turn of the year. Also, banks with higher credit ratings appear to have seen
relatively more outflows in January and February than a sampling of banks with comparatively lower credit
ratings.

to important classes of counterparties covered by the survey.1 Continuing a trend observed in
recent surveys, a large net fraction of respondents reported an increase in the amount of resources
and attention devoted to the management of concentrated exposures to central counterparties and
other financial market utilities. Overall, respondents noted that the use of financial leverage by
most classes of counterparties had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.
However, about one-fourth of dealers, including a majority of the nine broad-scope dealers—that
is, dealers with a significant presence in essentially all of the business areas covered in the
survey— reported an increase in the use of leverage by hedge funds.
As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in
new or renegotiated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives master agreements were generally
unchanged, on balance, during the past three months. Dealers also reported that initial margin
requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were generally little changed
over the same period.
While the credit terms applicable to the funding of the various types of securities covered
in the survey were reported to be little changed, on net, over the past three months, dealers
s
t
indicated that demand for funding had increased for a number of collateral types, particularly for n
e
m
securitized products. Almost two-thirds of respondents reported increased demand for funding of
p
non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), whereas about two-fifths noted o
l
e
increased demand for funding of agency RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities v
e

(CMBS). For a number of the collateral types covered by the survey, dealers characterized

1 The March survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. In
addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about the provision of
warehouse funding for commercial real estate loans and syndicated bank loans prior to securitization, and a
second set of special questions about client risk appetite. The 22 institutions participating in the survey
account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to nondealers and are the
most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was conducted during the period from
February 19, 2013, to March 4, 2013. The core questions ask about changes between December 2012 and
February 2013.

and under prevailing terms since the middle of 2012. About one-half of survey respondents also
indicated that demand for such interim funding for CRE and syndicated bank loans had increased
over the same period.
Finally, in response to a set of special questions about client risk appetite, dealers
reported that the appetite of most client types to bear investment risk had increased since the
beginning of 2013. In particular, nearly one-half of dealers, on net, noted an increase in the risk
appetite of their most-favored hedge fund customers, while about one-fourth of respondents
pointed to a similar increase for other hedge funds and insurance companies.
COUNTERPARTY TYPES
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
In the March survey, all but two respondents indicated that the amount of resources and
attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial
intermediaries remained basically unchanged over the past three months. (See the exhibit
“Management of Concentrated Credit Exposures and Indicators of Supply of Credit.”) The
fraction of dealers reporting an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to
management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries has declined
gradually from the 90 percent peak reached in the December 2011 survey.
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities
About three-fifths of dealers indicated that they had increased the amount of resources
and attention devoted to management of concentrated credit exposure to central counterparties
s
t
n and other financial utilities over the past three months, roughly the same share as in previous
e
m
surveys. About three-fourths of broad-scope dealers reported such an increase. In light of the
p
o implementation of new regulatory requirements mandating increased central clearing of many
l
e
v OTC contracts, continued focus on these exposures is perhaps unsurprising.2 About one-fifth of
e
D
survey respondents noted that the credit terms their firms applied to clients on bilateral
l
a

c

a central counterparties, including changes in margin requirements and haircuts.

Hedge Funds
As in December, respondents to the March survey generally indicated that both price
terms (such as financing rates) and nonprice terms (including haircuts, maximum maturity,
covenants, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation features) offered to
hedge funds for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had remained basically
2 As of March 11, 2013, central counterparty clearing became mandatory for major swap market
participants, including dealers and active funds. The mandated products include interest rate swaps,
forward rate agreements, overnight index swaps, basis swaps, and credit default swap indexes. The
immediate effect of the clearing rule on dealers’ counterparty exposures is likely to be limited because
many dealers have been reportedly submitting these trades for central clearing on a voluntary basis for
some time.

unchanged over the past three months. However, about one-fourth of respondents, including
two-thirds of broad-scope dealers, reported an increase in the use of financial leverage by hedge
funds over the past three months. (See the exhibit “Use of Financial Leverage.”) A few
broad-scope dealers also indicated that the availability of additional (and currently unutilized)
financial leverage under agreements currently in place with hedge funds had increased somewhat.
Nearly one-fourth of dealers further noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of
efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the same
period. A similar fraction noted that the provision of differential terms to most-favored hedge
funds had increased somewhat over the same period.
Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts
Most respondents to the March survey reported that price and nonprice terms offered to
trading real estate investment trusts (REITs) had remained basically unchanged over the past
three months.3 Respondents generally indicated that the use of financial leverage by trading
REITs had remained basically unchanged. Respondents also noted that both the intensity of
efforts by trading REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms and the provision
of differential terms to most-favored clients were broadly unchanged.
Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments
Respondents to the March survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to
mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, and endowments had remained
essentially unchanged over the past three months. Provision of differential terms to most-favored
clients and the intensity of efforts by clients to negotiate more-favorable terms were also reported
to be little changed, as was the use of financial leverage.

Nonfinancial Corporations
About one-fifth of respondents indicated that they had eased somewhat price terms
offered to nonfinancial corporations over the past three months; a couple of dealers also pointed
to an easing of nonprice terms. More than one-fourth of respondents reported an increase in the
intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice
terms.
Mark and Collateral Disputes
As in previous surveys, a large majority of respondents in March indicated that the
volume, persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type
included in the survey were little changed over the past three months. A few respondents,
however, reported a decline in the volume of mark and collateral disputes with dealers and other
financial intermediaries as well as with hedge funds, over the same period.
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES
As in previous surveys, most nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC
derivatives master agreements were reported to be basically unchanged, on net, over the past
three months. 4 However, in a departure from prior survey responses, one-fourth of dealers—
including some broad-scope dealers—reported a tightening in acceptable collateral, and one-fifth
of respondents also indicated that requirements, timelines, and thresholds for posting additional
margin had tightened somewhat over the past three months.
For all of the contract types included in the survey, nearly all of the dealers indicated that
s
t
n initial margins (which fall outside the scope of master agreements) were little changed over the
e

for funding of securitized products. Almost two-thirds of dealers reported increased demand for
funding of non-agency RMBS, while about two-fifths of respondents pointed to increased
demand for funding of agency RMBS and CMBS. In addition, net fractions of dealers ranging
between about one-fifth and one-fourth reported increased demand for funding of high-yield and
investment-grade corporate bonds and equities. Finally, respondents noted an increase in demand
for term funding—that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or more—for high-yield corporate
bonds, agency and non-agency RMBS, and CMBS.
Survey respondents characterized liquidity and functioning over the past three months as
improved in a number of markets. In particular, roughly one-fifth of respondents noted such an
improvement in the markets for CMBS, non-agency RMBS, consumer ABS, and high-yield
corporate bonds. 5 Finally, as in recent surveys, almost all of the respondents indicated that the
volume, duration, and persistence of market and collateral disputes were basically unchanged for
all of the collateral types.
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON WAREHOUSE FUNDING OF COMMERCIAL REAL
ESTATE AND SYNDICATED BANK LOANS PRIOR TO SECURITIZATION
A number of new CMBS issues and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have been
brought to market over the past nine months. In some cases, such primary market activities rely
on dealers providing funding for the collateral on an interim basis through “warehouse” lending
facilities prior to securitization. The first set of special questions in the March survey asked
dealers about the provision of warehouse funding for CRE loans and for syndicated bank loans.
With regard to CRE loans, about one-third of dealers that funded such loans on an interim s
t
n
basis through warehouse financing and similar secured facilities indicated that they had eased e
m
their terms on the loans somewhat since the middle of 2012. About one-fourth of respondents p
o
also noted an increase in their willingness to fund these loans on an interim basis at prevailing e l
v
market rates and under prevailing market terms over the same period. In addition, about one-half e
D
of dealers reported an increase in demand by their clients for funding CRE loans on an interim l
a
basis since the middle of 2012. All but one of these respondents were broad-scope dealers. c i
n
a
n
i
With respect to syndicated bank loans, the terms under which these loans are funded on F
an interim basis through warehouse financing and similar secured facilities were reported to have
remained basically unchanged since the middle of 2012. However, about one-third of dealers that
offered such funding indicated that they had become more willing to fund these loans on an
interim basis at prevailing market rates and under prevailing market terms. More than one-half of
respondents also reported an increase in demand for funding syndicated bank loans on an interim
basis since the middle of 2012. About one-half of these respondents were broad-scope dealers.
5 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself. This question is not asked with respect to
equity markets in the core questions.

client types to bear investment risk had increased. (See the exhibit “Client Risk Appetite.”) Most
notably, nearly one-half of dealers—including a majority of broad-scope dealers—on net,

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY
We now view the uncertainty around our projection for economic activity as
similar to the average level over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC).
Measures of uncertainty over that period are importantly influenced by the pronounced
volatility in activity during the recent recession.1 Uncertainty is comparable to this high
benchmark, in part, because of the persistent aftereffects of the recent financial crisis and
recession, which still have uncertain implications for the pace at which the recovery is
likely to proceed, the magnitude of slack in labor and product markets, and the resilience
of the financial system. We continue to view the risks to the projection for real activity
as skewed to the downside. Recent developments in the euro area highlight the fragility
of the reform process in several euro-area economies, and we still see a material risk that
the European situation could deteriorate markedly, with substantial spillover effects on
the U.S. economy. And, despite the resolution since December of some uncertainty, U.S.
fiscal policy could impose somewhat more restraint than we have assumed. Importantly,
U.S. monetary policy has limited capacity to counteract the effects of a severe economic
downturn in Europe, tighter fiscal policy, or any other factor that might unexpectedly
impose a significant drag on domestic economic activity. Finally, the disappointing pace
of GDP growth during the recovery might indicate greater supply-side damage than we
assume in our projection.
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but
do not view these risks as unusually high. Long-run inflation expectations and the trend
in actual inflation have remained stable in recent years despite large fluctuations in the
prices of crude oil and other commodities and persistently wide margins of slack in labor
and product markets. Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as
roughly balanced. On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations, potentially related
to concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to
y
t
n
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past a i
t
several years. In particular, as the fixed 20-year window used to assess the size of typical forecast errors e r
c
has moved forward to include the pronounced volatility during the past five years, the estimated standard n
U
errors for out-year projections of the unemployment rate have almost doubled. As a result, the benchmark
&
estimates of uncertainty about economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great
s
Moderation period. In contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially k
s
unchanged relative to earlier sample periods. R i

execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as
could a stronger-than-expected recovery. On the downside, weaker-than-anticipated
economic growth, coupled with falling commodity prices, could cause actual inflation to
decline; moreover, such developments, coupled with persistently low levels of resource
utilization, might prompt inflation expectations to drift down, amplifying the disinflation.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of the staff’s models. The first
scenario focuses on the possibility that a stronger recovery in residential construction and
house prices could spark broader improvements in the overall economy. The second
scenario considers the macroeconomic implications of an unexpectedly sharp increase in
long-term interest rates this year. The next two scenarios examine risks to the supply side
of the economy. In particular, the third scenario assumes that the natural rate of
unemployment declines to a greater extent than assumed in the baseline because a greater
number of the long-term unemployed leave the workforce permanently. The fourth
scenario explores a different way to explain a faster near-term decline in the
unemployment rate than we are projecting, namely that potential GDP is growing less
rapidly than we currently assume because of weaker structural productivity growth both
in the recent past and in the future. The final two scenarios consider risks to the domestic
economy from foreign economic developments—first, that the European crisis could
intensify with severe spillovers to the U.S. economy and, second, that monetary policy
abroad becomes more expansionary than assumed in the baseline.
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two
scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA model. In the FRB/US simulations, the federal
funds rate follows an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, subject to the thresholds
for the unemployment rate and inflation announced by the FOMC following its
December 2012 meeting. For the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy
rule, subject to the same unemployment and inflation thresholds but employing an
alternative concept of resource utilization.2 In all of the scenarios, we assume that the t y

size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. a

Housing-Led Recovery
The increases in house prices, housing starts, and home sales over the past year
may be pointing to a more robust recovery in the housing market than is assumed in the
baseline. Indeed, given the subdued rate of household formation for the past several
years, there may be scope for a very substantial increase in the demand for housing;
moreover, by some metrics house prices remain below their equilibrium levels,
suggesting that home values could appreciate somewhat more than assumed in the
baseline. In this scenario, a stronger housing recovery, along with reduced uncertainty
about the durability of the expansion more broadly, sparks a cycle of increased consumer
and business confidence, faster hiring, and improved financial conditions that leads to
stronger spending by households and firms. As a result, real GDP rises at an average
annual rate of around 4½ percent over 2013 and 2014, and the unemployment rate falls
below 6½ percent in the first half of 2014 and stands at 4¾ percent in late 2015—
½ percentage point below our estimate of the longer-run value of the natural rate. With
rapidly disappearing resource slack, unit labor costs eventually rise more rapidly than in
the baseline, pushing consumer price inflation up to a little over 2 percent in 2016 and
2017. The federal funds rate lifts off in mid-2014 and remains well above the baseline
thereafter.
Higher Long-Term Interest Rates
In the staff’s baseline forecast, long-term interest rates rise steadily and
substantially over the medium term, in part reflecting a rise in term premiums. But term
premiums could climb even more quickly than we project for any number of reasons,
including an increase in inflation risk premiums, a quicker and more substantial reversal
of safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasury securities than the staff anticipates, or an
unwinding of leveraged positions in anticipation of a cessation of asset purchases by the
Federal Reserve. In this scenario, yields on 10-year Treasury securities and BBB-rated
corporate bonds reach 3¾ percent and 6 percent, respectively, by early next year, roughly
a full percentage point above the baseline projection. The resulting tightening in overall
financial conditions shaves ½ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of real
GDP over the next three years, and the unemployment rate declines to only 7 percent by y
t
n
i
late 2015, ¾ percentage point above the baseline. Core PCE inflation remains around a
t
r
e
1½ percent until the end of 2016. Under these conditions, the first increase in the federal c
n
U
funds rate is delayed until the end of 2016.

Lower Natural Rate
We were surprised by the extent of the reduction in the unemployment rate last
year. In the January Tealbook, we responded to this surprise by trimming a small amount
off our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment in 2012 and this year. In this
scenario, we consider the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment declines
substantially faster than assumed in the baseline, and that it will reach 5¼ percent by late
2013—several years earlier than in the baseline. However, this more rapid decline in the
natural rate is not assumed to reflect an improvement in labor market functioning, but
instead to be the result of a greater number of the long-term unemployed permanently
leaving the labor force. The combination of a more rapidly falling natural rate and a
steeper downward trend in labor force participation implies little change in potential labor
input—and thus only a small revision from the baseline in potential GDP—through
2015.3 Under these conditions, real GDP and employment run close to the baseline, but
the unemployment rate declines more quickly and falls below its threshold value in
mid-2015. As a result, the federal funds rate begins to rise one quarter earlier than in the
baseline.
Supply-Side Damage
In the January Tealbook, we attributed much of the surprisingly rapid decline in
the unemployment rate during 2012 to somewhat lower potential output growth over
recent history. However, we may still be overestimating the growth rate of potential
GDP, perhaps because the financial crisis has caused greater structural damage than we
assume. In this scenario, the current level of potential output is 1 percent lower than in
the baseline because of smaller-than-estimated gains in structural productivity over the
past few years. Moreover, these smaller productivity gains continue, shaving
¼ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of potential GDP going forward.
As a result, real GDP rises only about 2½ percent per year, on average, in 2013 and 2014,
and economic growth remains below the baseline through 2017. Given the downward
revision to potential output in 2012 and beyond in this scenario, the output gap is
narrower, and, as a result, Okun’s law implies a more rapid decline in the unemployment
rate. With the unemployment rate falling below its threshold value in early 2015, the y

3 Alternatively, the natural rate of unemployment could decline because of an improvement in U
&
labor market functioning. In this case, the natural rate would fall but labor force participation would not,
s
resulting in higher potential output. As a result, GDP growth would be somewhat higher than in the k
s
“Lower Natural Rate” scenario, but the unemployment rate would be little different. R i

federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound two quarters earlier than
in the baseline.
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers
In this scenario, the improvements witnessed in European financial markets since
the middle of last year are assumed to be short-lived, and Europe plunges into another
bout of severe stress, much worse than that seen to date. While we think the likelihood of
such an outcome has declined, recent political events in Italy highlight that the European
situation remains fragile and could deteriorate sharply, possibly triggered by a disorderly
sovereign default, the failure of a large European financial institution, or a loss of
confidence by the public in the ability of European governments to resolve the crisis. In
this scenario, the greater stress prompts private and most sovereign borrowing costs in
Europe to soar, with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above the baseline; in
addition, the confidence of European households and businesses plummets. Real GDP in
Europe declines about 8 percent relative to the baseline by the second half of 2014,
despite a 25 percent depreciation of the real effective exchange value of the euro.
Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to
the rest of the world, including the United States. U.S. economic activity contracts
sharply, as U.S. corporate bond spreads rise by about 300 basis points, equity prices
plunge, credit availability tightens, and household and business confidence erodes. In
addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar
depress U.S. net exports. In all, because of greater resource slack and lower commodity
and import prices, total U.S. consumer prices fall in 2013, before beginning to rise in
2014 as economic activity starts to recover. U.S. real GDP falls about 1 percent this year
and increases only ½ percent in 2014. The unemployment rate rises to 9¼ percent in
2014 and then gradually declines. With inflationary pressures subdued and the
unemployment rate above its 6½ percent threshold value until late 2018, the federal funds
rate does not lift off from its effective lower bound until 2019.
More Expansionary Monetary Policy in AFEs
y In this scenario, we consider the possibility that monetary policy in the advanced
t
n
i foreign economies (AFEs) becomes considerably more expansive than in the baseline.
a
t
r
e Slow economic growth and, in some countries, undesirably low projected inflation rates
c
n
U could bolster the case for further monetary easing in the AFEs, especially in the United
&
Kingdom, Japan, and the euro area. We assume that the easing policies adopted in each
s
k
s AFE country, which might include asset purchases or longer-term central bank lending,
i
R

reduce term premiums on 10-year government bonds by 50 basis points on average for
the AFEs. We also assume that AFE central banks credibly indicate that they will keep
policy rates unchanged for two quarters longer than in the baseline. These easing
measures lower the real exchange value of AFE currencies by 3 percent in 2013.4 The
combination of easier financial conditions and exchange rate depreciations boosts AFE
economic growth in 2013 and 2014 by ¾ percentage point relative to the baseline and
causes AFE core inflation to run ½ percentage point faster.
The expansion in foreign activity is large enough to offset the effects of a
sustained real dollar appreciation of about 1 percent, leaving the performance of the U.S.
economy little changed.5 With real U.S. net exports rising slightly, U.S. real GDP grows
2¾ percent in 2013 and 3¼ percent in 2014, marginally faster than in the baseline. Core
PCE inflation runs a touch faster as well, averaging somewhat more than 1¾ percent in
2014 and beyond. As in the baseline, the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent in
the third quarter of 2015, and the target for the federal funds rate is not increased until the
fourth quarter of 2015.
4 In line with the LSAP experience for the United States, the AFE central bank operations to
y
expand their balance sheets are assumed to prompt a decline of 2 percent in those countries’ real exchange t
n
rates. The AFE central banks’ indication that they will keep policy rates unchanged for two quarters longer a i
t
leads to a further 1 percent depreciation of their real exchange rates. e r
5 The magnitude of the appreciation of the real U.S. dollar (1 percent) is less than the magnitude of n c
U
the depreciation of the AFE currencies (3 percent) because the U.S. broad real dollar also includes the
&
emerging market economy (EME) currencies, which move little against the dollar. The results for the
s
EMEs are discussed in the “Currency Wars” box in the International Economic Developments and Outlook k
s
section of this Tealbook. Importantly, the AFE policy actions stimulate economic activity in the EMEs. R i
