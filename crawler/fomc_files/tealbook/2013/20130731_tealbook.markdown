Editorial note:
Beginning with this edition of the Tealbook, we are running an experiment in
which we are examining whether we can provide you with the forecast-related
information that you need in a more concise, efficient manner. Specifically, the idea is to
explore whether we should intersperse four traditional-format versions of the Tealbook
(delivered in advance of SEP meetings) with four short-form versions (prepared for non-
SEP meetings). In this first attempt at the short-form document, the sections Domestic
Economic Developments and Outlook and International Economic Developments and
Outlook appear in condensed form.
We are drawn to the possibility that a four-plus-four model for the Tealbook
might better serve your needs based partly on the observation that time generally moves
relatively slowly in the nonfinancial economy. To be sure, from one meeting to the next,
we do routinely revise some aspects of the nonfinancial outlook—both domestic and
foreign; but almost invariably, the general contour of the outlook remains the same.
Accordingly, our goal in the short-form version is to focus mostly on the key factors that
shaped the revisions to the outlook during the intermeeting period and to give relatively
less attention to rehearsing the contour of the forecast—for the most part reserving the
latter discussion for the long-form document.
Even in the abbreviated format, we will continue to use boxes to illuminate
aspects of the forecast that we believe warrant special attention. Indeed, the abbreviated
format should free up staff time that can be devoted, in part, to more such special-topic
analysis. We will also continue to provide a full treatment of risks to the forecast in the
Risks and Uncertainty section.
As part of the process of considering whether to go forward with alternating
forms of the Tealbook, we make two important commitments to the Committee: First,
the underlying forecast preparation process will be the same during all eight rounds; there
will be no stinting on the care with which we sift the incoming data and assess how best
to revise the outlook. The only change would be in the Tealbook itself where we explain
the forecast. Second, we will maintain the capacity to produce a full-length Tealbook
even during a non-SEP round (given some reasonable period of forewarning) if
circumstances warrant.
We will come back to you after the upcoming FOMC meeting for your
observations on and suggestions for this experiment.

Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The data we have received in recent weeks suggest that economic activity rose at D
n
a slower pace over the first half of this year than we projected in the June Tealbook. Our o
c
E
estimate of the average pace of real GDP growth in the first and second quarters now
c
i
t
stands at 1½ percent, ½ percentage point less than in our June forecast. Some of the s
e
m
shortfall in growth relative to our expectations occurred in consumer spending and o
D
residential construction. Our reading of these data suggests that some of the surprise in
these categories is likely to carry forward into the second half of the year; as a result, we
have extrapolated forward a good portion of the miss. However, some of the weaker-
than-expected data during the first half pertained to net exports and inventories; in these
areas, we expect the contributions to growth to rebound during the second half of this
year. On balance, these influences leave our projection for real GDP growth down only a
bit in the second half of the year relative to the June Tealbook, and we continue to show a
substantial step-up in the pace of economic activity in the second half, averaging
2¾ percent over that period, about 0.1 percentage point less than in the June Tealbook. If
not for the resilience of the labor market, we would have marked down the forecast more.
With mixed financial market developments and little change to other key
conditioning assumptions, our projection for GDP growth over the medium term is
essentially unrevised from June. Nevertheless, as a result of the weaker growth this year,
the level of real GDP at the end of 2015 is expected to be ½ percent below what was
envisioned in the June Tealbook.
In contrast to the spending data, the jobs report for June was a little better than we
had expected, with payroll employment coming in above our forecast and the
unemployment rate essentially meeting our expectation. Nevertheless, given the
somewhat weaker level of economic activity in this forecast, the unemployment rate is
projected to cross the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold one quarter later than in the June
Tealbook and to finish 2015 at 6 percent, ¼ percentage point higher than before.
Although inflation has been very low, we continue to think that the soft readings
seen during the first half of the year partly reflected transitory influences. Indeed the
latest readings on core consumer prices have been slightly higher than we were
expecting. With long-run inflation expectations remaining stable, and slack in labor and
product markets gradually diminishing, our baseline forecast calls for core PCE price

inflation is projected to run a little below core inflation over the medium term, as

o
c
E As always, numerous risks attend the outlook. Among these risks at present are
c
t i the uncertain effects of fiscal policy—including not only how the actions taken earlier
s
e
m this year will continue to play out, but also the need this fall to lift the debt ceiling and to
o
D
enact annual appropriations measures. In addition, the rise in mortgage rates could weigh
on the housing sector by more than we are projecting, or activity abroad—including in
China and Europe—could fail to meet our expectations. With regard to our projection for
inflation, the most pressing risk, in our view, is that the recent softness fails to abate as
we anticipate. Moreover, with the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound and
given the uncertain efficacy and costs associated with portfolio policy, monetary policy
has a limited capacity to counteract the effects of any downside developments either with
respect to real activity or inflation.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 We revised up our assumption for the cumulative amount of purchases of long-
term securities under the current LSAP program. We now assume that
purchases will begin to slow later this year and end by the middle of next year,
cumulating to $1.2 trillion (up from our assumption of $750 billion in the June
Tealbook). In addition, we now assume that the Federal Reserve will not sell
any of its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities. As best we can tell,
market participants’ current expectations for asset purchases are roughly in line
with our own.
 With the unemployment rate projected to fall below the Committee’s
6½ percent threshold in the second quarter of 2015, we now assume that the
federal funds rate will begin to rise from its effective lower bound in the third
quarter of 2015—one quarter later than in the June Tealbook.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield has increased about 35 basis points, on net, since
the June Tealbook. We attribute most of that increase to a rise in the term

k
o
o
l
premium and some to market expectations of a higher path for the federal u t
O
funds rate. We assume that the Treasury term premium will gradually
&
converge back to the upward-sloping path we had previously projected, and we e l
v
e
assume that market participants’ expected path for the federal funds rate will D
n
gradually drop back to ours. As a result, the level of the 10-year yield at the o
c
E
end of 2015—3.85 percent—is unchanged from the June Tealbook. (For
c
i
t
further discussion, see the box “Interpretations of Developments in Key s
e
m
Financial Markets.”) o
D
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have moved up about 25 basis
points since the June Tealbook, and we assume that yields on these corporate
bonds will reach 5½ percent at the end of 2015. This path is somewhat higher
through the first half of 2015 than it was in the June Tealbook but is unrevised
at the end of the projection period.
 Conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates have increased about 35 basis
points since the June Tealbook, and we expect these mortgage rates to reach
about 5¼ percent by the end of 2015. This path is also somewhat higher
through the first half of 2015 than it was in the June Tealbook and is unrevised
at the end of the projection period.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Despite the increase in Treasury and other yields, equity prices have increased
4½ percent since the time of the June Tealbook. We project equity prices to
rise at an average annual rate of about 7 percent over the medium term, leaving
them 1½ percent higher at the end of 2015 than in the previous Tealbook.
 With recent readings about in line with our expectations, our projection for
house prices is roughly unchanged. We assume that house prices will increase
at an annual rate of 8½ percent over the second half of 2013 before stepping
down to growth rates of 5 percent in 2014 and 4 percent in 2015.
Fiscal Policy
 We made no revisions to our fiscal policy assumptions. The drag on real GDP
growth from changes in fiscal policy (at all levels of government) is still
assumed to be 1¼ percentage points in 2013 and then to diminish to

Interpretations of Developments in Key Financial Markets
&
l
e
v
e We have been surprised by the significant moves in key financial markets during the past few
D
months. Since the April Tealbook (that is, two Tealbooks ago), the 10‐year Treasury yield has
n
o increased 85 basis points, the 30‐year fixed‐rate mortgage rate and the BBB‐rated corporate bond
c
E yield have moved up a bit more than that, and stock prices have climbed almost 8 percent.
c
i
t
s
e
m In putting together our baseline projection, we have interpreted these financial developments as
o mainly reflecting three factors. First, it appears that reduced risk aversion in equity markets has
D
helped boost stock prices. Second, we think that participants in a variety of asset markets have
interpreted the balance of FOMC communications as pointing to a tighter stance of monetary
policy for any given outlook for the economy. Third, money managers and retail investors have
reportedly come to view a range of fixed‐income securities as offering a less favorable risk–return
tradeoff than they had previously thought. With respect to this third point, we think that FOMC
communications in recent months caused investors to shift away from positions that seemed to be
predicated on the view that interest rates and interest rate volatilities would remain unusually low
long into the future.
Despite the large increase in the 10‐year Treasury yield since the April Tealbook, we have made
essentially no revision to our projection for the level of that yield at the end of the 2015. That is, we
have interpreted the recent increases in the 10‐year Treasury yield as partly reflecting transitory
influences—we expect the market to eventually reverse its recent move toward anticipating an
earlier liftoff of the federal funds rate—and partly as pulling forward increases in the Treasury term
premium that we had expected to occur later in the forecast period. We have similarly flattened
the projected path of equity prices in response to the larger‐than‐expected increase we have seen
in recent months.
Of course, interpreting market moves is fraught with uncertainty, and projecting the evolution of
market beliefs is more difficult still. For example, the recent rise in the 10‐year Treasury term
premium might be part of a continuing trend rather than a one‐time shift. In the “Higher Long‐
Term Interest Rates” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section, we explore the
potential macroeconomic effects of a further rise in long‐term interest rates.
With regard to the stock market, the rise of equity prices in our baseline projection depends
importantly on an assumed gradual decline in the equity risk premium over the medium term. As
noted above, a drop in the equity premium appears to have been an important driver of the recent
stock market rally. However, the equity premium could decline more slowly than we assume or
level off, in which case we would expect a lower path for equity prices. Conversely, the recent
combination of stock price increases and higher bond yields could signal the beginning of a more
marked reversal than we have assumed in our baseline projection of the flight‐to‐safety pressures
that have reduced Treasury yields and limited equity price appreciation since 2009. In that case,
the equity premium at the end of the projection period might be substantially lower, prompting a
stronger rise in the stock market. The macroeconomic effects of this latter interpretation of recent
developments are explored in the alternative scenario “Increased Risk Appetite” in the Risks and
Uncertainty section.

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar e
D
n
 Our outlook for foreign economic growth is revised down just a touch, o
c
E
reflecting disappointing data from emerging market economies and the
c
i
t
expected drag from the recent tightening of financial conditions in foreign s
e
m
economies. We estimate that foreign GDP growth increased at an annual rate o
D
of 2¼ percent in the second quarter; we project foreign GDP growth to pick up
over the medium term, reaching a pace of 3½ percent in 2015.
 Our outlook for the broad real dollar is little changed since the previous
Tealbook. With financial stresses in Europe anticipated to abate and trend
depreciation against the currencies of the emerging market economies expected
to continue, we project the broad real dollar to depreciate at an annual rate of
2½ percent.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has increased moderately since the time of the
June Tealbook, primarily because of tensions in the Middle East. In contrast,
oil price futures at longer-dated maturities were pushed down by concerns
about slower future growth in oil demand. Consistent with these market
developments, the price of imported oil is expected to fall more rapidly over
the medium term, from $104 per barrel in the second half of this year to $89
per barrel by the end of 2015.
 A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices has declined about 1 percent since
the June Tealbook. We expect prices to decrease at an annual rate of
3½ percent in the second half of 2013 and to flatten out thereafter.

u t RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
O
&
Incoming data have led us to revise down our estimate of real GDP growth in the
l
e
e v first half of the year by ½ percentage point to an annual rate of 1½ percent.1 Nonetheless,
D
n we continue to project that real GDP growth will pick up substantially in the second half
o
c
E of the year as the drag from fiscal policy wanes and consumer spending is boosted by
c
t i recent gains in wealth and improved sentiment.
s
e
m
o
D  Since the June Tealbook, we have received disappointing news on consumer
outlays and residential investment; in response, we have tamped our projection
for spending in these categories in the second half of the year. We also
received negative readings on net exports and inventory investment, but we
expect the contributions of these categories to rebound in the second half.
 The growth rate of real PCE during the first half of the year fell short of our
expectation—2 percent at an annual rate versus our forecast of 2½ percent. We
have interpreted the more modest first-half spending growth as reflecting both
a slightly faster adjustment by consumers to the tax increases put in place at the
beginning of the year and a lower underlying pace of consumer spending. On
balance, the downward revision to our forecast for PCE growth in 2013:H2 is
about half as large as the downward revision to our estimate over 2013:H1.
 We have revised down our projection for the growth rate of residential
investment in the second half of 2013 based partly on the two most recent
readings on single-family housing starts, which have been on the soft side of
our expectations. Nonetheless, we continue to see housing construction
activity as trending up, as suggested by the steadier numbers on building
permits.
o We do not think the increase in mortgage rates since May was
responsible for the disappointing June starts figures. That said, we do
expect the higher level of mortgage rates in this projection to have a

GDP growth in 2013:Q2, along with revised figures for earlier periods. Importantly, this revision will
expand the concept of investment to include expenditures on a wider array of intellectual property products.
We have not attempted to take this new concept into account in our current forecast of GDP.

modest restraining effect on the growth of residential investment over u t
O
the second half.
&
l
e
v
 While we were also surprised on the downside by the incoming data on net e
D
exports and inventory investment, for these categories we have interpreted the n
o
c
negative first-half news as pointing toward a more positive contribution to E
c
GDP growth (up ¼ percentage point) in the second half. t i
s
e
m
o
 The recent data have included some upbeat news on economic activity. The D
level of nonfarm payroll employment in June stands about 100,000 above our
projection in the previous Tealbook. Motor vehicle sales moved up to an
annual rate of 15.9 million units in June—their highest reading since 2007—
and sales in July appear to be running at nearly this pace. New orders of
nondefense capital goods have increased noticeably over the past three months.
In addition, factory output moved up in May and June after declining in the
prior two months, and readings from the national and regional manufacturing
surveys have improved, on balance, recently.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
Over the medium term, our forecast for GDP growth is little revised from the June
Tealbook. We now expect real GDP to rise 3¼ percent pace in 2014 and 3½ percent
in 2015.
 The higher trajectory for interest rates in the current projection is a modest
restraint on consumer and business spending, which is offset by the upward
revision to our assumed path for equity prices. The effects of other changes to
our key assumptions are also small and offsetting.
 With no changes to our supply-side assumptions this round, the GDP gap is
½ percentage point wider than in our previous projection, largely due to the
downward revisions to growth this year.

u t THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
O
&
Despite the negative surprise to GDP growth during the first half of this year, the
l
e
v
e labor market appears to have firmed a bit more than we had anticipated in the June
D
n Tealbook.
o
c
E
c  In the payroll survey, employers in the nonfarm sector are now reported to
i
t
s
e have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month in the second quarter, about
m
o
D 30,000 more per month than in our last projection and similar to the pace seen
since late last year.
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate remained at 7.6 percent in
June, a few basis points above our previous forecast, leaving the second quarter
average at 7.5 percent, unrevised from our June Tealbook forecast.
 The staff’s Labor Market Conditions Index, which summarizes the movements
of 19 labor market indicators, rose further in June.
 We project payroll gains of 180,000 per month in the second half of the year
(15,000 more per month than in the previous projection), and we forecast the
unemployment rate to edge down to 7.4 percent by 2013:Q4 (revised up
0.1 percentage point).
Over the medium term, the labor market is anticipated to gradually improve in
line with the overall pace of economic activity.
 With a somewhat wider output gap, the unemployment rate is projected to fall
more gradually than in the June Tealbook. The rate is projected to reach
7 percent by the middle of 2014 and to fall below the Committee’s threshold of
6½ percent in the second quarter of 2015. By the end of 2015, we now have
the rate at 6 percent, ¼ percentage point higher than in the previous forecast.
 We expect total payroll gains to average 200,000 per month in 2014 and then
to step up to a monthly pace of 250,000 in 2015, a bit lower than in the June
Tealbook.
 For a discussion of some of the implications of the Affordable Care Act, see

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION u t
O
&
Our forecast for inflation is little changed from the June Tealbook.
l
e
v
e
D
 We estimate that the overall PCE price index rose at an annual rate of
n
o
½ percent in the first half of this year, held down by sharp declines in energy c
E
prices and unusually low core inflation. We continue to think that the recent c
i
t
s
low readings on core PCE prices reflect, in part, transitory influences from e
m
o
nonmarket and medical prices (see the box “What Is behind the Surprisingly D
Low Rate of Inflation?”).
 Since the June Tealbook, the data on core consumer prices have been just a
little higher than we expected, leaving our projection for core inflation in the
second half of the year a touch higher at 1½ percent.
 Incoming data on consumer energy prices have been slightly higher than
expected, and the recent increase in crude oil prices suggests that consumer
energy prices will move up noticeably in the third quarter. Thereafter, energy
prices are projected to decline, reflecting the downward tilt in the path of
futures prices for crude oil.
 With core PCE inflation anticipated to edge up over the medium term in
response to rising resource utilization, total PCE inflation is projected to run at
about 1¼ percent in 2014 and 1½ percent in 2015. Thus, throughout the
medium term, the PCE inflation projection remains below both the
Committee’s long-run objective of 2 percent and the threshold level of
2½ percent.

Potential Effects of the ACA on Labor Markets
&
l
e
v
e As has been discussed widely in the media, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains several
D
provisions that could affect the labor market. Our analysis—supplemented by a set of
n
o special questions that the Reserve Banks posed to their Beige Book contacts in late June and
c
E early July—suggests that the ACA is likely to have only small labor market effects, a
c
i conclusion also reached by the Congressional Budget Office and other outside analysts.
t
s
e Thus, the Obama Administration’s recent decision to delay the employer requirement to
m
o provide health insurance to employees by one year does not materially affect our labor
D
market outlook.1
The most relevant provisions of the ACA for the labor market are the employer and
individual mandates and the expansion of health insurance subsidies. The employer
mandate requires firms with 50 or more full‐time equivalent (FTE) workers (where “full‐
time” is defined as 30 hours or more per week) to offer qualifying health insurance to their
full‐time employees or else pay an annual penalty of $2,000 per full‐time worker; there is no
requirement or penalty for part‐time workers. Firms who do offer insurance but whose
insurance is deemed “unaffordable” face annual penalties of $3,000 for each full‐time
worker who turns down that insurance and enrolls in subsidized health insurance through
the new exchanges. These subsidies are quite generous but are only available to individuals
without access to affordable employer‐provided insurance.2
The ACA is unlikely to have sizable labor market effects because—as shown on the table on
the next page—almost all of the firms subject to the employer mandate already offer health
insurance to their employees. For example, 94 percent of firms with 50 to 200 employees
offer health insurance (and the fraction offering health insurance is even higher for larger
firms), and 90 percent of employees work for firms that offer health insurance. To be sure,
the ACA may still raise costs somewhat for firms already offering insurance, as some of them
may have to make their health insurance more comprehensive, more affordable, or offer it
to a larger share of their employees (although most of the workers who are currently
ineligible for insurance are part‐time workers who would not have to be covered under the
ACA, a small share of them are full‐time workers who would have to be covered). In
addition, the share of eligible employees who accept insurance (the take‐up rate) may
increase somewhat as a result of the individual mandate. For most firms, however, the
increase in labor costs is likely to be small.
The ACA could, in principle, lead to an increase in the share of part‐time workers in the
economy. The exclusion of part‐time employees from the employer mandate, combined
with the generosity of the exchange subsidies (which are available only to those without
access to affordable employer‐provided health insurance), gives some firms the incentive to
shift from full‐time to part‐time workers to avoid penalties and gives some low‐income
1
The employer mandate has been delayed until 2015, but other elements of the ACA will continue to be
implemented as originally scheduled on January 1, 2014.
2 For families with income below 400 percent of the poverty level, the subsidies limit premium costs to
a share of income that ranges between 2 and 9.5 percent (with the limits increasing with income).

l
workers the incentive to switch from full‐time to part‐time work (possibly taking multiple e
v
e
part‐time jobs) to gain access to the exchange subsidies. However, any such shifts are likely D
to occur only gradually and would largely affect the composition of the workforce—there n
o
would be more part‐time workers but also more part‐time jobs—and, given that the c
E
magnitude of these shifts is likely to be small, we do not see a reason for aggregate work c
i
hours to be affected significantly.3 Accordingly, we have not built any material effect of the s t
e
ACA (and its partially delayed implementation) into the staff’s labor market forecast. m
o
D
The responses to our Beige Book questions also suggest that the labor market effects of the
ACA likely will be small. Only a relatively small share of firms reported that they plan to do
one or more of the following: make more use of part‐time workers (9 percent), outsource
more work (9 percent), and refrain from hiring to keep under the 50 FTE threshold
(6 percent). Similarly, a relatively small share of firms reported that they are planning to
make changes to their health insurance, including one or more of: making their insurance
more comprehensive (11 percent), offering it to more employees (6 percent), and cutting
back or dropping coverage (5 percent). In their comments, many firms expressed concerns
about the ACA’s administrative costs as well as the possibility that the ACA would eventually
drive up the costs of health insurance. A sizable number of firms said they are likely to raise
prices, reduce other employee benefits, or both, to defray some of the higher costs. Finally,
many firms reported that they were still quite uncertain about the effects of the ACA on
both their own bottom line and that of their customers.

3 The ACA also could affect labor force participation. The generosity of the exchange subsidies may
allow some of those who work only to get affordable health insurance to exit the labor force (for example,

enter the labor force (like low‐income or disabled individuals who currently stay out of the labor force in
order to maintain eligibility for public health insurance programs).

What Is behind the Surprisingly Low Rate of Inflation?
&
l
e
v
e Readings on PCE inflation have been quite low recently. Over the 12 months ending in
D
June, headline PCE prices are estimated to have risen about 1¼ percent, while core PCE
n
o prices are estimated to have risen only about 1 percent. As can be seen in the lower‐left
c
E figure, many different measures of underlying inflation have moved down over the past
c
i year; however, the decline in core PCE inflation has been especially noticeable. In
t
s
e evaluating how transitory we should expect the recent low PCE inflation to be, we find it
m
o instructive to compare recent inflation performance with our earlier expectations.
D
Following the low readings on core PCE inflation over the second half of 2012, we
projected in January that core inflation would pick up in the first half of this year.
However, as shown in the table on the next page, both total and core PCE inflation have
come in lower than we projected. Nevertheless, we have not changed our view that
inflation will eventually and gradually move back up toward the Committee’s 2 percent
goal, as we see this year’s lower‐than‐expected readings on headline and core inflation as
being largely attributable to a few factors that we expect to be transitory.
First, the nonmarket component of PCE prices was much softer in the first quarter than
we expected in January. This component is erratic and susceptible to significant
revisions, and, as a result, we take very little forecasting signal from recent readings.1
Indeed, with the most recent data, nonmarket prices now look to have increased in the
second quarter by about as much as we had projected in the January Tealbook;
nevertheless, the average rate of increase over the first half is still below our January
projection.
1
In its upcoming comprehensive revisions, the BEA will bring in new data that could result in
historical revisions to nonmarket prices. In addition, the BEA will adjust the methodology used to
compute imputed financial services charges—an important component of nonmarket prices.

Market-based core PCE inflation rebounded in the first quarter by a bit more than we had
expected but was subsequently held down by two factors that we had not anticipated.
First, as shown in the lower-right figure on the previous page, a one-time decrease in
Medicare reimbursements (related to the federal spending sequestration) temporarily
led the PCE measure of medical services prices to drop sharply in April. In May and June,
these prices appear to have returned to a more normal rate of increase. Second, prices
of core imports, which we estimate to pass through fairly quickly into consumer goods
prices, have been much softer over the first half of the year than we anticipated in
January.
Finally, consumer energy prices, which are of course volatile, declined more rapidly over
the first half than we projected. In all, headline PCE prices edged up at an annual rate of
only ½ percent in the first half—well below what we projected in January.
As noted, the very soft readings on medical prices are probably already behind us, and
nonmarket prices, while quite uncertain, also appear to be rising at a more typical rate. In
the second half of this year, consumer energy prices are projected to edge up on net; we
also expect core import prices to flatten out after having declined in the second quarter,
although if this occurred, it would still leave them much softer than we had anticipated in
.2
January Thus, as these specific influences holding down inflation in the first half recede,
we project headline and core inflation to rise from their recent low rates to a pace of just
under 1½ percent in the second half—a pace we think is more reflective of underlying
6
conditions than are the especially low rates observed over the past or 12 months.

Our projection of core import prices depends importantly on the staff's assumed paths for
exchange rates and commodity prices, around which there is considerable uncertainty.

u t THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
O
&
l  After the unemployment threshold is crossed, the federal funds rate is set
e
v
e according to the prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, assuming that
D
n monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer
o
c
E term. The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
c
t i pressure on longer-term interest rates, and the process of returning the SOMA
s
e
m portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by 2021.
o
D
 Further increases in household and business confidence, diminishing
uncertainty, and further improvements in credit availability support real GDP
growth of 3 percent in 2016. Thereafter, the pace of gains in real GDP
gradually moves down toward the longer-run growth rate of potential output of
2¼ percent, with the unemployment rate reaching its natural rate of 5¼ percent
in late 2017.
 Long-run inflation expectations are assumed to remain well anchored, and,
with the margin of slack in labor and product markets diminishing, consumer
price inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2017. The nominal federal funds rate
is projected to eventually stabilize at around 4 percent later in the decade.

Note: In September 2012, judgmental projections were prepared through 2015 for the Summary of Economic Projections variables, including the
unemployment rate, while projections for other variables, including the labor force participation rate and payroll employment, were prepared only
through 2014. This exhibit therefore reports a 2015 projection from the September 2012 Tealbook only for the unemployment rate.

1. The figures for August 2012 refer to data as originally published in the September employment situation release along
with the staff’s real-time translation of those data into hours worked. These were the latest available data at the time of
the September FOMC meeting.
2. Calculated as the mean of the 2014:Q2 and 2014:Q3 projections.
3. Projections of payrolls and hours worked include the effects of the benchmark revision to the payroll survey.
4. Total hours worked are aggregate hours in the nonfarm business sector. Because that series is available only on a
quarterly basis, the August 2012 figures refer to the quarterly percent change and level in 2012:Q3. The percent changes
and levels in hours are at annual rates.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Real activity in the foreign economies continues to be subdued. After a very
weak first quarter, we estimate that total foreign GDP growth edged up to a still-anemic
2¼ percent in the second quarter. This outcome was in line with our forecast in the June
Tealbook, as moderately better news in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) was
offset by less promising developments in the emerging market economies (EMEs).
Output in the euro area appears to have finally bottomed out after six consecutive
quarters of contraction, and growth in Japan likely put in another strong performance. In
k
o
contrast, Chinese GDP growth remained at its moderate first-quarter pace, and indicators o
l
t
u
for other EMEs point to growth that continues to be well below trend. O
&
l
Going forward, we anticipate that total foreign GDP growth will rise from e
v
e
2¾ percent this quarter to 3½ percent in 2015. This recovery is supported by continued D
n
accommodative monetary policy, lessening drag from fiscal consolidation, some further o
c
E
reduction in financial stresses in Europe, and firming growth in the United States. l
’
t
n
I
Our forecast is only a touch weaker than in the June Tealbook. Part of this
revision reflects our extrapolation of some of the recent weakness in EME data. In
addition, we built in a slight drag from the tightening of financial conditions in recent
months. In particular, long-term interest rates have increased abroad, especially in the
EMEs. (See the box “Assessing Recent Developments in EME Asset Markets” in the
Financial Developments section.) However, in many countries we expect the negative
effects of higher financing costs on growth to be somewhat offset by the positive effects
of depreciated exchange rates.
Our projection of a modest recovery in foreign growth continues to face important
risks. Market reaction to the eventual normalization of advanced economy monetary
policy could result in much greater financial dislocations and spillovers to global activity
than the limited effects we currently assume. In addition, the ongoing slowdown in the
EMEs, particularly in China, could prove sharper and more deep-seated—a possibility we
explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section. And, as has been the case for some time,
the situation in Europe could deteriorate, pushing that region back into recession and
possibly destabilizing global financial markets.

With output growth subdued, our outlook has inflation in the AFEs edging up
from 1¼ percent in the current quarter to only 1½ percent in 2015 (excluding the effects
of the Japanese consumption tax hikes). EME inflation also remains generally contained
over the forecast period. In the near term, we revised inflation in both regions up a little
because of the recent jump in oil prices and depreciation of foreign currencies.
In this low-inflation environment, monetary policy in the AFEs is set to remain
accommodative. Indeed, the European Central Bank (ECB) issued forward guidance
indicating that its rates would remain low for an “extended period,” and the Bank of
England (BOE) stated that market expectations of early tightening were not justified by
k
o
economic developments. In contrast, EME central banks have refrained from a further
o
l
t
u loosening of monetary policy in the face of capital outflows and depreciation pressures,
O
& and some countries have tightened policy, intervened in foreign exchange markets, or
l
e reversed previous measures that restricted capital inflows.

t • China. The release of second-quarter real GDP data and historical revisions
I
have led to a smoother path for Chinese GDP over the past year, with growth
stepping down from a roughly 8 percent pace in the second half of last year to
a subtrend 7 percent pace in the first half of this year. Going forward, we
expect growth to recover to almost 8 percent by early next year, supported by
improving demand in the advanced economies. Thereafter, output growth
slows slightly, in line with the downward trend in potential output growth.
We lowered our outlook for Chinese growth almost ¼ percentage point over
the forecast period, reflecting both the more subdued tone of the incoming
data and our view that Chinese authorities will accept more moderate growth
as they work to rebalance the economy toward consumption and reduce the
risks of financial instability. Indeed, the authorities have taken further steps
recently to curb credit growth, including an apparent crackdown by the
People’s Bank of China on risky balance sheet practices of financial
institutions (see the box “Recent Developments in China’s Interbank
Market”).

• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that GDP growth in the rest of emerging
Asia stepped up to a still-subdued 3 percent annual pace in the second quarter
from 1½ percent in the first. This acceleration primarily reflects a return to
positive growth in the economies of Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand, all of
which had unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter amid weak demand
from the advanced economies and China. GDP growth in the region should
rise to 4½ percent by 2015 as external demand picks up. However, we
marked down growth ¼ percentage point in the second half of this year and
next year, because of weaker data, spillovers from China, and the recent
tightening of financial conditions.

t

• Latin America. We estimate GDP growth in Mexico held steady at O
&
1¾ percent in the second quarter, well below its trend rate. This pace is about
l
e
½ percentage point below our previous Tealbook forecast, as industrial v
e
D
production fell, on balance, through May and consumer confidence dropped
n
o
sharply. Going forward, we call for Mexican growth to pick up to 3¾ percent c
E
by 2014 and to stay at that rate in 2015, a little less than projected in June, ’ l
t
n
I
owing to a downward revision to the outlook for U.S. manufacturing activity.
We estimate that GDP in Brazil rose 2½ percent in the second quarter,
¼ percentage point below that projected in the June Tealbook. This revision
reflects not only weaker-than-expected data, but also increased political
tension following a recent wave of street protests that have shaken business
confidence and amplified the financial stresses already hitting Brazil.
Moreover, the inflationary pressures resulting from the substantial recent
currency depreciation and the desire to damp capital outflows prompted the
central bank of Brazil to further tighten monetary policy. These factors have
led us to revise down GDP growth for the second half of this year and 2014 by
¼ percentage point. However, we expect growth to pick up from its
below-trend pace, rising to about 3¾ percent in 2015, supported by recovery
in the advanced economies and the boost to exports that should result from the
recent decline of the real.

Recent Developments in China’s Interbank Market
In June, interbank interest rates surged to record highs in China. The overnight
Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) moved up from around 4 percent at
the end of May to a peak of 13 percent on June 20 (see left‐hand figure on the
next page). SHIBOR remained elevated for several days until the People’s Bank
of China (PBOC) issued a statement on June 25 that it had injected liquidity and
was committed to stabilizing money markets. Subsequently, SHIBOR gradually
moved lower and is currently close to typical levels. Interbank repo rates have
moved in a similar fashion.
k
o China’s interbank market has grown significantly over the past few years, and
o
l brief liquidity squeezes driven by seasonal or temporary factors have occurred
t
u
O periodically. Indeed, part of the recent rate increase can be attributed to such
& factors, including high demand for cash ahead of the Dragon Boat festival
e l holiday.
v
e
D
What makes the recent episode unusual was the magnitude of the jump in
n
o interest rates and its duration, which is generally believed to at least partially
c
E
reflect a conscious decision by the PBOC to limit its response. In the past, the
l
’
n t PBOC had always injected liquidity when there was upward pressure on money
I
market rates, and, as a consequence, the SHIBOR rate had never reached double‐
digit levels. But in this most recent episode, the PBOC appears to have delayed
its usual response to the surge in rates, likely in order to signal that it is serious
about encouraging better liquidity management, promoting sounder banking
practices more generally, and restraining excessive credit growth—including, as
will be discussed below, in the “shadow banking” sector.
As shown in the right‐hand figure on the next page, total credit to China’s
nonfinancial private sector ballooned from 120 percent of GDP in 2008 to about
175 percent of GDP in 2012, with much of the growth occurring through lending
channels that are less regulated than traditional, deposit‐funded bank credit.
Such shadow banking includes lending via trust companies, corporate bond
issuance by financing intermediaries, off‐balance‐sheet bank loans, and curbside
lending. This lending is often funded by wealth management products (WMPs),
which are typically off‐balance‐sheet instruments offering investors higher
returns than are permitted on bank deposits. Estimates of the total size of the
shadow banking sector vary widely, but, based on the Bank for International
Settlements data on nonbank credit shown in the figure, it has reached about
35 percent of annual GDP.
WMPs typically have relatively short maturities but are used to fund illiquid
longer‐term assets. When large amounts of WMPs are due, as at the end of the
Page 36 of 94

--- Page 40 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 24, 2013
second quarter, this situation can create temporary demand for liquidity.1 In
addition, recent efforts by authorities to restrain the issuance of new WMPs may
have further exacerbated some banks’ funding needs. By refusing to inject
liquidity immediately into the interbank market when rates soared, Chinese
authorities likely hoped to provide stronger incentives for banks to better
manage their liquidity risk. This shot across the bow could also encourage more
prudent credit decisions.
Given its short‐lived nature, the interbank liquidity squeeze should not, by itself,
significantly weigh on the Chinese economy going forward. However, the
episode highlights some of the risks to economic activity and financial stability
posed by rapid and poorly regulated credit growth, including channeling credit
k
toward unproductive projects, promoting underutilized infrastructure and o
o
l
overcapacity in some manufacturing sectors, spurring excessive development t
u
O
and inflated prices in the real estate sector, and undermining the strength and
&
resiliency of domestic financial institutions.
l
e
v
e
At present, we do not believe that a major eruption of financial difficulties is the D
most likely outcome. First, Chinese authorities appear to be taking serious steps n
o
to rein in the shadow banking sector before problems become unmanageable. c
E
Second, the government has ample resources to shore up the banking sector, l
’
t
n
should that become necessary. Moreover, China’s still‐rapid pace of economic
I
growth should, over the longer term, generate the demand needed to absorb
much of the expansion of capacity financed by the credit boom. But in an
environment of mounting indebtedness combined with slowing economic
growth, the risks of severe financial problems and a more abrupt and prolonged
slowing of economic activity certainly exist, and we will continue to monitor the
situation closely.

1 The temporary demand for liquidity is likely exacerbated by the relative inefficiency with
which the interbank market in China recycles funds, so that institutions with ample funds may
not lend them to institutions having difficulty financing WMP withdrawals.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Euro area. We now estimate that the euro area economy finally bottomed out
in the second quarter. This estimate is a touch better than projected in the
June Tealbook, reflecting stronger industrial production, a modest increase in
retail sales, and rising consumer confidence. Despite the second-quarter
improvement, we tempered the strength of the recovery a bit in response to
slightly tighter financial conditions, partly reflecting political tensions in some
peripheral countries. All told, we continue to expect a sluggish recovery,
with GDP growth of less than ½ percent in the second half, 1 percent in 2014,
k
o and just 2 percent in 2015, as financial stresses abate and the drag from fiscal
o
l
t
u consolidation lessens.
O
&
l
e At its July meeting, in response to the increase in long-term yields over the
v
e
D previous several weeks, the ECB stated that it “expects the key ECB interest
n
o rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.”1 In
c
E
line with this guidance, we expect the ECB to keep rates on hold until late
l
’
t
n
I 2015.
• United Kingdom. Surprisingly strong activity in the services sector led us to
revise up our estimate of second-quarter U.K. GDP growth by almost
1½ percentage points to 2½ percent. This greater momentum should help
keep growth at about 2 percent over the rest of the year, somewhat faster than
previously expected. Growth should then move back up to 2½ percent in
2015, supported by continued accommodative monetary policy, diminished
fiscal drag, and euro-area recovery. We do not expect the BOE to expand its
asset purchase program further, but instead to provide forward guidance to
reinforce its accommodative stance, possibly making use of thresholds in its
communications.
• Japan. Recent indicators have been better than we had expected: Industrial
production soared in May, and the Tankan survey showed a broad-based

improvement in corporate sentiment. We now estimate that GDP rose at a
3¾ percent pace in the second quarter, ½ percentage point faster than in the
June Tealbook forecast, and we expect it to expand at a solid 3 percent rate in
the second half of the year. However, we continue to expect growth to slow
markedly to an average pace of 1 percent in 2014 and 2015 despite aggressive
easing on the part of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), largely owing to fiscal
consolidation efforts. Data through May point to a ½ percent increase in
consumer prices in the second quarter, a bit more than we had expected in
June. With the BOJ maintaining its asset purchase program through the end
of 2015, inflation (excluding the effects of consumption tax hikes) should rise
k
o
to 1¼ percent by the end of the forecast period. o

expect growth to rebound in the current quarter and to average about o

held consumer prices flat in the second quarter, but we expect inflation to I

the end of 2015.

Financial Developments
Financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period, with interest rates
and stock prices moving up on net. Investors reportedly read the balance of Federal
Reserve communications as suggesting a less accommodative stance for policy going
forward than they had previously anticipated. Market participants’ perception of a tighter
policy outlook was reinforced by incoming economic data—particularly the June
employment report—that were seen as pointing to further improvement in labor market
conditions. All told, longer-term interest rates moved up appreciably, on net, over the
period. Despite the rise in rates, equity prices also moved higher, evidently buoyed by
investors’ more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook. Price movements in a
number of fixed-income markets were reportedly amplified over the period by an
unwinding of carry trades and related deleveraging and other technical factors.
On balance, yields on intermediate- and longer-term Treasury securities rose
21 to 34 basis points, with staff models attributing most of the increases to a rise in term
premiums and the remainder to an upward revision in the expected path of short-term
rates. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved up modestly. Yields on
speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed, leaving their risk spreads
s
narrower. In contrast, yields on agency MBS advanced slightly more than those on t
n
e
Treasury securities with comparable duration. In the advanced foreign economies, m
p
increases in sovereign yields were smaller than those on Treasury securities, reflecting in o
l
e
v
part forward guidance and other statements by the ECB and the Bank of England that e
D
were read as affirming their accommodative policies. On net over the period, the dollar l
a
i
c
generally appreciated against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies and was n
a
n
little changed against emerging market currencies. i
F
Financing flows to businesses and households were mixed. Issuance of
syndicated loans, which carry floating rates, remained sizable, although bond issuance by
nonfinancial corporations declined markedly in June, as the higher interest rates made
refinancing less attractive. Similarly, the pace of mortgage purchase applications held
about steady, while the volume of refinancing applications fell sharply over the
intermeeting period as home mortgage rates rose. Consumer credit continued to expand
in May at a solid pace. Core bank loans to households and businesses continued to grow
modestly in the second quarter. In the July 2013 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on

Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), moderate net fractions of banks generally reported a
further easing of lending policies and an increase in demand across most loan categories
in the second quarter. Bond mutual funds experienced substantial redemptions in June
and some continued outflows in July, with part of the proceeds reportedly being
reallocated into M2, which accelerated over these two months.
TREASURY YIELDS, POLICY EXPECTATIONS, AND AGENCY MBS YIELDS
Longer-term Treasury yields rose significantly, on net, over the intermeeting
period.1 The largest increases occurred following the release of the June FOMC
statement, the results of the Summary of Economic Projections, and the Chairman’s
accompanying press conference, all of which were seen as suggesting a less
accommodative stance of monetary policy going forward and appeared to contribute to
increased uncertainty about the level of interest rates. The better-than-anticipated June
employment report also contributed to the rise in longer-term yields. Large portions of
the rate increases early in the period were subsequently retraced following additional
communications that were read as reaffirming the Federal Reserve’s commitment to a
highly accommodative policy stance for the foreseeable future. Overall, uncertainty
about future short- and long-term interest rates remained elevated compared with their
levels recorded around the time of the May FOMC meeting.
s
t
Five-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury yields rose 26 basis points, 34 basis points, and n
e
m
21 basis points, respectively, over the period. Increases in intermediate-horizon forward p
o
rates were notably larger than those in longer-horizon forward rates, consistent with an e l
v
e
outlook for more-rapid increases in the federal funds rate after liftoff. Market D
l
participants noted that many market forces may have contributed to the magnitude and a
i
c
n
speed of price moves, as investors apparently continued to pull back from strategies a
n
i
predicated on an environment of low rates and low volatility. These forces included an F
unwinding of carry trades, outflows from long-duration bond funds, MBS convexity-
hedging flows, and diminished liquidity in some markets. The diminished liquidity
reportedly reflected in part a reduction in the willingness of dealers to purchase positions
from clients with the expectation of subsequently working these into the relevant market.
Staff term structure models suggest that a rise in term premiums accounts for about
two-thirds of the increase in the 10-year Treasury yield, consistent with higher interest

rate uncertainty, perhaps some modest downward revisions to LSAP expectations, and
the effects of the pronounced market dynamics just described.
The federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of financial market quotes
steepened significantly early in the period and then mostly retraced, largely in response to
policymakers’ communications.2 On net, the expected policy rate path implied by
overnight index swaps at the end of 2016 was up 22 basis points. However, this standard
measure does not incorporate an adjustment for term premiums. A staff term structure
model that accounts for the zero lower bound on nominal yields attributes about half of
the increase in the overnight index swap curve to higher term premiums, implying only a
modest rise in the expected path of the federal funds rate. Heightened policy rate
uncertainty likely contributed to the rise in term premiums.
The results from the Open Market Desk’s July Survey of Primary Dealers showed
little change in the projected liftoff date for the federal funds rate relative to the June
survey.3 The median expectation of the most likely time of the first increase in the target
federal funds rate remained in the third quarter of 2015, at which point the unemployment
rate is projected to be 6.3 percent according to the median dealer, lower than the
6.5 percent threshold announced in the December FOMC statement. The projected
federal funds rate path was little changed, perhaps pointing to a small increase in the pace
s of tightening after the first funds rate increase. The median estimate of the aggregate size
t
n
m e of the current asset purchase program was lowered slightly relative to the June survey.4
p
o In a special question, dealers were asked to rate the importance of a range of factors that
l
e

financial market quotes. Dealers rated “higher uncertainty around path of policy rates”

2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging about 6 basis points.
3 Following the June FOMC meeting, primary dealers were asked to update their expectation for
the timing of the first federal funds target rate increase. Their median expectation for liftoff moved in one
quarter relative to the June survey; however, in the current survey, the median shifted back to about the
same date as reported in the June survey.
4 Following the June FOMC meeting, primary dealers were asked to update their expectation for
asset purchases. Their median expectation for the aggregate size of the current purchase program declined
slightly relative to the June survey and remained about unchanged in the current survey.

changes in the FOMC’s view of the appropriate path of policy rates as contributing to the
revision in policy expectations over the period.
Measures of inflation compensation derived from TIPS increased modestly, on
net, reversing declines posted early in the period that likely reflected, at least in part,
reduced liquidity in the market. Inflation compensation derived from inflation swaps was
similarly somewhat higher on balance. Consistent with these developments, the risk-
neutral distribution of inflation calculated from inflation caps shifted slightly to the right
at both the 5- and 10-year horizons. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations remained in recent ranges.
Yields on agency MBS rose slightly more than those on Treasury securities with
comparable duration over the intermeeting period. The option-adjusted spread for
production-coupon MBS widened by 11 basis points, possibly reflecting a downward
revision in the market’s expectation for Federal Reserve MBS purchases, an increase in
uncertainty about longer-term interest rates, and convexity-related MBS selling. On net,
30-year conforming mortgage rates rose about in line with MBS yields and ended the
period about 40 basis points higher at 4¼ percent.
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING
s
Since the June FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department auctioned $200 billion n t
e
m
in nominal securities and $22 billion in TIPS. Bid-to-cover ratios were generally below
p
o
historical average levels. The Treasury continued to operate under a “debt issuance l
e
v
suspension period” declared by Treasury Secretary Lew on May 19, which allows the e
D
Treasury to use accounting measures to remain under the debt limit while issuing new a l
i
c
securities.5 Staff projections suggest that these measures should allow federal debt to n
a
n
stay below the statutory debt ceiling at least until late September. i
F
The Desk conducted outright purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS as
planned.6 While the purchases did not seem to have material adverse effects on the

Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund, redeeming existing investments
and suspending new investment in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, and suspending the
daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund into Treasury securities.
6 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $46 billion in Treasury securities under the
flow-based Treasury purchase program. In addition, the Desk purchased $79 billion in agency MBS under
the flow-based MBS program and the reinvestment program.

functioning of either the Treasury or MBS markets, liquidity in these markets,
particularly in agency MBS, reportedly deteriorated somewhat during the intermeeting
period amid heightened volatility—especially in the days following the June FOMC
meeting. Bid–asked spreads for some Treasury securities edged up a bit initially but then
retraced, while average MBS trade sizes declined somewhat throughout the period. The
offer-to-cover ratio on Desk purchases of Treasury securities at longer maturities
remained somewhat below its average recorded since the beginning of the year, and the
spread between the executed and the second-most-favorable price offered in MBS
operations—a measure of liquidity—widened. That said, fails-to-deliver in both the
Treasury and MBS markets generally remained relatively low, and dollar-roll-implied
financing rates for 30-year Fannie Mae 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent coupon securities
suggested little settlement pressure in the TBA market for these securities. In light of the
latter, the Desk’s dollar roll activity in the June and July settlement cycles diminished
somewhat compared with earlier in the year.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Despite the volatility in longer-term fixed-income markets, conditions in short-
term dollar funding markets remained fairly benign throughout the intermeeting period.
The spread between three-month LIBOR and comparable-maturity OIS rates and the
spread between the three-month forward rate agreement three months ahead and the

financial issuers increased somewhat but stayed at the low end of the range seen over the
past several years, while the amount outstanding edged down. Consistent with the trends

in the unsecured CP market, outstanding asset-backed commercial paper for programs
with both U.S. and European sponsors decreased, on net, while rates were little changed.
Stock prices of large domestic banks followed the broad trend in the S&P 500,
declining a bit after the June FOMC meeting but later reversing, and ended the period
about 7 percent higher. In contrast, equity prices of agency mortgage REITs continued
their recent declines. Following trends in broad credit indexes, CDS spreads for the
largest bank holding companies edged down, on net, and they remained near the bottom
of their ranges over the past five years.
All of the largest banks reported second-quarter earnings that were above
analysts’ expectations. Higher-than-expected earnings were driven primarily by
increased revenues in investment banking activities and asset management operations,
cost-reduction efforts, and improving loan performance that allowed for further
reductions in loss provisions. Net interest margins remained flat to slightly down at most
banks. Meanwhile, some of the largest U.S. banking institutions stepped up dividend
payouts and share repurchases.
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Despite the rise in longer-term interest rates, broad U.S. equity price indexes rose
s
3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by an upward revision n t
e
m
in market participants’ outlook for the economy. The staff’s estimate of the spread
p
o
between the expected real equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 10-year l
e
v
Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity premium—narrowed further. Although the e
D
estimated level of the equity premium remains above its historical norm, it has receded a l
i
c
substantially—by nearly 200 basis points—since the turn of the year. The VIX, an n
a
n
options-based index of volatility on one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, increased i
F
notably early in the intermeeting period but subsequently fell back to its lowest level in
several months.
To date, a little less than one-half of the nonfinancial firms in the S&P 500 have
posted earnings results for the second quarter. Those reports, together with Wall Street
analyst forecasts for firms that have yet to report, suggest that aggregate earnings per
share were about flat relative to the level seen four quarters earlier. Many firms
attributed weakness in profit growth to sluggish economic conditions abroad and the
relative strength of the U.S. dollar, as those conditions held down profits from foreign

operations. Despite the lackluster growth in profits, the level of profitability—for
instance, as measured by the ratio of profits to sales—remained high, in aggregate.
Early in the period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds
rose significantly. Amid the associated capital losses for investors, bond mutual funds
and bond exchange-traded funds experienced very heavy net redemptions in June.
Outflows from both types of funds slowed in early July but remained sizable. Liquidity
in the secondary market for corporate bonds appeared to deteriorate early in the
intermeeting period but recovered more recently. For the period as a whole, yields on
investment-grade bonds moved about in line with Treasury yields. However, yields on
speculative-grade bonds were little changed, on net, with their risk spreads narrowing
noticeably.
Available indicators suggest that the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations
continued to be solid on the whole. Readings on the six-month trailing bond default rate
and the KMV expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms both remained low
by historical standards. The volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds that were upgraded
by Moody’s Investors Service in the second quarter was roughly matched by the volume
of downgrades, leaving little net imprint on the overall distribution of ratings.

However, benchmark sovereign yields and longer-dated OIS rates in the euro area and the a l

that the market-implied rise in the expected future path of its policy rate was not
warranted by recent developments in the domestic economy. On net, 10-year sovereign
yields in Germany were little changed, and U.K. yields rose 18 basis points, in part
because of the release of stronger-than-expected U.K. service-sector data during the
period. Japanese government bond yields were fairly stable over the period after
experiencing substantial volatility in May.

advanced foreign economies, consistent with the larger increase in U.S. interest rates than
in foreign rates over the period. Emerging market economy (EME) currencies generally
depreciated following the June FOMC communications and again after the release of the
June employment report, but they subsequently recovered somewhat in response to
statements from FOMC officials, which lessened concerns about near-term policy
tightening. The Mexican peso rebounded particularly robustly, ending the period up
about 3 percent. In contrast, weak macroeconomic data, along with political tensions and
social unrest, weighed on the Brazilian real, which depreciated 2¼ percent, on net,
against the dollar despite official foreign exchange intervention to support the currency.
Foreign equity prices mirrored those in the United States, declining after the June
FOMC meeting but rebounding later. Euro-area stock prices increased slightly, on
balance, but the Nikkei index rose 13½ percent, reflecting better-than-expected data on
industrial production and business sentiment in Japan. Equity prices were up in most
EMEs, with the prominent exception of China. Chinese equity prices declined
5¼ percent as investors exhibited concern over further signs that the economy was
slowing and over recent volatility in Chinese interbank funding markets (see the box
“Recent Developments in China’s Interbank Market” in the International Economic
Developments and Outlook section). Outflows from emerging market equity and bond
funds were particularly rapid in late June but moderated in July (see the box “Assessing
s
Recent Developments in EME Asset Markets”). In response to inflationary pressures that t

Assessing Recent Developments in EME Asset Markets
Foreign interest rates have increased substantially since the May FOMC meeting (that is, two
meetings ago), rising along with U.S. Treasury yields, as can be seen in the upper‐left figure on the
next page. Emerging market yields have increased even more than rates in the United States and
other advanced economies. In addition, emerging market equity prices have declined almost
3 percent on net over the same period amid large outflows from mutual funds investing in equities
and bonds of the emerging market economies (EMEs) (upper‐right figure), and EME currencies have
depreciated over 3 percent against the dollar on average.1
To be sure, it is not surprising to see foreign yields rise in response to an increase in U.S. yields as
investors rebalance their portfolios toward U.S. assets. These reallocations also likely contributed to
declines in foreign equity prices and depreciation of some foreign currencies against the dollar. In
addition, prospects of tighter monetary policies in response to capital outflows and the inflationary
pressures created by depreciating currencies may have boosted yields. Furthermore, increased
market uncertainty about the future path of U.S. interest rates, reflected in higher implied volatilities
in U.S. and foreign markets, may have added to global term premiums.
At this juncture, however, emerging markets may have been particularly sensitive to the combination
of rising rates in the advanced economies and increasing volatility. Over the past several years, low
and stable interest rates in the advanced economies prompted some investors to seek higher returns
via EME “carry trades”—investments in EME debt funded by borrowing in the advanced
economies—which are highly sensitive to both narrowing interest rate differentials and increased
market volatility. Furthermore, although EME macroeconomic and financial policies have improved
considerably in recent years, these countries still tend to have lower credit ratings than the major
advanced economies, and lower‐rated assets tend to be affected more heavily by any pullback from
risk. Finally, the recent run‐up in U.S. rates occurred as macroeconomic indicators showed growth to
s
n t be slowing in many EMEs, and this likely also decreased the attractiveness of EME investments.
e
m
p How much of the turbulence in emerging markets over the past several months represents a typical
o
e l reaction to movements in U.S. financial markets and how much appears to reflect the specific
v
e circumstances of this period? To address this question, we estimated a model relating changes in
D
EME sovereign yields, exchange rates, and equity prices to a set of U.S. financial market variables, as
l
i a well as global commodity prices, estimated over the period from the end of 2001 to mid‐2012.2 As can
c
n be seen in the lower‐left figure on the next page, EME yields declined more than our empirical model
a
n predicts through early this year, as interest rates and interest‐rate volatility in advanced economies
i
F
remained quite low and capital flows to EMEs surged. The subsequent sharp reversal in EME yields in
May and June was also more than our empirical model predicts. Similarly, the dollar fell a bit more
against EME currencies than the empirical model predicts before the May FOMC meeting (lower‐
middle figure) and then rebounded more strongly thereafter. And the recent decline in EME equity
prices (lower‐right figure) is also unusual; ordinarily, as indicated by the prediction from our empirical
model, EME equity prices move fairly closely with U.S. equity prices, but stock prices in EMEs started
moving down early this year and then plunged after April.
1 Based on the EME dollar index excluding China and India.
2 The U.S. financial variables included in the model are the 10‐year Treasury yield, the implied‐volatility index
(VIX), the return of the S&P 500 index, and the yield spread of BBB‐rated corporate bonds over Treasury securities.

In sum, some EME asset price increases through the early part of this year appear to have been
outsized, likely fueled in part, as discussed above, by carry trades predicated not only on low
interest rates but also on an abnormally low level of market volatility. Perhaps as a result, the
recent rise in U.S. interest rates and associated increase in volatility appears to have depressed EME
financial markets to an unusual degree. The slowing of EME economic growth also appears to have
played a role, leading stock prices in EMEs to turn down well before they did in the advanced
economies and likely exacerbating the weakness of EME asset prices more generally since May.
Although EME asset prices have recovered slightly and the pace of outflows has slowed in July,
questions remain regarding how EME financial markets will react going forward to the eventual
normalization of interest rates and monetary policies in advanced economies. We cannot rule out
the possibility that further increases in U.S. interest rates will again exert outsized effects on EMEs.
However, it is possible that at least some of the positioning that relied, perhaps excessively, on low
and stable U.S. interest rates has been reduced, and this could lessen the reaction that might occur
when U.S. yields rise further.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggest that foreign official investors sold U.S.
assets again in June, as some EMEs may have used the proceeds to fund intervention
efforts to support their currencies.
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE
Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses were mixed over the intermeeting period.
Reflecting the reduced incentive to refinance as longer-term interest rates rose, the pace
of gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade bonds dropped in June. By
contrast, the net issuance of CP remained positive. Corporate leveraged loan issuance
continued to be robust, as the demand for these floating-rate instruments among investors
stayed strong.
Turning to equity finance, gross issuance by nonfinancial firms maintained its
recent strength in June, boosted by robust initial public offerings and a surge in the
volume of secondary equity offerings. Largely owing to completion of a few large deals,
the volume of cash-financed mergers edged up some in the second quarter, but overall
activity remained sluggish by historical standards. Announcements of share repurchase
programs in the second quarter suggested that equity retirement by nonfinancial
corporations is likely to continue at a brisk pace.
s
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) continued to recover n t
e
m
slowly. CRE lending at commercial banks moved up again in the second quarter, and
p
o
responses to the July SLOOS indicated that lending standards for CRE loans eased l
e
v
somewhat over the past three months, with demand picking up. Commercial property e
D
vacancy and delinquency rates, although still elevated, declined further. Moreover, a l
i
c
liquidity conditions in the commercial property market continued to improve, with n
a
n
increased sales, shorter durations on the market, and smaller gaps between asking and i
F
sales prices. In addition, CMBS issuance remained strong despite widening spreads that
were apparently associated with the heightened volatility in fixed-income markets during
the period.
Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds rose sharply over the
intermeeting period, about matching the increase in yields on Treasury securities.
Nevertheless, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained solid in June and
was split roughly evenly between refunding and new-capital issuance. However, net
issuance of long-term bonds became deeply negative, reflecting outsized bond

retirements by state and local governments. Meanwhile, although rating downgrades of
municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the first
quarter, higher-frequency data on ratings changes suggested that this trend is likely to
have been reversed in the second quarter amid some easing of state and local budget
pressures.
Over the intermeeting period, the City of Detroit filed for bankruptcy, with about
$18 billion of debt reportedly being affected. The filing was widely anticipated by
market participants, and the broad market reaction was muted. Longer-tenor municipal
bond yields across states with a variety of credit ratings traded 5 to 10 basis points higher
in the days following the announcement. CDS spreads on the state of Michigan were
little changed over the period, as were the spreads on the MCDX, which is a broad CDS
index of municipal obligations.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Financing conditions in the household sector continued to improve in recent
months. Although the increase in mortgage rates will likely weigh somewhat on the
housing sector going forward, most factors affecting this sector still remained favorable
over the intermeeting period. Mortgage purchase applications held about steady, even as
refinancing applications fell off sharply with the rise in mortgage rates. New

the midpoints of the wide range those standards have occupied since 2005—and, in some
cases, tighter than they were at this time last year.
Consumer credit continued to expand at a solid pace in May, driven by sustained
growth in student loans originated by the federal government and in auto loans.
Although revolving credit balances stepped up in May, the year-over-year increase
continued to be quite small. Interest rates on credit card mail offers remained close to
their historical highs, while interest rates on auto loans generally stayed flat at low levels
in recent weeks despite the appreciable increase in Treasury yields. Consumer credit
delinquency rates, with the exception of those on student loans, continued to decline in
recent months. Consumer credit ABS issuance was moderate in June, after a very strong
month in May, and decreased further in July, reportedly reflecting in part the heightened
market uncertainty that prevailed over the intermeeting period.
In the July SLOOS, moderate net fractions of respondents reportedly eased
standards and terms on, and experienced stronger demand for, credit card loans and auto
loans. Banks reported little change in standards on, and some strengthening in demand
for, other consumer loans. Standards on auto loans were reported to be close to the
midpoint of their range since 2005. In contrast, standards on prime credit card loans were
said to be tighter than the midpoint of their range over the same period.

banks indicated having eased standards on C&I loans, and moderate-to-large net fractions
reported having eased pricing terms on such loans. However, for the second consecutive
survey, demand for C&I loans reportedly weakened, particularly at larger banks. A large
number of banks indicated that standards on most types of C&I loans were currently
easier than the midpoints of the respective ranges that those standards have occupied
since 2005. Banks also indicated that the levels of standards on all three types of CRE
loans were returning to the midpoints of their recent ranges, although standards for
construction and land development loans reportedly remain somewhat tighter than those
for nonfarm nonresidential and multifamily loans.
The book value of banks’ securities holdings fell slightly in the second quarter as
several large banks completed sizable sales. In addition, the recent rise in longer-term
interest rates reduced the market value of securities held in banks’ available-for-sale
(AFS) portfolios; indeed, banks reported a decline of about $40 billion in net unrealized
gains on their AFS securities over the second quarter—the largest quarterly decline since
data became available in 1996.9 Analysis by the staff suggests that the recent sensitivity
is in line with the historical relationship between changes in the value of banks’ AFS
securities and changes in long-term interest rates.
M2 grew at an annual rate of 6¾ percent in June and July, supported by flows into

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first
scenario, term premiums and long-term interest rates are persistently higher than in the
baseline and so restrain the recovery. The second scenario also features higher long-term
interest rates than in the baseline, but in this case they reflect a move toward greater risk
appetite, so the higher rates are associated with a rising stock market, greater optimism,
and a faster economic recovery. The third scenario considers the risk that the recent
softness in consumer price inflation turns out to be more persistent than expected. The
fourth scenario explores the possibility that various headwinds impose greater restraint on
household spending than anticipated in the baseline, and the fifth, the possibility that the
baseline forecast may be underestimating the persistence of supply-side damage from the
recent recession and slow recovery. The final two scenarios explore risks to the U.S.
economy from foreign economic developments—in the sixth scenario, that growth in
China is weaker than we currently anticipate, and in the seventh, that the exchange value
of the dollar is stronger than in the baseline.
We generate the first five scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. In the FRB/US simulations, as in the baseline
forecast, the federal funds rate follows an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
subject to the FOMC’s thresholds for the unemployment rate and projected inflation. For
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy rule, subject to the same
thresholds but employing an alternative concept of resource utilization.1 In all cases, we
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.

factors influencing term premiums is limited, and Treasury yields could climb even more
quickly than we project for any number of reasons, including an increase in inflation risk
premiums or a further unexpected repositioning of investors in anticipation of a cessation
of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve. In this scenario, long-term interest rates are
assumed to run persistently above baseline and are about 75 basis points higher than in
the baseline forecast by early next year. The resulting tightening in overall financial
conditions shaves about ¾ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of real
GDP through 2015. The unemployment rate remains above 7 percent through early
2015, while inflation runs close to 1½ percent through the end of 2016. The shortfall in
economic performance relative to the baseline causes the first increase in the federal
funds rate to be delayed until late 2016.
Increased Risk Appetite
The fact that the substantial rise in Treasury yields since April has coincided with
a pronounced run-up in stock market values could point to an increasing willingness of
investors to bear risk. In this scenario, we assume that this shift in risk appetites
continues, so that the increase in term premiums in the previous scenario is accompanied
by a path for equity prices that is higher than assumed in the baseline. As a result, the
level of households’ stock market wealth is 13 percent above baseline at the end of 2014.
Similarly, households and businesses become more optimistic, further stimulating
aggregate demand. Real GDP accelerates to a growth rate of 5 percent in 2014, bringing
the unemployment rate below 6½ percent by the third quarter of 2014. Starting in 2015,
consumer price inflation is ¼ percentage point higher than baseline. The federal funds
rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2014, three
quarters earlier than in the baseline.
Low Inflation
In the baseline forecast, recent low readings on core inflation are anticipated to be
partially transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradually moves back toward
2 percent. In this scenario, the deceleration of core consumer prices over the past year
instead proves to be a harbinger of a longer-lasting decline in actual inflation, y

accompanied by a decrease in long-run inflation expectations. Inflation is below i
a

bond premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long-term interest rates, thereby
modestly restraining household and business spending and boosting unemployment
relative to the baseline over the next few years. While the unemployment rate falls below
its 6½ percent threshold in the third quarter of 2016, the policy rule does not prescribe the
first increase in the federal funds rate until mid-2017. By then, the unemployment rate is
nearly at its natural rate. But given the persistent shift in inflation expectations, inflation
remains well below the FOMC’s long-run objective.
Consumer Restraint
In the baseline forecast, strong gains in household spending are an important
driver of the projected acceleration in the recovery. But a number of risks surround this
outlook. In particular, the staff projection relies on a significant response of spending to
higher levels of wealth, which may not materialize. Furthermore, the recent tax increases
may weigh more persistently on spending than we have allowed in the baseline, and
depressed expectations of future income gains may also restrain household spending by
more than we assume. Finally, recent increases in mortgage interest rates may impose a
greater drag on residential construction than in the baseline. In this scenario, personal
consumption expenditures and residential construction spending rise considerably more
slowly than in the baseline and the personal saving rate remains near recent levels
through 2015, rather than falling as in the baseline. Consequently, the unemployment
rate stays above 7 percent through the end of 2016. Because margins of resource slack
are still wide, inflation remains close to 1½ percent rather than rising. With inflation
persistently below the FOMC’s longer-run objective and the unemployment rate far
above its natural rate, the federal funds rate stays near zero through 2017.
Supply-Side Damage
In previous Tealbooks, we revised down our estimates of potential GDP in light
of a falling unemployment rate and modest gains in real GDP in recent years. But it is
possible that we may still be underestimating the damage done to aggregate supply
because of the recession and slow recovery. This scenario assumes that potential output
has been expanding at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent since 2011, ½ percentage point y
t
n
lower than in the baseline; this slower pace of growth in potential output is assumed to i
a
t
r
continue through 2015. Actual output in this scenario stands 2¾ percent below potential e
c
n
at the beginning of the simulation, implying an output gap that is 1½ percentage points U
&
narrower than in the baseline. Real GDP rises at a rate below 2½ percent per year, on
s

average, through 2015, but the unemployment rate nonetheless continues to decline at s

roughly the same pace as it has since late 2010 and falls below its threshold value by the
third quarter of 2014. Accordingly, the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective
lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2014, three quarters earlier than in the baseline.
Weaker Growth in China
Although real GDP growth in China appears to have slowed in the first half of
this year, in our baseline forecast we expect it to return to a pace close to 8 percent by the
first half of 2014. But important downside risks attend this outlook, including a sharp
slowdown in credit growth, a real estate bust, and a collapse in construction spending. In
this scenario, we assume that real GDP growth in China slows to only 5 percent over the
next year, before gradually returning to the baseline. Moreover, we assume that the
slowdown in China’s economy has pronounced spillovers to other major U.S. trading
partners in emerging Asia. In this environment, the trade-weighted exchange value of the
dollar averages about 3 percent higher than in the baseline over the next two years. U.S.
real net exports decline relative to the baseline in response to weaker foreign economic
growth and the dollar’s appreciation. U.S. real GDP expands only 2½ percent in 2014,
and the unemployment rate is still above 7 percent at the end of next year, about
½ percentage point higher than in the baseline. Core PCE inflation remains below
1½ percent until the end of 2015, because of both the appreciation in the dollar and lower
resource utilization. With a higher unemployment rate, the federal funds rate lifts off
from its effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2016.
Stronger Dollar
In light of the pronounced response of international financial markets to recent
increases in U.S. interest rates, we cannot preclude the possibility that the foreign
exchange value of the dollar will respond to the projected further increases in U.S.
interest rates to a greater extent than we have assumed. To capture this possibility, this
scenario introduces a shock to the foreign exchange risk premium that causes the dollar to
rise 10 percent above baseline by the first half of next year before gradually receding.
The stronger dollar restrains U.S. real net exports and causes the trade balance as a share
of GDP to fall 1½ percentage points by the end of 2014. Growth in U.S. real GDP slows y
t
n
to 2½ percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate remains above 7 percent throughout i
a
t
r
next year, about ¼ percentage point higher than in our baseline. Core inflation falls to e
c
n
1 percent in 2014, because of weaker U.S. real activity and lower import prices. With a U
&
higher unemployment rate and lower inflation, the federal funds rate lifts off from its
s
