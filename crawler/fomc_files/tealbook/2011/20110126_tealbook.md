Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
On balance, the incoming news on economic activity has taken on a stronger tenor D
n
since the December Tealbook. Consumer spending picked up sharply in the fourth o
c
E
quarter of 2010, and—apart from its volatile motor vehicle component—business
c
i
t
investment in equipment and software has exhibited considerable vigor. Industrial s
e
m
production (IP) has also posted solid gains in recent months. By contrast, conditions in o
D
the labor market have improved only modestly, and the housing market remains
moribund. After weighing the various indicators, we estimate that real GDP increased at
an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter, 1¼ percentage points faster than we
had projected in the most recent Tealbook.
Because the economy appears to have entered 2011 with a bit more momentum
than we had anticipated in our previous forecast, we have nudged up our projections for
growth over the next few quarters. However, we did not make any other material
changes to the medium-term outlook, which had already featured an appreciable
acceleration in real GDP this year and a further step-up in growth in 2012. The
conditioning assumptions underlying the forecast are virtually the same as those in the
December Tealbook, and given the limited improvement in the labor market to date and
the financial constraints and other headwinds that continue to weigh on spending and
production (as well as the usual noisiness of the high-frequency data), we were reluctant
to extrapolate more than a little of the positive surprise going forward. As a result, our
point estimates for real GDP growth, at 3.8 percent in 2011 and 4.4 percent in 2012, are
nearly unchanged from our previous projection. Nevertheless, the level of real GDP is a
little higher throughout the projection period. Furthermore, we see the incoming
information as suggesting that the downside risks to the outlook have diminished and that
the recovery is on a somewhat firmer footing than was apparent in December.
As for inflation, the incoming data on core consumer prices have been about in
line with our expectations. But with the projected margin of slack a little smaller than in
the December Tealbook, and with some additional upward pressure on domestic prices
from the pass-through of higher energy and import prices, we have added 0.1 percentage
point to our forecast for core inflation, which is now expected to be 1 percent in both
2011 and 2012. Given our projections for consumer food and energy prices, overall

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
D
e
n
o
Monetary Policy c
E
c
We have made only minor adjustments to our assumptions for monetary policy i
t
s
e
this round. As in the December Tealbook, we assume that the FOMC will hold the target m
o
federal funds rate in the current range of 0 to ¼ percent until the first quarter of 2013. D
We also assume that the Federal Reserve will expand its holdings of longer-term
securities by about $80 billion per month through the second quarter of 2011, slightly
quicker than in the December Tealbook. The faster pace of purchases was announced by
the Open Market Desk on January 12 and is anticipated to still bring the securities
holdings in the SOMA portfolio to about $2.6 trillion. In addition, we continue to assume
that the Federal Reserve will reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings
through early 2013.
Financial Conditions
Our projections of long-term interest rates are similar to those in the December
Tealbook. The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has increased about 10 basis points
more than we anticipated, and we have slightly raised the projected level of this yield in
the near term. However, we had already been expecting Treasury yields to move up
significantly over the medium term, and we have interpreted the recent rise as an earlier
realization of that increase than we had anticipated. As a result, we did not revise the
projected level of the 10-year Treasury yield in 2012. As has been true for some time,
the main factor contributing to the projected rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the
medium term is the movement of the valuation window through the projected period of
near-zero short-term interest rates. Since the December Tealbook, yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds and interest rates on conforming fixed-rate mortgages have
changed little, on net, and we have made only negligible revisions to the projections for
those interest rates.
The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is about 3 percent above the level
anticipated in the December Tealbook. Stock prices have reportedly been boosted by
growing confidence among market participants in the strength of the economic recovery.
Nevertheless, the equity premium remains well above longer-run norms. Therefore, we
Page 3 of 105

--- Page 7 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 19, 2011
k
o
o
l
u t expect stock prices to continue to increase at an elevated pace over the projection period,
O
on the order of 11 percent per year, as the equity premium falls back to more typical
&
e l levels.
v
e
D
n Recent readings point to renewed weakness in house prices. Most notably, the
o
c
E CoreLogic repeat sales index fell 1½ percent in November, somewhat more than we had
c
i
t expected, and now stands below its previous trough in early 2009. These data have led us
s
e
m
to mark down the level of home prices throughout the projection period about 1 percent.
o
D
Fiscal Policy
We have made only small changes to our fiscal policy assumptions.1 As before,
we assume that appropriations for discretionary spending in fiscal years 2011 and 2012
will be roughly constant in nominal terms and that current tax policies will remain in
place. Thus, we continue to expect that federal fiscal policy actions will be a roughly
neutral influence on aggregate demand in 2011 as the impetus from the one-year cut in
social insurance taxes and from the business expensing provision is essentially offset by
some reduction in stimulus-related grants to state and local governments. In 2012, fiscal
actions are expected to impose a drag of about 1 percent of GDP as the payroll tax cuts
lapse, the expensing provision is scaled back, the Emergency Unemployment
Compensation (EUC) program is phased out, and the stimulus grants are essentially
exhausted.
As in the December projection, we expect the budget deficit to reach $1.4 trillion
(9 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2011 and then narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012 (around
7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the further tapering off of stimulus-related
policies and the higher revenues associated with a faster pace of economic activity.
Correspondingly, federal debt is projected to rise to 71 percent of GDP at the end of
fiscal 2012.
1 While the fiscal package enacted in December is close to what we had assumed in the previous
Tealbook, it differs in two minor ways. First, it provides slightly higher emergency unemployment benefits
in 2011 than we had anticipated. Second, it allows businesses to claim 50 percent bonus depreciation on
most equipment and software acquired in 2012, in addition to the full expensing in 2011 assumed in our
December forecast.

Foreign Activity and the Dollar u t
O
The incoming data on activity abroad have also been stronger than we had &
l
anticipated and suggest that foreign real GDP expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the e
v
e
fourth quarter, beating its third-quarter showing by 1 percentage point. The acceleration D
n
was driven by faster growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs), while activity in o
c
E
the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) remained sluggish. Going forward, we project c
i
t
overall foreign growth to move up to more than 3½ percent in 2012—an outlook that is a e s
m
little stronger than in the December Tealbook. Activity in the EMEs should remain o
D
robust over the forecast period, and growth in the AFEs is expected to pick up, although
fiscal consolidation in some advanced countries and an uneven lifting of financial stresses
in Europe will likely temper the recovery.
The real value of the dollar is currently about 1 percent lower than we had
projected at the time of the December forecast, and the staff’s expectations for foreign
monetary policy rates over the forecast period have been revised up by an amount similar
to the market’s expectations. In light of these developments, the projected path for the
broad real dollar starts at a lower level but follows the same contour as in the December
forecast. This path has the dollar depreciating at an annual rate of about 3 percent over
the rest of 2011 and at a somewhat faster pace in 2012, as the firming global recovery
lessens official resistance in the emerging Asian economies to more-rapid currency
appreciation against the dollar.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
Oil prices have moved higher relative to the December Tealbook projection as
favorable incoming data on economic activity both in the United States and abroad
suggest a more robust outlook for global oil demand. The spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed on January 18 at $91 per barrel, $3 higher than at the
time of the December Tealbook, and prices of futures contracts through the end of 2012
have moved up more than twice that amount.2 Based on these futures quotes, we project
that the spot price of WTI will end 2012 at nearly $96 per barrel, more than $6 higher
than in the previous Tealbook.
2 Spot prices of other grades of crude oil have risen more than the WTI spot price, in large part
because near-record high inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, have held recent
gains in spot WTI in check.

What Explains the Recent Increase in Commodity Prices?
&
l
e
v
e After changing little, on net, during the first half of 2010, commodity prices
D
started to move up in the late summer and have continued to increase at a brisk
n
o pace in recent months (see figure below). The price increases have been broad-
c
E based, with prices for metals, foods, and oil all recording sizable gains. As
c
i indicated in the left figure on the facing page, the prices of many industrial
t
s
e commodities now exceed their 2008 peaks, although oil is a notable exception.
m
o
D
We interpret the recent rise in commodity prices as primarily reflecting
developments in fundamentals, in particular the interaction of robust increases in
global demand with a number of idiosyncratic supply constraints. A recovery in
world industrial production (see left figure on the facing page), led by strong
economic growth in the emerging market economies, pushed demand for oil and
many metals above pre-crisis peaks. These increases in demand have generally
exceeded the response of supply, such that reported inventories of oil and many
metals have started to edge down from the elevated levels that had persisted
since the onset of the financial crisis. Agricultural prices also have been pushed
higher by a strong rise in demand. In addition, adverse weather conditions have
reduced harvests and curtailed supplies of important products in a number of key
exporting countries, including Russia and Ukraine (wheat) and the United States
and South America (corn).
The exchange value of the dollar was an additional factor contributing to dollar-
denominated commodity price movements through much of 2010. Movements
in commodity prices generally tracked the dollar through November. Since late
November, however, the increases in commodity prices seem mainly to have
reflected increased optimism regarding prospects for global economic growth,
as the dollar has leveled out but commodity prices have continued to climb.

O
&
l
Tracking futures prices, our forecast calls for commodity prices to flatten out at e
v
e
their current elevated level. This forecast is consistent with a scenario in which D
supply expands to meet increased demand. In the oil market we assume that the n
o
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will eventually c
E
increase production quotas, cutting into the 6 million barrel per day buffer of c
i
t
spare capacity that it has maintained over the past two years (see right figure s
e
below). In addition, agricultural output is expected to recover from recent m
o
weather-related disruptions, and metals supply should edge up, partly in D
response to higher prices. As usual, the uncertainty around this forecast is
considerable and, although we have found no better framework for forecasting
commodity prices, the track record of futures prices has been poor. At any rate,
stronger-than-expected global growth or additional supply disruptions likely
would push commodity prices still higher.

u t Since the December Tealbook, prices for a broad array of nonfuel commodities
O
have continued to move up. The gains have been supported by sizable increases in
&
e l demand, particularly in the EMEs, as well as shortfalls in supply in some cases (see the
v
e
D box “What Explains the Recent Increase in Commodity Prices?” for additional detail).
n
o Consistent with quotes from futures markets, we project that nonfuel commodity prices
c
E
will rise more than 6 percent (not at an annual rate) in the current quarter but will then
c
i
t
s flatten out over the remainder of the forecast period.
e

D
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
As noted above, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of
3¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. Although residential construction remained
weak, consumer spending rose sharply, and—leaving aside a plunge in its volatile motor
vehicle component—business outlays for equipment posted another hefty gain. Net
exports appear to have contributed a remarkable 3½ percentage points at an annual rate to
growth last quarter, but this positive contribution was partially offset in our forecast by a
marked slowing in the pace of inventory investment. We expect real GDP to increase
3½ percent in the first quarter as consumer spending and business fixed investment
continue to rise briskly, while net exports and inventory investment flatten out.
Labor Markets
The incoming information indicates that labor demand has continued to increase
at a gradual pace. In the payroll survey, private nonfarm employment rose 113,000 in
December—close to the forecast in the previous Tealbook—and was up about 130,000
per month, on average, over the last three months of 2010, similar to the average pace
over the first nine months of the year. In the household survey, the unemployment rate
fell 0.4 percentage point in December to 9.4 percent; this decline—which in part was
associated with a surprising drop in the participation rate—exceeded our expectations and
more than reversed the run-up in the jobless rate that had occurred in October and
November.
Other indicators also point to ongoing modest improvements in labor market
conditions. The weekly data for initial claims for unemployment insurance have been
erratic of late, but the four-week moving average has continued to move down and now
stands near its lowest level since August 2008. The drop in recent job losers in the
December labor market report also suggests that layoffs have continued to ease.
Meanwhile, indicators of hiring appear mixed: Although data from JOLTS suggest that

u t hiring is no better now than it was a few months ago, measures of job openings and
O
employers’ hiring plans have shown some noticeable improvement.
&
l
e
v
e Putting this information together, we continue to expect the pace of employment
D
n growth to pick up in coming months, with private payroll increases projected to average
o
c
E 160,000 per month in the first quarter. The projected pickup in job growth is a bit less
c
i
t than in our previous forecast, largely because the trajectory of monthly payroll data
s
e
m
heading into 2011 now looks a little shallower than before. In addition, we expect the
o
D
unemployment rate to reverse some of its outsized December decline in January before
edging back down.
The Industrial Sector
After a pause during the summer and early autumn, gains in manufacturing
production seem to have picked up recently, and we expect this faster pace of output
growth to continue in coming months. Outside of motor vehicles, factory output posted
widespread gains in November and December, and the recent strength in new orders and
in national and regional purchasing managers’ reports points to further solid increases in
production in early 2011. And, while total motor vehicle production stepped down to an
annual rate of 7¾ million units in the fourth quarter, assemblies are scheduled to move up
to an 8½ million unit pace in the current quarter as automakers seek to restock dealer
inventories that had been drawn down by unexpectedly strong consumer demand late last
year. All told, we project that manufacturing production will increase at an annual rate of
nearly 7 percent in the current quarter after rising 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter.
Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing IP is expected to rise at a 5½ percent rate in the
current quarter after posting a 4½ percent gain in the fourth quarter.
Household Spending
We estimate that real PCE rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the fourth quarter,
nearly 1½ percentage points faster than we anticipated in the previous Tealbook and
roughly twice the average pace over the first three quarters of the year. Sales of light
vehicles rose to an annual rate of 12¼ million units in the fourth quarter, ¾ million units
higher than in the third quarter and the best quarterly reading since mid-2008 (see the box
“Sales of Light Vehicles in the Downturn and Recovery” for additional detail). And
although retail sales of non-auto goods were up only a little in December, that slowing

Sales of Light Vehicles in the Downturn and Recovery
&
l
e
v
The plunge in sales of light motor vehicles in the recent recession was large by historical e
D
standards, exceeding the drops that followed the oil shocks and recessions of the 1970s and
n
early 1980s. Vehicle sales, the black line in the left figure below, declined 40 percent o
c
between the end of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009, and the drop in vehicle spending E
c
accounted for about one-half of the decline in overall final sales over this period. While the i
t
s
rise in unemployment and the contraction in household wealth were key contributors to the e
m
decline in vehicle sales, the severity of the drop was exacerbated by a substantial disruption o
D
to auto lending, a steep run-up in gasoline prices through the summer of 2008, and a spate
of bankruptcies in the motor vehicle industry that depressed the value of trade-in vehicles
for some households.
Light vehicle sales began to recover in the second half of 2009, when the economy and
financial markets began to stabilize and portions of the U.S. auto industry had been
restructured. The federal government’s vehicle scrappage incentive program (“Cash for
Clunkers”) provided a temporary boost to sales in the summer of 2009, but gains in sales
otherwise remained modest through the summer of 2010. The recovery in vehicle demand
picked up steam near the end of 2010, as consumer sentiment toward car-buying conditions
edged up, the labor market improved a bit more, and automakers raised sales incentives.
Sales were also supported by low interest rates, a greater willingness by lenders to extend
credit to households with lower credit scores, and the continued recovery of securitization.
Despite the recent upturn in vehicle demand, sales remain well below the staff’s underlying
sales trend (the red line in the left figure below), which is estimated from population
growth, long-run changes in income, and patterns of scrappage. Although we expect sales
to rise more rapidly in 2011 and 2012, sales are still expected to fall short of their trend. As
shown in the right figure below, the per capita stock of light vehicles declined in 2008 and
2009 after having been relatively flat, on net, over the past decade; the pace of sales we
anticipate in the staff forecast would likely cause vehicle stocks to recede further over the
next two years. This shortfall poses an upside risk to the forecast.

followed appreciable gains in October and November.3 Looking forward, consumer u t
O
spending should get a boost in the current quarter from the start of the temporary payroll
&
tax reduction, but we see little else to suggest that the sharp pickup in spending growth in e l
v
e
late 2010 will be sustained. In particular, given relatively subdued gains projected for D
n
employment and wage income in coming months, along with the relatively low level of o
c
E
consumer sentiment through early January, we expect PCE growth to ease back to
c
i
t
3 percent this quarter—a pace more in line with the underlying fundamentals. s

D
In an environment of soft demand and a large inventory of foreclosed or
distressed properties on the market, homebuilding has stayed at a slow pace. In the
single-family sector, new units were started at an average annual rate of only
436,000 units in the fourth quarter, and home sales—though up a little from the pace that
prevailed just after the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit—remained near cyclical
lows. Households’ concerns about the prospects for jobs and incomes are likely
continuing to weigh on housing demand, and although conventional mortgage rates are
still low by historical norms, many households do not have the down payment or good
credit history required to obtain such loans. Moreover, as noted, house prices have
softened again and likely will remain under pressure in coming quarters from a continued
high level of distress sales; thus, expectations of further declines in house prices may also
be restraining demand. Given these factors, we expect little, if any, improvement in
housing activity in early 2011.
Business Investment
Real investment in equipment and software (E&S) appears to have posted a
relatively meager gain in the fourth quarter after rising nearly 20 percent over the
previous four quarters. The deceleration was due mainly to a sharp drop in net outlays on
motor vehicles as fleet sales to businesses paused after several quarters of strong
purchases by rental car companies and as business sales of used cars to consumers (which
are treated as a negative for E&S in the NIPAs) surged. Apart from transportation
equipment, outlays for E&S appear to have risen at an annual rate of about 11 percent last
quarter, the same as the gain in the third quarter.
3 Moreover, some holiday-related spending seems to have shifted over time from December to
January and February—a phenomenon that is probably not fully captured in the seasonal adjustment
factors.

Looking ahead, business outlays for motor vehicles should rebound in the current u t
O
quarter as fleet sales rise and a step-up in purchases of heavy trucks follows the upturn in
&
orders for these vehicles in late 2010. Meanwhile, new orders for nondefense capital e l
v
e
goods excluding aircraft have been running above shipments for several months, pointing D
n
to further near-term increases in shipments. The fundamentals are also consistent with o
c
E
solid near-term gains in E&S outlays: Output growth has picked up; the latest readings
c
i
t
on business conditions are relatively upbeat; and credit conditions, though probably still s
e
m
tight for small businesses, have generally continued to improve. Accordingly, our o
D
projection has real E&S outlays rising at an annual rate of 13½ percent in the current
quarter after a gain of 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
Nonresidential construction continues to be constrained by high vacancy rates,
low property values, and tight lending conditions. Based on monthly data through
November, we estimate that real nonresidential construction outside of drilling and
mining was little changed in the fourth quarter at a level about 40 percent below that of
early 2008. Consistent with recent readings on architectural billings—which tend to be a
useful indicator of building activity several months out—we expect nonresidential
construction to remain near this level in early 2011. Given the high price of crude oil,
investment in drilling and mining structures should continue to move up in the near term,
but the increases in our forecast are considerably smaller than those realized over the first
three quarters of 2010.
Real nonfarm inventory investment appears to have slowed substantially in the
fourth quarter after having soared in the third quarter; this slowing is estimated to have
subtracted 3 percentage points at an annual rate from GDP growth. Roughly one-half of
the fourth-quarter downswing is associated with a drawdown of motor vehicle stocks
after an accumulation in the third quarter. Stocks outside the motor vehicle sector also
seem to have accumulated less rapidly in the fourth quarter than they did in the third
quarter, judging from the relatively small increases in the book value of manufacturing
and trade stocks in October and November. Overall, inventories appear well aligned with
sales: Book-value inventory-sales ratios toward the end of 2010 were close to their pre-
recession norms, and with the exception of construction materials, chemicals, and
primary metals, most sectors represented in the staff’s flow of goods system appear to
have reasonably comfortable inventory positions. In our forecast for the current quarter,
inventory investment moves up somewhat (mainly because of a rise in motor vehicle
stocks) and thus should be a small plus for real GDP growth.

u t Government
O
& After factoring in the information on defense expenditures from the Monthly
l
e Treasury Statements for November and December, we estimate that real federal
v
e
D purchases rose at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter after two quarters of
n
o much larger gains; we expect purchases to rise modestly in the current quarter as well. In
c
E
c the state and local sector, ongoing fiscal pressures are being reflected in further job cuts
i
t
e s while construction outlays—though erratic from quarter to quarter—continue to trend up
m
o after the steep declines of late 2009 and early 2010. In our forecast, real purchases by
D
state and local governments post a small decline in the fourth quarter after two quarters of
slight increases, and they are expected to be unchanged in the current quarter; these
relatively small ups and downs largely reflect swings in construction outlays.
Foreign Trade
After taking on board the trade data for October and November, we estimate that
real imports of goods and services fell at an annual rate of nearly 14 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2010, 10 percentage points more than we anticipated in the December
Tealbook. This dramatic drop in imports followed two quarters of rapid growth and was
largely attributable to a steep decline in reported real oil imports, part of which owed to
quirky seasonal adjustment factors. But it also reflected a contraction in non-oil imports,
as the vigorous rebound of imports from their depressed levels during the financial crisis
appears to have run its course. Given the solid pace of activity in the United States, as
well as the likelihood that some of the weakness in imports in the fourth quarter was due
to temporary factors, we expect real import growth to rebound at an annual rate of more
than 9 percent in the first quarter, 4½ percentage points faster than in our previous
forecast.
Supported by brisk foreign demand and some stimulus from the dollar, real
exports of goods and services appear to have increased at an annual rate of 9 percent in
the fourth quarter; we expect them to continue to rise at around this pace in the current
quarter. This profile for exports is slightly stronger than in the December Tealbook,
reflecting the information in the recent monthly trade reports and the stronger indicators
lately for foreign real activity.
With imports falling and exports rising appreciably, we estimate that net exports
added 3½ percentage points to GDP growth during the final quarter of 2010, a
contribution 1¾ percentage points more positive than in the December Tealbook. For the

previous forecast. e

D
Prices and Wages n
o
c
Core inflation has remained low. The core PCE price index increased 0.1 percent E
c
i
in November after having been nearly unchanged over the preceding four months, and s t
e
m
our translation of the CPI and PPI data for December suggests that core PCE prices were
o
D
close to flat in that month as well. Based on these readings, we estimate that core PCE
prices rose at an annual rate of just 0.6 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole, held
down by a large decline in goods prices and softness in prices for a variety of market-
based services. We continue to think that part of the low rate of core inflation in late
2010 was transitory, and we expect it to pick up to nearly 1 percent in the current quarter
as higher import prices show through to goods prices and as prices of market-based
services return to a more normal rate of increase. Total PCE prices are projected to rise
at an annual rate of about 2 percent in both the fourth and first quarters, pushed up by
large increases in consumer energy prices.
Measures of long-term inflation expectations have not changed significantly of
late. Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Reuters/University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers for early January stood at 2.8 percent, the same as over
the preceding three months. Since the time of the December Tealbook, the TIPS-based
measure of five-year inflation compensation has risen 0.3 percentage point, likely pushed
higher by rising prices for oil and other commodities and by the firming of the economic
outlook, while the five-year forward measure has been about flat.
As we had expected, average hourly earnings rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in
the fourth quarter, consistent with our forecast for a 2 percent increase in hourly
compensation. Compensation growth is projected to move up to 2½ percent in the
current quarter as employers are required to raise their contributions to state
unemployment insurance funds. Given these compensation gains and our projections of
productivity growth, unit labor costs are expected to be little changed on net over the
fourth and first quarters.

u t THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
O
&
Our medium-term forecast is very similar to that in the December Tealbook, with
l
e
v
e real GDP projected to increase 3¾ percent in 2011 and 4½ percent in 2012. Nonetheless,
D
n the incoming data suggest that the level of activity at the end of 2010 was ¼ percentage
o
c
E point higher than we had anticipated, and we have nudged up our forecast for growth in
c
t i 2011 in response to the favorable recent news. As a result, the projected level of real
s
e
m GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 is somewhat higher than in our previous forecast, and
o
D
the unemployment rate—at 7¾ percent—is ¼ percentage point lower.
Our forecast continues to feature a steady acceleration of private demand that
more than offsets the waning of the impetus from federal fiscal policy. The strengthening
in private demand is expected to come about as the financial repair process proceeds,
credit availability improves further, and the adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth
lessen. A further recovery in the labor market should also help shore up household
confidence. However, some significant negatives, including importantly the high
vacancy rates for residential and commercial real estate and the budget problems of state
and local governments, are still weighing on the outlook. As a result, we continue to
project a recovery that is substantial, but less robust than those that have typically
followed deep U.S. recessions.
The projected gains in consumer spending reflect many of the same forces that we
anticipate will drive the broader economic recovery. In addition, PCE growth receives a
boost in 2011 from the one-year reduction in payroll taxes, though some of that boost is
reversed in 2012 when the tax cut expires. In all, we expect real PCE to rise 3½ percent
this year and 3¾ percent in 2012. Largely because spending is projected to respond
gradually to the extra disposable income generated by the payroll tax cut, the personal
saving rate is expected to move up to around 6 percent this year but then drop back to
5¼ percent in 2012, a shade below our current estimate for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Similarly, business outlays on equipment and software are projected to post solid
gains over the next two years as rising sales, improved business confidence, and greater
credit availability induce firms to replace aging capital and expand their capacity. In fact,
we have revised up our forecast in response to the faster growth in business output in the
near term and the additional tax incentive in 2012 that we brought into the forecast this
round. In all, we now expect real E&S outlays to increase 13½ percent in 2011 and

e
v
e Given the ongoing strengthening of foreign activity and a depreciating dollar, real
D
n exports of goods and services should also contribute importantly to domestic production;
o
c
E in our forecast, exports expand at an average annual rate of nearly 9 percent in 2011 and
c
i
t 2012. At the same time, real imports are projected to rise 6¼ percent on average, as the
s
e
m
pull of robust U.S. demand overcomes the drag from the depreciating dollar. In all, net
o
D
exports are expected to be a small positive for GDP growth over the projection period.
The construction sector is unlikely to provide much impetus to growth over the
next two years. In the December Tealbook, we significantly revised down our projection
for housing construction, and we have largely maintained that forecast here. As before,
we expect housing demand to firm a bit in coming quarters as the declines in house prices
taper off and prospects for jobs and incomes improve. But many households will likely
continue to find it difficult to finance home purchases, and the drag on homebuilding
from the overhang of distressed and vacant homes will probably lessen only slowly.
Thus, we project just a gradual resuscitation of new construction, with single-family
housing starts reaching an annual rate of 660,000 units by the end of 2012—more than
200,000 units higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010 but still well below the pace we
believe is consistent with the longer-run demand for housing. Nonresidential
construction is likely to remain depressed as well, constrained by high vacancy rates, low
prices for commercial real estate, and lending conditions that will likely be tight for some
time.
Government purchases are also projected to make only a very small contribution
to real GDP growth over the medium term. Reductions in spending related to overseas
military operations and the phasing out of stimulus-related nondefense spending are
expected to hold the increase in real federal expenditures to 1 percent this year and to
zero in 2012. In the state and local sector, tax collections seem to be picking up—albeit
from a very low level—and our forecast for economic activity implies significant further
increases in revenues over the next two years. But the cyclical increase in revenues will
be offset by the ending of federal stimulus grants, and thus real spending by these
jurisdictions is projected to rise just ¼ percent in 2011 and 1¼ percent in 2012.

Productivity and the Labor Market
As with our forecast of real activity, the forecast for the labor market is similar to
that in the December Tealbook. As before, the gap we estimate between actual labor
productivity and its structural level is projected to narrow over the medium term as firms
add workers to meet rising production needs and to relieve pressures on their existing
workforces. Thus, while we have trimmed our near-term forecast for private employment
a bit, we continue to project that employment growth will pick up noticeably over the
course of the projection period. In particular, we expect private job gains to average
roughly 270,000 per month in the second half of 2011 and 300,000 per month in 2012.
Consistent with this employment outlook, our forecast calls for actual labor productivity
to rise 1½ percent in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012, a little less than our estimate of its
structural growth rate.
The projected job gains in this forecast lead to a gradual reduction in the
unemployment rate over the next two years. Our forecast for the unemployment rate at
the end of 2011, at a little under 9 percent, is the same as in the previous Tealbook, as the
effect of the slightly stronger output growth in this forecast is offset by our revised
assumptions about the availability of benefits under the EUC program. The
unemployment rate is projected to move down steadily over the course of 2012, largely
because of the above-trend growth in GDP, but also reflecting the tapering off of
extended and emergency unemployment benefits; our projection for the unemployment
4 We did make a small adjustment to our estimate of the effective NAIRU, which includes the
influence of extended and emergency unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemployment rate
that we view as being consistent with no slack in the labor market. In particular, our revised assumptions
about the EUC program imply an upward revision of nearly 0.2 percentage point to our estimate of the
effective NAIRU by late 2011, but that effect largely disappears by the end of 2012. We still think the
effective NAIRU is in the neighborhood of 6½ percent at present and will decline to around 6 percent by
the end of 2012.

E remain so over the next two years; in particular, the level of real GDP is projected to still
c
i
s t be about 3¼ percent below the level of potential output at the end of 2012. Similarly, by
e
m
our reckoning, the unemployment rate will be 1¾ percentage points above the effective
o
D
NAIRU at the end of 2012, compared with an estimated unemployment gap of about
3 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2010. This extended period of labor market
slack is likely to be associated with other features of a weak labor market, including
below-trend labor force participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily
on part-time schedules, and an unusually large concentration of workers experiencing
long-duration unemployment spells.
The margin of unused plant capacity in the industrial sector should be taken up
more rapidly than the slack in the economy as whole, in part because manufacturing
capacity seems likely to expand slowly over the forecast period; indeed, we project that
manufacturing capacity will increase just 1 percent this year and 1½ percent in 2012. As
a result, by the end of 2012, our projection calls for the factory operating rate to be
around its long-run average despite the still-sizable GDP gap prevailing at that time.
Compensation and Prices
Given the high unemployment rates and low rates of price inflation in our
forecast, we expect labor costs to remain subdued over the projection period. In our
forecast, the Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation rises about
2 percent in 2011 and 2¼ percent in 2012, while the employment cost index increases at a
roughly similar rate. Combined with the moderate gains in productivity that we project,
these increases in compensation imply only a small rise in unit labor costs over the
medium term.
Prices of imported core goods (all goods excluding fuels, computers, and
semiconductors) appear to have increased at an annual rate of about 6 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2010, pushed up by higher commodity prices and dollar depreciation;
we expect them to increase at nearly this pace in the current quarter, as commodity prices
rise further and foreign inflation stays high. These near-term increases are somewhat

&
e l commodity prices level off and the effects of dollar depreciation wane.
v
e
D
n As discussed in the box “Pass-Through of Industrial Commodity Prices to Core
o
c
E Inflation,” we do not expect the run-up in industrial commodity prices to have much
c
i
t effect on domestic core inflation. Accordingly, even after taking on board the higher
s
e
m
prices for commodities, imports, and energy—as well as the slightly smaller margin of
o
D
resource slack—in this Tealbook, we have raised our forecast for core PCE inflation just
0.1 percentage point, to 1 percent in both 2011 and 2012. The basic story of our inflation
forecast is unchanged—namely, that while the substantial slack in resource utilization
will continue to exert downward pressure on inflation over the projection period, that
influence will be muted by the continuing stability of long-run inflation expectations.
Given our path for food and energy prices, total PCE inflation is expected to be a little
faster than core inflation in 2011 and in line with core in 2012.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff forecast to 2015 using the FRB/US model and staff
assessments of long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors. The
contour of the long-run outlook depends on the following key assumptions:
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run,
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by
FOMC participants at the November meeting.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities follow the baseline portfolio
projections reported in Book B. We assume that the projected decline in the
System’s holdings beginning in 2013 will contribute about 25 basis points to
the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the 2013–15 period.
 Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to
normal levels, and banks ease their lending standards somewhat further.
 The federal government budget deficit narrows to about 4½ percent of GDP
by the end of 2015. This improvement reflects the effects of the economic
recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy
actions after 2012 aimed at reducing the deficit.

 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate u
O
¾ percent per year in the 2013–15 period. The price of WTI crude oil edges &
up a bit after 2012 and reaches $98 per barrel by 2015, consistent with futures e l
v
e
prices. Under these assumptions, movements in the prices of energy and D
n
imports have only minor implications for domestic inflation in the extension. o

Foreign real GDP expands, on average, about 3¼ percent per year from 2013

e
m
o
 Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declines from 6 percent to 5¼ percent, D
as the functioning of the labor market improves. Potential GDP expands
3 percent per year on average.
The economy enters 2013 with the staff’s estimate of the output gap quite wide,
the unemployment rate well above the estimated NAIRU, and inflation very low. In the
long-run projection, improving confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and supportive
financial conditions eventually enable the level of aggregate demand to catch up with
aggregate supply and inflation to move closer to 2 percent. Specifically, real GDP rises
at an annual rate of 4½ percent in 2013 and 2014, considerably faster than its potential
pace; as a result, unemployment declines appreciably and inflation rises slowly. In
response, the federal funds rate begins to increase in the first quarter of 2013 and reaches
3½ percent by late 2014.5 By 2015, with improvements in confidence and financial
conditions largely complete, and with the federal funds rate climbing further to 4 percent,
gains in real GDP moderate. Nevertheless, overall economic growth remains robust
enough relative to potential to reduce the unemployment rate to the NAIRU by late 2015;
in addition, inflation continues to rise and reaches 1½ percent.
5 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the “outcome-based”
rule, described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

Pass-Through of Industrial Commodity Prices to Core Inflation
&
l
e
v
e Although prices for crude oil, natural gas, and farm commodities are important
D
determinants of consumer energy and food prices, prices for other industrial
n
o commodities typically have only a small effect on our projection of core inflation.
c
E Accordingly, even though core commodity prices have risen sharply over the past
c
i couple of years—in many cases rising above pre-crisis levels—we do not expect
t
s
e these price increases to significantly boost core inflation in the medium term.
m
o
D
Several factors account for the small estimated pass-through of commodity price
increases into core inflation. First, core industrial materials account for only a small
fraction—around 1 percent—of the overall cost of producing core consumer
goods and services. Roughly three-fourths of core consumer spending is on
services, which are not materials intensive. In addition, even for a good like an
automobile, the cost of iron, rubber, and glass is small compared with labor costs
and the cost of financing plant and equipment.
Moreover, the cost share of commodities—which we estimate using input-output
tables to compute the total amount of raw materials that is eventually needed to
produce a dollar of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—likely
overstates the medium-term effect of changes in materials prices on finished
goods prices. For example, part of the cost of producing air travel in the input-
output framework reflects the cost of the aluminum that is used to build the
airplanes that an airline uses. If the price of aluminum were to jump, we would
expect this cost increase to put upward pressure on the price of new airplanes and
eventually on airfares and core PCE prices. But this pass-through would be drawn
out over a long period of time, and would be attenuated in the short run to the
extent that aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or both allowed their price-cost
margins to absorb some of the cost increase and in the longer run to the extent
that aircraft manufacturers shifted to lower-cost production methods. Thus,
changes in raw material prices probably have a smaller effect on a given year’s
core inflation rate than a straight application of the cost share would imply.
As a result, even when commodity prices rise at double-digit rates, they tend to be
associated with much smaller changes in intermediate and final goods prices. The
upper panel of the figure on the facing page plots 12-month changes in the core
crude producer price index (PPI)—the black line—and the core intermediate PPI—
the red line—with the shaded areas indicating periods of significant core crude PPI
inflation (other broad-based indexes of core commodity prices move in a similar
manner). Changes in intermediate price inflation are much smaller than the swings
in crude price inflation; the echoes in core consumer price inflation—which is
plotted against core intermediate PPI inflation in the lower panel—are smaller still
(note the change in scale across the two panels).

Hence, given the size of the pass-through effect that we estimate, we expect that O
the commodity price increases that we have seen so far will add only a small &
l
amount to core inflation. However, a risk to our projection is that recent e
v
e
commodity price movements have been driven by upward revisions to expected D
future demand or prices. If these developments reflect either a stronger projected n

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Economic data that we have received since the previous Tealbook appear to
confirm a strengthening global recovery, though one that remains on two tracks. Much of
the current strength is centered in the emerging market economies (EMEs), where growth
is expected to remain robust over the forecast period. In contrast, we estimate that
fourth-quarter growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) stayed subdued.
However, as households and firms in the AFEs repair their balance sheets and labor
markets improve, the recovery in these countries seems poised to firm. That said,
k
developments in the euro-area periphery continue to pose a significant risk to the global o
o
l
t
outlook, with market participants increasingly expecting the Portuguese government to be u
O
forced to seek financial assistance. Assuming that the need for such measures does not &
l
spread beyond Portugal, with attendant spillovers to global financial markets, we expect e
v
e
that foreign GDP growth will rise from its 3 percent pace last quarter to more than D
n
3½ percent in 2012. This outlook is a little higher than in the December Tealbook, in part o
c
E
as recent data have been somewhat stronger than we had expected.
l
’
t
n
I
Foreign inflation rose to an estimated 5 percent in the fourth quarter, mostly
because of an acceleration of energy and food prices. (See the box “What Explains the
Recent Increase in Commodity Prices?” in the Domestic Economic Developments and
Outlook section.) The still-considerable economic slack in the AFEs should keep
inflation pressures contained, and we expect that AFE central banks will keep policy
accommodative over the forecast period. In contrast, inflation pressures appear to be
building in the EMEs. In response, a number of EME central banks have continued to
tighten policy and allowed some currency appreciation. We assume that policy will be
tightened further, although ongoing concerns about capital inflows will keep EMEs
cautious about raising rates.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
The step-down in growth in the AFEs in the summer persisted into the fourth
quarter, and we continue to project that economic growth will pick up only modestly over
the course of this year and next. Although prospects for manufacturing have improved
amid a resurgence in global trade, the outlook for activity more generally remains
relatively subdued. The outlook is especially damped in Europe, where domestic demand
will be restrained by heightened fiscal consolidation and continued financial stresses. We

have maintained the working hypothesis that the debt crisis in Europe will be contained
without significant disruptions to financial markets and economic activity outside the
peripheral economies. In our view, this outcome requires several actions by European
authorities. They will have to increase the funds available for financial assistance to
countries in distress. Also, they must take additional measures to shore up confidence in
the banking sector, including more-stringent stress tests where a number of banks are
required to raise additional capital. Further, the European Central Bank (ECB) needs to
continue to provide liquidity and purchase sovereign bonds.
Consumer prices in the AFEs accelerated markedly around year-end, driven by a
k
o run-up in food and energy prices. However, underlying inflationary pressures remain
o
l
t
u generally subdued amid considerable economic slack, so we anticipate that inflation will
O
& edge back down over the forecast period as increases in food and energy prices moderate.
l
e Although monetary policy in the major AFEs will remain accommodative over the
v
e
D forecast period, we now assume that central banks will begin tightening monetary policy
n
o sooner than in the December Tealbook.

n Euro Area
I
We estimate that real GDP growth in the euro area remained around 1½ percent at
an annual rate in the fourth quarter. Industrial production, manufacturing purchasing
managers indexes (PMIs), and industrial confidence showed considerable recent strength,
supported in part by a rebound in exports. However, this strength remains concentrated
in Germany and to a lesser extent in other core economies. Economic performance was
generally stagnant or declining in the euro-area periphery (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and
Spain). Moreover, the improved business conditions have not spilled over to the euro-
area household sector: Consumer confidence has softened, and retail sales have declined
sharply.
Recent data have led us to revise up our projection of euro-area growth in 2011 to
1¼ percent, but this is still slightly slower than in the second half of 2010, as the twin
headwinds of fiscal consolidation and financial turmoil more than offset support coming
from the depreciation of the euro. Euro-area GDP growth should then move up to
2¼ percent in 2012. We expect GDP in the euro-area periphery to stagnate in 2011 and
to lag growth in the rest of the euro area in 2012.

Market sentiment toward the euro-area periphery deteriorated through early
January on the expectation that increasing funding difficulties for Portugal’s government
and its banks would force the country to seek a rescue package from the European Union
(EU) and the International Monetary Fund. Sentiment recently has improved somewhat,
however, in part on news of the successful government debt auction in Portugal and on
reports that European officials were considering increasing the effective size and
widening the scope of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). Some EU
officials have proposed allowing the EFSF to buy sovereign bonds in the secondary
market (transferring these operations from the ECB) and to issue short-term lines of
credit to member countries facing liquidity difficulties, but German officials have voiced
k
o
reluctance to expand the EFSF’s current powers. o

O
Despite the ongoing tensions in the euro area, we now assume that the ECB will &
l
begin to raise its benchmark policy rate, currently at 1 percent, in the first quarter of e
v
e
2012. The ECB is concerned about recent increases in headline inflation, which rose to D
n
2.2 percent on a 12-month basis in December, above the ECB’s inflation target ceiling. o
c
E
This rise primarily reflects a jump in energy prices; although core inflation picked up a l
’
t
n
bit as well, it remained subdued at around 1 percent. We see headline inflation easing to I
around 1½ percent next year, as energy price inflation slows and economic slack erodes
only slowly. Although we now expect the ECB to kick off its policy rate hikes a bit
sooner, the ECB is likely to continue to provide ample liquidity to banks and purchase
peripheral sovereign bonds. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet alluded to this
possibility recently, making a strong distinction between macroeconomic policy and
liquidity policy.
Japan
After having risen at a pace of 5 percent over the previous year, Japanese real
GDP is estimated to have declined 1½ percent last quarter. Private consumption likely
contracted as a government subsidy for auto purchases expired, and exports appear to
have declined as well. But monthly data suggest that economic activity rebounded
toward year-end. Industrial production turned up in November, and manufacturers
reported plans to significantly increase production. Accordingly, we are projecting
1½ percent growth in the current quarter. Going forward, growth should pick up a bit
further, to 2 percent by 2012, supported by continued improvement in the labor market,
no significant tightening in fiscal policy, and a little further easing by the Bank of
Japan (BOJ).

The Cost of Deflation: The Japanese Experience
After four decades of strong growth, the Japanese economy slowed sharply in the early
1990s and stagnated thereafter. The post-1980s period also coincided with falling
inflation and later deflation, raising questions about the effect of disinflation and outright
deflation on Japanese activity. To address this issue, we focused on three transmission
channels: debt deflation, downward nominal wage rigidity, and the zero lower bound
(ZLB) on nominal interest rates.
In the debt deflation channel, unanticipated declines in inflation or the price level boost
the real value of fixed-interest-rate debt, thereby redistributing wealth from borrowers
to lenders. To estimate the effect of debt deflation on economic activity in Japan, we use
k
o actual and expected inflation rates over the past two decades (see figure below) to
o
l compute a sequence of inflation surprises and apply the results to our estimates of the
t
O u stock of Japanese debt with fixed interest rates.1 Although private nonfinancial sector
& debt in Japan is large, fixed-rate debt is composed primarily of a subset of household
l mortgage debt amounting to only 20 percent of disposable income. As a consequence,
e
v we find that the increase in real debt due to unexpected disinflation averaged less than
e
D 1 percent of household disposable income per year. Assuming a standard marginal
n propensity to consume out of wealth (5 percent), and even without factoring in any rise
o
c in consumption by now-wealthier creditors, these unanticipated increases in real debt
E
l likely exerted a negligible drag on consumption and thus on real GDP growth.
’
t
n
I
Downward nominal wage rigidities are another channel through which deflation might be
costly. With sufficient inflation, firms needing to cut costs in real terms may simply slow
the growth of nominal wages, but with low-to-negative inflation, cuts in nominal wages
are required. If workers resist such cuts, firms may be forced to scale back production.
Akerlof and others estimate that, for the United States, reducing annual (steady-state)
nominal wage growth from 4 percent to 1 percent, as occurred in Japan during the first
half of the 1990s (shown in the figure below), would lower annual output growth 0.1 to
1
The effects of inflation surprises on loans with variable rates should be negligible because these
rates adjust more freely to movements in inflation.

0.2 percentage point.2 A further drop in wage growth to negative 1 percent, similar to
Japan’s wage deflation by the turn of 2000, would depress GDP growth as much as
¾ percentage point per year. However, this latter estimate is generally viewed as being
an upper bound. Moreover, Japanese microdata indicate that wages became more
flexible as disinflation proceeded, and the Japanese unemployment rate did not surge to
the extent predicted by the Akerlof model.3 All told, our assessment is that downward
wage rigidity is unlikely to have held down Japanese GDP growth by more than 0.1 or
0.2 percentage point per year.
A third way deflation may affect activity is by constraining the exercise of monetary
policy through conventional means. When inflation rates, and thus interest rates, are
very low, monetary policy may be limited by the ZLB, potentially leading to undesirably
high real interest rates that would hinder the return to full employment. To assess this
k
channel, we use the SIGMA model to simulate the course that the Japanese economy o
o
would have taken had the ZLB not been binding. The Asian crisis in 1998, the high-tech t l
u
recession in 2001, and the global financial crisis in 2008 all pushed the counterfactual O
policy rate below zero (see lower-left panel). Accordingly, our admittedly uncertain &
calculations suggest that since 1998, average annual GDP growth has been depressed e l
v
0.4 percentage point due to the presence of the ZLB, for a cumulative output loss of e
D
4½ percent (see lower-right panel). Our simulations do not explicitly account for the
n
Bank of Japan’s 2001–06 quantitative easing program, but most observers believe that o
c
this program provided at most a very partial offset. E
l
’
t
n
Pulling together the different strands, we conclude that low or negative inflation may I
have shaved up to about ⅓ percentage point off of average annual Japanese growth over
the past 20 years, with the bulk of the effects being attributed to the ZLB since 1998. This
annual reduction implies a level of Japanese GDP that is as much as 5 to 7 percent lower
than it would be otherwise.

November’s report of 12-month headline inflation remained slightly positive.
However, core inflation, excluding energy and food prices, continued to linger near
negative 1 percent amid considerable economic slack. Accordingly, with energy prices
leveling out, headline deflation is set to reemerge in early 2011 and to persist over the
forecast period, leading the BOJ to moderately step up its asset purchases. Japan’s
experience with deflation over the past two decades is examined in the box “The Cost of
Deflation: The Japanese Experience.”
Canada
k We estimate that real GDP growth, having slowed considerably in the third
o
o
quarter, moved back up to 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter, supported by a stronger-than-
l
t
u
O expected rebound in exports. Economic activity should continue to expand at that pace in
&
2011 and 2012, supported by solid growth in domestic demand, even as the strength of
l
e
v
e the Canadian dollar leads to some drag from net exports. The withdrawal of fiscal
D
stimulus should restrain demand, but investment is set to remain strong, as firms enjoy
n
o
c low borrowing costs, abundant cash, and cheap imported machinery and equipment.
E
l
t ’ Rising fuel prices have boosted headline inflation, which we expect to peak at 2½ percent
n
I
on a 12-month basis around midyear before moderating to near the 2 percent target. Both
our GDP growth and inflation paths are higher in the near term than in the previous
Tealbook, leading us to bring forward our assumption of the Bank of Canada’s next rate
hike to the fourth quarter of 2011.
United Kingdom
We estimate that real GDP in the United Kingdom rose 2 percent in the fourth
quarter, with only a limited pulling forward of consumption in advance of January’s
value-added tax hike. As fiscal consolidation increasingly bites, restraining improvement
in private activity, output growth should remain at around 2 percent in 2011. Growth
should increase to around 2½ percent by 2012, helped by fading effects from financial
stresses and continued support from a weak pound. December’s reading on 12-month
CPI inflation, at 3.7 percent, stood well above the 2 percent target, reflecting tax
increases, the pickup in food and energy prices, and higher import prices. Given our
higher inflation path, we have brought the first rate hike by the Bank of England forward
to the first quarter of 2012. However, policy will remain accommodative in the face of
the many factors weighing on growth and amid expectations that the surge in inflation
will prove transitory.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
We now estimate that real GDP growth in the EMEs rebounded to 5 percent in the
fourth quarter. This performance is up ¾ percentage point from the December Tealbook,
in part reflecting an upward spike in Singapore’s growth, although recent widespread
increases in exports and manufacturing PMIs point to resurgent growth for the
developing world as a whole. Growth is expected to remain robust this year and next—at
around 5 percent—as activity firms in the advanced economies and domestic demand in
the EMEs stays strong. Our outlook for 2011 and 2012 has been revised up slightly, as
global commodity prices and domestic indicators suggest more vigor in EME activity
k
than we had previously expected. o
o
l
t
u
O
Inflation has picked up in the EMEs. Although the increase largely reflects
&
accelerating food prices, several countries, including China, show signs of more l
e
v
widespread inflationary pressures. Despite increases in policy rates in several countries, e
D
the level of policy rates in EMEs overall is still low by historical standards and perhaps n
o
c
lower than the cyclical positions of these economies would warrant. Monetary E
l
’
t
authorities in EMEs continued to show some reluctance to raise policy rates out of n
I
concerns that such moves could encourage further capital inflows and generate upward
pressures on currencies. Even though currency appreciation would help moderate
inflation, authorities in several countries sought to limit upward pressures on their
currencies by imposing new capital controls, intervening in currency markets, or both.
China
Recent data suggest that the Chinese economy continued to expand at a robust
9 percent pace in the fourth quarter, slightly higher than our expectations. Industrial
production rose briskly through November, and surveys indicate this rise extended into
December. November nominal retail sales and fixed-asset investment remained more
than 20 percent above their year-earlier levels. We continue to project that Chinese
authorities will be successful in engineering a soft landing, with economic growth of
around 8½ percent this year and next—near its potential rate.
Headline consumer price inflation jumped in November, to more than 5 percent
on a 12-month basis. Food price inflation continued to be the largest contributor to the
increase, but nonfood inflation also rose to nearly 2 percent from 1½ percent in October.
In response, Chinese authorities have further tightened policy over the intermeeting
period, raising the one-year bank lending rate 25 basis points and hiking required reserve

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 19, 2011
ratios for large banks 100 basis points to 19 percent. In addition, authorities have been
clamping down on credit growth, and we expect this tightening to continue. The Chinese
government also has allowed somewhat more appreciation of the renminbi against the
dollar in recent weeks, even as reserves continued to accumulate rapidly. Since last June,
when the authorities announced greater exchange rate flexibility, the renminbi has risen
3½ percent against the dollar but has been roughly flat on a real trade-weighted basis. As
in the previous Tealbook, we project the renminbi to appreciate 4 percent against the
dollar this year and 6 percent in 2012 as part of China’s efforts toward gradual
rebalancing of its economy.

o
o Other Emerging Asia
l
t
u Incoming data indicate that economic activity in the rest of emerging Asia
O
& rebounded in the fourth quarter, in line with the stronger pace of activity in China.

e

production growth was generally positive.

c
E
The pickup in activity across the region has been accompanied by a somewhat
l
’
t
n
greater rise in inflation in the fourth quarter than we had previously anticipated, driven by
I
the pickup in food and global commodity prices. In response, Korea and Taiwan, among
others, have tightened monetary policy further and have also taken some measures to
slow capital inflows and limit upward pressures on their currencies. We continue to
assume that Asian policymakers will allow some moderate further currency appreciation
this year and next, in line with projected movements in the renminbi.
Latin America
After slowing sharply in the third quarter of last year, real GDP growth in Latin
America is estimated to have picked up only slightly in the fourth quarter, to 3 percent.
We expect growth in the region to rise to 4¼ percent by next quarter and then remain at
that pace through the rest of the forecast period. In Mexico, we estimate that real GDP
grew 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter. Industrial production declined slightly in October
and November, but exports and retail sales continued to expand. We anticipate that
Mexican growth will increase to 4¼ percent in the second half of 2011 and in 2012,
driven in part by the recovery in U.S. demand. Food prices have been boosting Mexican
inflation; we project inflation there will rise to an annual rate of 5½ percent in the current
quarter before edging below 4 percent, the upper end of the government’s target range of
2 to 4 percent, by the end of the forecast period.

We estimate that Brazilian growth moved up to 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter,
boosted by strength in commodity markets, lax fiscal policies, and rapid credit growth.
GDP growth will likely remain in that vicinity over the forecast period. Headline
inflation (on a 12-month basis) rose to around 6 percent at the end of 2010, fueled by
both robust aggregate demand and rising food prices. In response to strong growth and
rising inflation, the incoming Dilma Rousseff government has pledged to tighten fiscal
policies, and Alexandre Tombini, the new central bank president, has made it clear that
fighting inflationary pressures will remain a high priority. At the same time, Brazilian
authorities continued to take measures in an attempt to limit upward pressures on the
real, including the introduction in January of a 60 percent unremunerated reserve
k
o
requirement on banks’ short dollar positions. o

Financial Developments
Financial conditions improved modestly over the intermeeting period, reflecting a
sense that the economic recovery was firming. Broad stock price indexes extended their
stretch of strong gains, and risk spreads on corporate bonds narrowed somewhat. Both
short- and longer-term nominal Treasury rates were relatively little changed, on net, over
the period. TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years
increased, but they were about unchanged for the period 5 to 10 years ahead. Short-term
funding conditions remained stable, and the year-end passed without any significant or
unexpected strains. Over the intermeeting period, the broad nominal value of the U.S.
dollar declined more than 1 percent, partly reflecting more-solid growth prospects
abroad, particularly in emerging market economies (EMEs), along with actual and
prospective tightening of foreign monetary policies. However, the dollar was little
changed against the euro amid the continued strains in the euro area.
The latest indicators of business credit quality showed further improvement, while
those for consumer credit quality generally confirmed the improvements seen earlier in
the year. However, the commercial and residential real estate segments have continued
to lag. Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations remained robust in December, and
s
issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) picked up in the fourth t

TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS
Money market futures rates and Treasury yields were somewhat volatile at times
but were relatively little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. Both the
December FOMC statement and the minutes of the December meeting were largely in
line with market expectations and elicited limited price action.1 Nonetheless, the
statement in the minutes indicating that some FOMC members had a “fairly high
threshold for making changes to the [Treasury purchase] program” reportedly made
investors more confident that the FOMC’s purchases would total $600 billion.2 Data
releases over the intermeeting period generally pointed to some firming of the economic
recovery. However, upward pressure on yields reportedly was moderated by
expectations of only a gradual pace of improvement in the labor market, the Federal
Reserve’s commitment to maintain an accommodative policy stance, and ongoing
concerns about fiscal and banking pressures in the euro area.
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years rose 29 basis points to
a little more than 2 percent, likely pushed higher by rising prices for oil and other
commodities and by the firming of the economic outlook. In addition, estimated
probabilities of deflation during the next four years measured from TIPS continued to
decline over the intermeeting period and now stand around 7 percent. Further out, TIPS-
s based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed at about 3 percent.

2 The Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York purchased $117.8 billion of
Treasury securities over the period, reflecting purchases under the new asset purchase program and
reinvestment of principal payments on Federal Reserve holdings of agency MBS and agency debt. After
the Desk announced in November that it would temporarily relax its 35 percent per-issue limit, it
announced on December 20 that it would limit its holdings of any single Treasury security in the SOMA
portfolio to 70 percent of the outstanding issue. The Desk indicated that it would purchase individual
securities in progressively smaller increments as the SOMA holdings of such securities increased above the
35 percent threshold. In addition, on January 12, the Desk announced that it would increase its purchases
of longer-term Treasury securities (excluding reinvestments of repayments of principal on agency debt and
mortgage-backed securities) to $80 billion over the period between mid-January and mid-February,
consistent with the monthly pace needed to reach $600 billion of cumulative purchases by the end of June.
There was no market reaction to that announcement.

The Desk’s continuing purchases of longer-term Treasury securities reportedly
had no discernible effects on Treasury market functioning. Thin trading volumes ahead
of year-end and perhaps some flows related to hedging of mortgage convexity appear to
have contributed to elevated volatility in Treasury yields during the early part of the
intermeeting period. More recently, market-based measures of uncertainty about longer-
term Treasury yields declined and ended the period slightly lower, on net, likely
reflecting in part solidifying market expectations regarding the ultimate size of the
FOMC’s asset purchase program. Uncertainty about the future path of the federal funds
rate, measured from Eurodollar implied volatilities, also edged down on balance.
Neither the expected nor the modal path of the federal funds rate changed
appreciably over the intermeeting period. Futures quotes, combined with the staff’s
standard assumption about term premiums, indicate that market participants expect the
federal funds rate to rise above the current target range in the first quarter of 2012 and to
reach 1 percent by the end of 2012. The distribution of futures rates remains highly
skewed to the right, with quotes on interest rate caps continuing to suggest that the modal
expected federal funds rate does not rise above the current target range until the end of
2012.
The Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also suggested that market
s participants’ expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed since
t

spread between the staff’s estimate of the expected real equity return for S&P 500 firms
and an estimate of the real 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity risk premium—
narrowed further over the period but remained elevated by historical standards.
Yields on BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined about
5 basis points and 24 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, and their
spreads over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed a bit more.
Near-term corporate-bond forward spreads declined, suggesting that investors are pricing
in somewhat less default risk in the near term, and far-term forward spreads—a rough
gauge of required compensation for risk-taking—also inched lower. Meanwhile, the
average bid price in the secondary market for leveraged loans moved up to about
95 percent of par, continuing its climb from a low of 60 percent in early 2009 and
recording its highest reading since November 2007.
Conversations with market participants indicate that the modestly rising trend in
the use of dealer-intermediated leverage has continued into 2011, but a variety of
indicators suggest that leverage remains well below the levels reached before the crisis.
Hedge funds that focus on long-short equity strategies appeared to be a little more willing
to take on risk during early January. By contrast, risk appetite at macro hedge funds has
reportedly remained muted. Overall, the performance of hedge funds improved
s significantly during the final months of 2010, bringing the average return for hedge funds

sentiment toward banks continued to be influenced by developments related to the
potential for significant put-backs of mortgages from MBS pools and to mortgage
documentation and foreclosure issues. An announcement by Bank of America that it had
reached an agreement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to resolve repurchase claims on
residential mortgages sold to the GSEs was well received by market participants. A

ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that voided two foreclosure sales by
Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp is unlikely to have broader implications, but it highlighted
the continuing legal uncertainties around foreclosures. Also of note, a number of smaller
financial institutions fully repaid TARP funds toward the end of 2010, and AIG
completed a recapitalization plan that allowed it to repay $46 billion of Federal Reserve
support (see the box “Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period”).
BUSINESS FINANCE
Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was robust in the fourth
quarter. Net issuance of bonds was particularly strong, supported by heavy issuance in
both the speculative- and investment-grade sectors. Meanwhile, nonfinancial commercial
paper outstanding decreased slightly over the quarter, but C&I loans posted a small gain,
reflecting increases at many of the 25 largest banks in December. The SLOOS conducted
in January indicated that demand for C&I loans had increased somewhat in the fourth
quarter, especially for large and middle-market firms. As in recent surveys, a modest
fraction of banks, on net, had eased standards on C&I loans somewhat, and a large
fraction had reduced spreads on such loans. Other data showed that issuance of
leveraged syndicated loans—especially those funded by institutional investors such as
loan mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds—has been
robust in recent months. Although market participants reported that deal terms (including
s
t
n
leverage) loosened a bit further, they emphasized that some of the riskier features and e
m
structures that were fairly widespread at the height of the credit boom in 2006−07 have so p
o
l
e
far remained uncommon. v
e
D
l
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms dropped back in December to a
i
c
n
its average pace in 2010, following the bump-up in November that resulted from GM’s a
n
i
initial public offering. In the third quarter, equity retirements from share repurchases and F
cash-financed mergers continued apace, leaving net equity issuance slightly more
negative. Incoming data on cash-financed mergers and on announcements of new share
repurchase programs suggest a continued rapid pace of equity retirements in the fourth
quarter.
The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season commenced just before the close of
the intermeeting period, with the first wave of reports beating analysts’ expectations by a
wide margin. Based on about 50 reports in hand and using analyst estimates for the rest,
the staff expects operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms to post another solid

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
The total size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet advanced to just above $2.4 trillion
over the intermeeting period (see table on facing page). The Federal Open Market
Committee’s (FOMC) asset purchase program boosted securities holdings by $73 billion,
while the closure of American International Group’s (AIG) recapitalization plan reduced
support for specific institutions by $46 billion. On net, Federal Reserve assets increased
by $30 billion.
The Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) conducted
21 operations to purchase longer‐term Treasury securities over the intermeeting period.
There were operations across the nominal yield curve as well as 3 operations in Treasury
inflation‐protected securities (TIPS); purchases over the intermeeting period totaled
$119 billion, and $118 billion in purchases settled during the period.1 The Desk has
temporarily relaxed its 35 percent per issue limit on System Open Market Account
(SOMA) holdings of individual Treasury issues; the limit is now 70 percent. As of January
12, 2011, SOMA holdings of 28 issues with total par value of $178 billion exceeded
35 percent. The SOMA’s largest ownership concentration is currently 57 percent;
holdings of four issues with total par value of $21 billion now exceed 50 percent. Holdings
of agency debt and mortgage‐backed securities (MBS) declined by $44 billion over the
intermeeting period; consistent with the FOMC’s directive, these declines were offset by
purchases of Treasury securities.2
On January 14, 2011, AIG repaid the credit extended by the Federal Reserve under the
s revolving credit line, and the Federal Reserve was paid in full for its preferred interests in
t
n
e the special purpose vehicles (SPVs) AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC, thereby
m
reducing the balances in these accounts to zero.
p
o
l
e
v These transactions involved several steps. First, AIG repaid the balance on the revolving
e
D credit facility and redeemed a portion of the Federal Reserve’s preferred interests in the
l
a SPVs with cash proceeds from asset dispositions. These cash proceeds had been held by
i
c
n the FRBNY as agent and are shown in the table as the liability item “Funds from AIG asset
a
n dispositions, held as agent”; as a result of this transaction, this item declined by
i
F
$27 billion. Second, AIG purchased the remaining preferred interests in the SPVs from the
FRBNY through a draw on the Treasury’s Series F preferred stock commitment, a
component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and transferred the SPV preferred
interests to the Treasury as consideration for the draw on the available Series F funds.

These figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that settled over the intermeeting period.
During this time, $7.8 billion in coupon purchases conducted earlier settled, and the Open Market Desk
committed to purchase, but had not settled, $9.5 billion in TIPS and coupon purchases.
2
On January 10, 2011, the FRBNY announced that it will begin a process to streamline the
administration of SOMA agency MBS holdings by consolidating these securities through a service
offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac called CUSIP aggregation. Through this process, aggregated
CUSIPs are formed by consolidating existing agency MBS with similar characteristics into larger pass‐
through securities. This process will reduce the number of CUSIPs held in the SOMA portfolio from over
44,000 to about 10,000.

Overall, the Federal Reserve’s direct exposure to AIG, which peaked at $91 billion, now
has dropped to zero. The Federal Reserve continues to have exposure to the assets
acquired from AIG that are held in Maiden Lane II LLC and Maiden Lane III LLC. The
balance on Federal Reserve loans to these entities, including accrued interest, currently
stands at $26 billion; the combined fair value of the assets held in Maiden Lane II and
Maiden Lane III is about $38 billion.3 With the Treasury’s investment in AIG at about
$68 billion, the combined value of the Treasury’s investments in AIG and the balance on
the Federal Reserve’s loans to Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III now stands at
$94 billion. Total support provided to AIG by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve
peaked at $136 billion in April 2009.
Other notable movements on the liability side of the balance sheet were in the Treasury’s
general account and term deposits. The Treasury’s general account increased $69 billion,
on net, over the intermeeting period, reflecting typical fluctuations in that account. Term
deposits declined by $5 billion, to zero, as the small‐scale real‐value Term Deposit Facility
operation conducted on November 29, 2010, matured on December 30, 2010.

gain in operating earnings per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Preliminary data
indicate that revisions to analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms
have been positive, on balance, since mid-December.
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to improve. The ratio of liquid
assets to total assets for nonfinancial corporations stayed at record highs in the third
quarter, while the sector’s debt-to-asset ratio declined a bit further. Upgrades by
Moody’s Investors Service on nonfinancial corporate bonds again outpaced downgrades
in the fourth quarter, and the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms
remained very low in December. The expected default rate for nonfinancial firms from
Moody’s KMV declined somewhat in December, in part reflecting higher stock prices.
In contrast, delinquency rates for broad categories of commercial real estate have
not improved, and financing conditions have remained tight for most types of commercial
real estate. That said, credit appears to have become somewhat less restricted for larger
properties in strong markets. Issuance of CMBS, which are generally used to finance
such properties, is scheduled in the first quarter of 2011 to exceed the entire amount
issued in 2010. However, it remains a fraction of its pre-crisis levels. In addition,
commercial mortgage CDS index prices for AAA-rated securities have continued to trend
up in recent weeks, likely reflecting a greater willingness of investors to take on risk in
s order to boost returns as well as greater clarity regarding the likely magnitude of losses
t
n
e
m on the structured securities. Prices of larger properties in strong markets have moved up,

House prices continued to be weighed down by the large inventory of unsold

index from CoreLogic, house prices fell in November for the sixth consecutive month,
leaving the index down 7 percent since May and 2½ percent below its previous trough in

April 2009. An increase in sales of distressed properties likely put additional downward
pressure on house prices. Overall mortgage debt declined further in the third quarter, and
with the housing market still weak and lending standards remaining tight, the staff
projects that it contracted further in the fourth quarter.
Serious delinquency rates on prime and subprime mortgages—meaning the
fraction of mortgage loans that are at least 90 days delinquent and loans in the foreclosure
process—flattened out in October and November after having moved down earlier in the
year. The foreclosure moratoriums instituted by a number of mortgage servicers in the
fall of 2010 may have lifted delinquency rates more recently by delaying completion of
foreclosures. (Once a foreclosure is completed, the mortgage is extinguished and is thus
no longer delinquent.) The fraction of loans transitioning from current to delinquent—a
measure not influenced by foreclosure moratoriums—continued to trend down through
November. Issues surrounding mortgage foreclosure and documentation issues appear to
have had little effect, to date, on house prices and mortgage financing activity.
Signs of improvement have been more evident in recent months in the consumer
credit market than in the residential mortgage market. Consumer credit is estimated to
have edged up in the fourth quarter, the first increase since the third quarter of 2008. In
addition, delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans declined for most of 2010 and
s continue to trend toward their longer-run norms. Meanwhile, the number of credit card
t
n
e
m offers mailed to households moved up considerably over the course of 2010, although in
p
o November solicitations remained lower than the level that prevailed from 2002 to 2006.

4 The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the FDIC resolution
authority over systemically important nonbank institutions. Investors are worried that the FDIC might
repudiate securitization contracts in the event of the bankruptcy of such an institution. On January 14, the
FDIC issued a General Council Letter clarifying that it would exercise its repudiation power under the
Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of the Dodd–Frank Act consistent with the U.S. bankruptcy code
or other applicable insolvency laws, including those governing legal isolation. The letter reportedly
reassured market participants, and issuance is expected to pick up again.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Over the intermeeting period, euro-area authorities continued to grapple with the
ongoing fiscal and financial strains in the euro-area periphery. Meanwhile, policymakers
in emerging market economies took steps to address a number of challenges posed by
rapid economic growth, including rising inflation and appreciating currencies.
The broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined 1¼ percent over the period.
The dollar depreciated against many EME currencies, largely reflecting buoyant EME
economic growth and tighter monetary policies in those economies. In addition,
expectations for somewhat earlier policy tightening in the advanced foreign economies
weighed on the dollar’s value against the major currencies late in the period. However,
the dollar was little changed against the euro, on net, amid the continued strains in the
euro area.
Greek, Irish, and Portuguese sovereign debt spreads over German bunds rose
modestly in December and early January, as credit rating agencies downgraded the credit
ratings on the sovereign debt of Ireland and Portugal. Recently, though, spreads
narrowed in response to several relatively successful sovereign debt auctions by countries
in the euro-area periphery, stepped-up purchases of their sovereign bonds by the ECB,
and reports that the EU is considering expanding the backstop capacity of the European
s
t
Financial Stability Facility. Overnight and term lending from the Eurosystem to banks in n
e
m
the periphery increased over the period. Some modest dollar-funding pressures p
o
developed as the year-end approached, but they did not persist into January. Market e l
v
e
participants welcomed the extension through August 1, 2011, of the Federal Reserve’s D
l
swap arrangements with the ECB and the central banks of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, a
i
c
n
and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Bank of England established a temporary a
n
i
liquidity swap facility with the ECB that is designed to provide Ireland’s central bank F
with sterling to help meet the potential needs of the Irish banking system.
Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields increased about 10 basis points in the United
Kingdom and in Germany, and measures of inflation compensation at the 10-year
maturity increased 10 to 20 basis points in these countries. Market-based readings on
expectations of future short-term rates moved up in the euro area, the United Kingdom,
and Canada on rising inflationary pressures and indications of firming economic activity.

Equity prices rose in advanced foreign economies and in most EMEs as the global
economic outlook improved over the period. In contrast, the Shanghai Composite index
declined 7½ percent, on net, likely in reaction to continued tightening by the People’s
Bank of China, which increased its one-year benchmark lending and deposit rates for the
second time in two months and again raised reserve requirements to curb bank lending.
Market participants expect further rounds of tightening in China. The central banks of
Chile, Hungary, Peru, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand also tightened policy
over the intermeeting period in response to rising inflationary pressures.
Most emerging market currencies continued to rise against the U.S. dollar,
spurred by monetary policy tightening in many EMEs, by favorable EME economic
growth rates, and by rising commodities prices. A number of governments took actions
to counter currency appreciation. For example, the central bank of Chile announced that
it will begin buying $12 billion against Chilean pesos to stem the rise of the peso.
Building on earlier moves to discourage capital inflows, the central bank of Brazil
announced it would impose a reserve requirement on banks’ short positions in the U.S.
dollar against the Brazilian real. The Chilean peso and Brazilian real depreciated sharply
following these announcements, although, over the period as a whole, the real is up
1 percent against the dollar. Central banks in Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand are also
believed to have intervened in the foreign exchange market in recent weeks.

During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned $165 billion of nominal e l

coupon securities across the maturity spectrum. Offer amounts were in line with previous D

$14.29 trillion (see the box “Debt Subject to Limit”).
Concerns about the credit quality of municipal bonds were heightened early in the
intermeeting period but eased somewhat after Illinois lawmakers substantially raised the
state’s personal and corporate income tax rates. Spreads on credit default swaps for the
bonds of some major states rose appreciably around year-end but generally have retraced
a significant portion of those increases more recently. Despite these improvements, the
municipal bond market appeared to continue to price in significantly higher default risk
than normal. The ratios of yields on long-term general obligation bonds to those on

Debt Subject to Limit
The level of public debt outstanding that is subject to the federal debt limit is approaching
the statutory ceiling of $14.294 trillion set by the Congress in February 2010. As of December
31, 2010, debt subject to limit was $13.973 trillion.
An increase in the debt limit requires an act of the Congress. On January 6, 2011, Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner made a formal request to the Congress that it raise the debt limit
by the end of the first quarter. Under our baseline forecast, federal debt will reach the debt
limit by mid‐April 2011. Our baseline forecast is consistent with the Tealbook projection for
government spending, debt issuance, and Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) bill
issuance. As a result of the minimal room currently left under the ceiling, the baseline
forecast assumes that new issuance of SFP bills ceases in early February and the
Supplementary Financing Account (SFA) balance falls to $5 billion by the end of March.1 The
draining of the SFA is consistent with the actions of the Treasury during the fall of 2009,
which is the last time Treasury debt outstanding approached the debt limit.

Should the Congress fail to raise the debt limit, the Treasury has a toolkit of possible

1
At the request of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department initiated the SFP in September 2008.
It consists of a series of Treasury bill auctions, with the proceeds of these auctions maintained in the SFA
held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The transfer of funds into this account acts to drain reserves
from the banking system, thereby offsetting some of the reserve effect of the Federal Reserve’s balance
sheet expansion. SFP bills are counted as marketable debt and are included in debt subject to limit.

include redeeming or suspending investment in selected nonmarketable debt series and
issuing a small amount of debt that is not subject to limit. Specifically, as shown in the table
below, we estimate that these tools could provide an estimated $178 billion of “headroom”
under the ceiling, and, as shown in the figure on the facing page, could be used, as needed,
to delay the date at which the debt limit is breached until the end of June 2011. The specific
tools available to the Treasury include2
 suspending daily reinvestment in the Government Securities Investment Fund
(G Fund), a retirement fund that invests in nonmarketable Treasury securities. The
Treasury has statutory authority to suspend daily reinvestment if it cannot be fully
invested without exceeding the debt limit. The G Fund has $125 billion available.
 redeeming existing and suspending new investments in the Civil Service Retirement
and Disability Fund (CSRDF), a trust fund that invests in nonmarketable Treasury
securities. The Treasury has statutory authority to redeem and suspend investments
if and when a “Debt Issuance Suspension Period” (DISP) exists. In line with past
episodes, we assume a four‐month DISP and available funds averaging $7 billion per
month.
 disinvesting the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), which is used to purchase or sell
foreign currencies. The dollar‐denominated holdings of the ESF are invested in
nonmarketable Treasury securities and the entire balance matures daily. While
statutory authority to invest these balances exists, the investments are not required
by the statute. As of December, the ESF balance was $20 billion.
 issuing Federal Financing Bank (FFB) debt, which is not subject to the debt limit, but
is capped at $15 billion. Currently, because $10 billion of FFB debt is outstanding,
only $5 billion is available.

The current set of tools and their nominal level are in line with past episodes.3 However, if a n a
i
breach appeared imminent, the tools would be used on an as‐needed basis, and if the debt F
limit were to be raised in a timely manner after the debt limit was reached, only minimal use
of the tools might be necessary. In previous debt limit episodes, the actual use of the tools
ranged from approximately $30 billion to about $60 billion.
2
In past debt limit episodes, one of the first actions the Treasury took was to suspend the issuance of
State and Local Government Series (SLGS) securities. However, because the benefit of suspending SLGS
securities issuance is only to give the Treasury more certainty over debt flows, and because any SLGS
securities not issued will likely have to be made up by issuing additional marketable debt to replace the
incoming cash, we do not include suspending SLGS securities in our analysis.
3
The Treasury also has various assets it could sell to raise funds in a debt limit crisis, including equity
stakes in selected private companies as well as $155.7 billion in holdings of agency mortgage‐backed
securities. Presumably, however, the Treasury would resort to such sales only after other funding and debt
management tools had been exhausted.

comparable-maturity Treasury securities and to those on AAA-rated corporate bonds
moved up to a very high level. Moreover, long-term tax-exempt bond funds experienced
significant outflows over the past two months, though tax-exempt money market mutual
funds experienced modest net inflows.
Despite these strains, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained
strong in December. New capital issuance continued to be robust, though its strength was
largely driven by a rush to issue Build America Bonds before the program expired at the
end of 2010. By contrast, refunding issuance slowed noticeably, hindered by higher
interest rates, and the pace of short-term issuance was slow.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
Bank credit fell at an annual rate of about 4¼ percent in December, its weakest
monthly reading since June as banks reduced their holdings of securities. Core loans on
banks’ books edged down again last month, but the rate of contraction still appears to be
abating. Indeed, after having been little changed, on balance, since the summer, C&I
loans expanded at a 7¼ percent pace in December. Despite continued weakness in many
residential real estate indicators, closed-end residential mortgage loans held by banks rose
moderately for the fifth consecutive month and registered the first quarterly gain since the
first quarter of 2008.5 Although the increase was concentrated at a few large banks,
s
t
n
results from a special question included in the most recent SLOOS suggest that the gains
e
m
p may persist: The fraction of banks that attributed the recent rise in such loans on their
o
l
e books to their greater willingness to accommodate those increases was noticeably larger
v
e
D than the fraction that attributed the rise to transitory factors. By contrast, commercial real
l
a
i estate loans and home equity loans continued to contract in December. Consumer loans
c
n
a also decreased last month, as credit card loans dropped further while other consumer
n
i
F loans rose only modestly.
The behavior of the components of core loans in recent months is broadly
consistent with the results of the January SLOOS. The survey responses indicate that,
during the fourth quarter of 2010, modest net fractions of banks continued to ease
5 According to flow of funds estimates, at the end of the third quarter, commercial banks held
approximately one-fifth of outstanding home mortgages, and so the estimated increases in the portfolios of
commercial banks do not imply growth in total mortgage debt during the fourth quarter. See Federal
Reserve Board, Statistical Release Z.1, “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,”

standards for C&I loans, and larger net fractions reported having eased terms for such
loans. Changes in lending policies for other categories of loans were mixed and
generally small. Meanwhile, moderate net fractions of respondents indicated that
demand for C&I loans had strengthened, and similar fractions reported that inquiries
from business borrowers for new or increased credit lines had picked up. In contrast,
demand reportedly weakened somewhat, on balance, for residential real estate loans and

M2 expanded at an annual rate of 4¼ percent in December, a bit below its pace in
November.6 Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, continued to increase rapidly
last month, while the contraction in small time deposits and retail money market mutual
funds persisted. The ongoing compositional shift within M2 toward liquid deposits likely
reflects their relatively higher yields compared with other components of M2. The rise in
currency stepped down in December to an annual rate of only about 3¾ percent, with part
of the slowdown stemming from severe winter weather that delayed shipments of new
U.S. currency to Europe. The monetary base increased at an annual rate of about
25 percent in December, as the Desk’s purchases of Treasury securities boosted reserve

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The January 2011 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
indicated that, during the fourth quarter of 2010, a modest net fraction of banks continued to ease
standards and terms for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans while banks reported small mixed
changes in their lending policies for other types of loans.1 The survey also indicated a notable
increase in the share of banks reporting strengthened demand for C&I loans. Nevertheless,
demand for most types of loans appeared to remain subdued, and lending standards likely
remained tight for many households and firms.
Domestic survey respondents reported having eased standards and most terms on
C&I loans to firms of all sizes, with a greater fraction of banks reporting having done so for large
firms.2 These movements are consistent with a continued and gradual unwinding of the
widespread tightening in standards that occurred over the past few years. Only one bank (a large
bank) reported tightening its standards somewhat. In explaining the net easing, banks mainly
credited increased competition from other banks and nonbank lenders; they also cited a more
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook, similar to the past three surveys.
On the household side, the net fraction of banks that reported having tightened standards
on nontraditional mortgage loans crept up for the second consecutive quarter, while banks, on net,
did not change standards on prime residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit
s
t
(HELOCs). Similarly, banks reported that changes in standards and terms on consumer loans had n

been small and mixed, though a modest net fraction reported easing spreads on non-credit-card

consumer loans, and banks again reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment o

businesses and households over the past three months. The survey also included sets of special questions
on factors affecting recent closed-end residential real estate loan growth, on changes in commercial real
estate loan terms over the past year, and on asset quality expectations for 2011. This appendix is based on
responses from 56 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Respondent banks
received the survey on or after December 22, 2010, and responses were due by January 11, 2011.

consumer loans, and a fair number reported that demand had weakened somewhat for residential
real estate loans.
A set of special questions asked respondents about asset quality expectations for 2011,
assuming that economic activity progresses in line with consensus forecasts. Large net fractions
of banks expected that credit quality would improve in all major loan categories, especially when
responses are weighted by the amount of outstanding loans in that category at the respondent
bank. Notably, a majority of banks expected the credit quality of commercial real estate (CRE)
loans to improve somewhat despite ongoing weakness in the fundamentals in that sector.
Expectations for improvement in the quality of residential real estate loans were subdued
compared with expectations for other categories.
Federal Reserve data indicate that banks in the aggregate have recently added to their
holdings of closed-end residential real estate loans. In response to a special question regarding
this increase, banks generally did not credit transitory factors, instead indicating that the rise was
due primarily to the relative attractiveness of holding these loans in their portfolios and a pickup
in originations of loans that are not eligible for securitization via government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs).

Questions on Commercial and Industrial Loans
The survey indicated that the market for C&I loans continued to thaw in the fourth
quarter. About 15 percent of banks reported having eased standards on C&I loans to large and
s
middle-market firms, with no banks reporting having tightened standards, and about 5 percent, on n t
e
net, reported easing to small firms, about the same as in the previous survey. The banks that m

eased standards were almost all large banks.3 o

a
the previous quarter, with about 50 percent of banks, on net, trimming spreads on loans to large n

and middle-market firms and 30 percent, on net, narrowing spreads on loans to small firms.
Somewhat smaller net fractions of banks lowered the costs of credit lines and lengthened the
maximum maturity for loans to firms of all sizes. The sizes of C&I credit lines and business
credit card accounts were reportedly little changed, continuing a period of stabilization after a
series of cuts in such lines seen in surveys during the first half of 2010.
Of banks that reported having eased standards or terms, large majorities pointed to
increased competition from other banks and nonbank lenders, as well as a more favorable or less
uncertain economic outlook, as reasons for the changes. Between 25 percent and 30 percent of

October 31, 2010, and other banks as those with assets of less than $20 billion.

respondents also cited reductions in defaults by borrowers in the public debt market, increased
tolerance for risk, and industry-specific improvements, with three banks noting improvements in
the auto supply industry.
Reports of strengthened demand for C&I loans were notably more widespread than in the
previous survey. About 30 percent of banks, on net, reported greater demand from large and
middle-market firms, and about 10 percent reported strengthened demand from small firms. In
addition, compared with the October survey, a noticeably larger fraction of banks reported an
increase in inquiries from business borrowers for new or increased credit lines. Of the banks
reporting stronger demand, about 80 percent indicated that the increased demand was due to
funding needs for merger and acquisition activity, and more than half noted reduced borrowing
from other banks or nonbank sources. Somewhat less than half of the banks also noted increased
financing needs for inventories, accounts receivable, and investment in plant and equipment. The
reported increase in demand in this survey is consistent with the increase in banks’ C&I loan
holdings during December, according to the Federal Reserve’s weekly statistical release H.8,
“Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States.”
A few branches and agencies of foreign banks (foreign banks) reported having eased
standards on C&I loans, while none of those institutions tightened standards. Foreign banks also
reported a small net increase in demand and in inquiries regarding lines of credit, in line with the
previous quarter.
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending
The January survey indicated some stabilization in CRE lending policies and a
s
strengthening of demand for such loans. Standards on CRE loans appear to have stabilized n t
e
(likely at a very stringent level, given the tightening reported in recent surveys), with little net m
p
movement in domestic bank lending standards in this survey or the previous survey. However, a o
l
e
few foreign banks reported having tightened standards. Roughly 25 percent of banks, on net, v
e
reported that they had reduced the sizes of lines of credit for commercial construction, about the D
l
same as in the previous quarter. a

A positive net fraction of domestic banks (about 15 percent) reported increased demand n

F
for CRE loans, the strongest reading since early 2006. Foreign banks also reported that demand
had strengthened on net. These reports are consistent with modest increases in commercial real
estate sales over the second half of 2010.
Special Question on Commercial Real Estate Terms
The survey included a special question regarding changes in terms on CRE loans over the
past year (repeated annually since 2001). Domestic banks reported that they generally tightened
such terms over 2010, but the tightening was less widespread than in 2009. Moreover, in contrast
to 2009, almost no banks reported having tightened loan terms considerably over the past
12 months. About 40 percent of banks, on net, tightened loan-to-value ratios, and moderately
smaller fractions tightened debt service coverage ratios and maximum loan sizes. Spreads,

LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending
Standards on prime closed-end residential real estate loans were little changed, on net,
over the fourth quarter. In contrast, standards on nontraditional loans were tightened by about
15 percent of banks, on net, a touch more than in the previous survey. The net fraction of banks
tightening standards on nontraditional loans has now increased a bit for two consecutive quarters,
after having fallen to nearly zero during the first half of 2010. Banks reported little net change in
standards for, or the sizes of, HELOCs.
Demand reportedly weakened somewhat, on net, for both prime and nontraditional
closed-end loans as well as for HELOCs. Reported demand for closed-end loans has now
declined for two consecutive surveys after having increased during parts of 2009 and 2010.
Special Question on Factors Affecting the Recent Increase in
Residential Real Estate Loans
A special question asked respondents about factors affecting the recent increase in
closed-end residential real estate loan holdings. According to the H.8 statistical release, banks’
aggregate holdings of closed-end residential real estate loans increased steadily over the second
half of 2010, despite standards for residential mortgages being little changed over the past six
s
t
months, and despite the reported net decrease in demand. About 45 percent of the respondents n
e
indicated that they had experienced growth in residential mortgage portfolios over that period. m
p
The majority of banks that recorded such increases noted the relative attractiveness of these loans o
l
e
compared with other assets and reported having become more willing to expand their overall v
e
balance sheets via this category of loans. About one-third of these banks also reported having D
l
originated an increased volume of loans that were not eligible for securitization through GSEs. a
i
c
n
a
n
Banks were somewhat less likely to credit their accumulations of closed-end residential
i
F
mortgages to transitory factors such as capacity constraints in securitizing loans or reduced
charge-offs or paydowns. Moreover, only two banks (neither of which was among the very
largest banks) attributed their loan accumulations to repurchases from the GSEs or other
securitization pools.
Questions on Consumer Lending
Only a small net fraction of banks reported having eased standards on consumer credit
card and non-credit-card loans in the fourth quarter, consistent with the past two surveys.
Indeed, a modest net fraction of banks, about 10 percent, reported cutting back the sizes of
consumer credit card lines.

Banks reported little change, on net, in most terms on consumer loans, with the exception
of spreads on non-credit-card loans and minimum credit scores on credit card loans, which were
eased by a modest net fraction of banks. The easing of terms on non-credit-card loans is
consistent with the still elevated fraction of banks that reported an increased willingness to make
consumer installment loans. Banks were somewhat split regarding changes in demand for
consumer loans, but on net they reported little change.
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON ASSET QUALITY EXPECTATIONS
Large net fractions of banks expected improvements in delinquency and charge-off rates
during 2011 in every major loan category, assuming that economic activity progresses in line
with consensus forecasts. This special question has been asked once each year during the past
four years, and expectations for improvement are more widespread in this survey than any prior
survey, consistent with the apparent peak in delinquency and charge-off rates in most loan
categories during 2010.
Banks were least likely to expect improvement in the quality of residential real estate
loans. Only about 25 percent of banks, on net, expected improvement in nontraditional closed-
end loans, and only about 35 percent of banks expected improvement in HELOCs. Almost
45 percent expected improvement for prime closed-end loans. Large banks were somewhat more
likely than small banks to expect improvement in the quality of residential real estate loans.
About 50 percent of banks, on net, expected improvement this year in the quality of
consumer loans, including both credit card loans and other loans. Similarly, about 55 percent of
banks expected improvement in the quality of CRE loans, with large banks more likely to expect s
t
n
improvement. These expectations are somewhat notable in their contrast to the weakness in CRE e
m
fundamentals. p

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY
The strengthening of final domestic demand late last year has reduced some of the
downside risk to our projection that seemed so prominent only a few months ago. As a
result, we now judge the risks to our projection for real activity as roughly balanced.
That said, we continue to see the risks around our projection for activity as elevated
relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the
Committee). The depth and duration of the recession as well as the severe financial crisis
that precipitated the downturn were large and historically unusual. These factors
compound the difficulty of identifying the roles of supply and demand in generating the
contraction, and hence the difficulty of assessing the strength of the expansion.
Moreover, the pace at which credit availability will improve is difficult to determine.
While recent indications suggest that lending conditions are gradually improving along
the lines anticipated by the staff, the risks to the outlook for credit supply remain sizable
(in both directions), reflecting the complicated interplay among the quality of assets held
by financial institutions, continued uncertainty regarding mortgage-related assets and
mortgage documentation problems, and the effects of regulatory reforms on lending
decisions over the next several years. Finally, we see outsized risks to the outlook for the
global outlook—to the downside in Europe, where concerns over fiscal sustainability in
several countries remain considerable, and to the upside in emerging market economies,
where activity could be much stronger than we now expect.
For a variety of reasons, we continue to see the risks around our inflation
projection as elevated relative to the experience of the past 20 years. Underlying
inflation has moved down to a very low level. The shocks generating the pronounced
contraction in labor and product markets were exceptionally large and unusual in
character. The federal funds rate is effectively at the zero lower bound, limiting the
scope for future actions. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded dramatically.
y
Future prospects for the dollar and hence import prices remain uncertain. Finally, fiscal n t
i
a
policy is judged by many observers to be on an unsustainable path. Weighing these risks t
r
e
c
to both the upside and downside, we continue to see the risks around our inflation n
U
projection as roughly balanced. &

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we consider several alternatives to
the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first scenario, we explore
the possibility that incoming data signal a more pronounced acceleration in economic
activity than that embedded in the staff projection. In the second scenario, a more robust
expansion is accompanied by a pronounced rise in inflation expectations and higher
commodity prices, thereby sparking a marked increase in both actual inflation and
nominal interest rates. We then turn to a downside risk for real activity—namely, that
demand for housing and commercial properties will weaken further, leading to another
round of sizable declines in property prices and spending on new construction. The
fourth scenario expands on this possibility by assuming that an intensified real estate
slump would have important spillover effects on financial markets, credit supply, and
confidence. In the fifth scenario, we present the implications of a more pronounced
disinflation, similar to that predicted by some of the staff’s reduced-form models. The
final two scenarios consider contrasting risks to the global outlook—specifically, the
possibility that ongoing fiscal and financial difficulties spark a recession in Europe, and
the chance that emerging market economies expand more vigorously than we anticipate
and put further upward pressure on oil prices.
In the alternative scenarios, monetary policy responds to movements in real
activity and inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule for the federal funds rate,
while nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the baseline path. We generate the first
five scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated policy rule. The last two
scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different
policy rule for the federal funds rate that employs an alternative concept of resource
utilization.1
Stronger Expansion
Overall, we interpret recent indicators as consistent with a gradual strengthening
in real activity this year and next. But some of the incoming data were appreciably
y
t
n
i stronger than we expected, and in this scenario we consider the risk that a more robust
a
t
r
e
c
n
U 1 For FRB/US, the federal funds rate follows the “outcome-based” rule, described in the appendix
&
on policy rules in Book B. In the case of SIGMA, its rule is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack
s
k equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would
s
R i occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

expansion is under way, spurred by a mutually reinforcing dynamic of improved
optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and increasing credit availability. The
stronger activity and improved optimism buoy financial markets and push equity prices
about 12 percent above baseline by the end of this year. This virtuous circle causes real
GDP to expand 4½ percent in 2011 and 5½ percent in 2012, bringing the unemployment
rate down to 7 percent by late 2012—a rebound in activity more in line with previous
recoveries from a deep recession. With less slack, inflation is higher; however, the
upward pressure on prices is partially checked by more capital deepening, and thus by
larger productivity gains, which hold down unit labor costs. Under these conditions, the
federal funds rate rises to ¾ percent by the end of 2011 and remains above baseline
thereafter.
Higher Inflation
A faster economic recovery would generate larger price effects if it raised
inflation expectations markedly, possibly because of concerns about whether the Federal
Reserve would tighten policy quickly enough in response to emerging inflation pressures.
Moreover, rising prices for oil and other commodities could increase inflationary
pressures somewhat further if a robust domestic expansion was accompanied by a
stronger global economy. Relative to the previous scenario, this one features higher
inflation expectations as well as stronger domestic and foreign activity. As a result, core
PCE inflation rises above 2 percent in 2012 and to almost 3 percent by the middle of the
decade. With inflation moving up quickly, real GDP persistently expanding at a pace
well above its potential, and the unemployment rate falling rapidly back to the NAIRU,
the federal funds rate begins to rise in the middle of this year and reaches as high as
6¾ percent in 2014. As investors seek protection against higher expected inflation and
respond to the anticipated tightening in monetary policy, long-term interest rates rise
much sooner and by substantially more than in the baseline, causing the 10-year Treasury
rate to reach 6¾ percent by the end of 2014.

than we expect. In this scenario, we assume that the slump in the real estate sector
intensifies. Specifically, house prices decline an additional 12 percent from the baseline
by the end of 2012, a development that not only discourages potential homebuyers and
causes housing starts to remain at their current levels, but also damps the recovery in
consumer spending by reducing household net worth. In addition, nonresidential
construction falls a further 17 percent. Under the assumption that these adverse
developments would not generate substantial spillovers in the financial sector, real GDP
rises 3½ percent per year on average from 2011 through 2013. As a result, the
unemployment rate declines very gradually and is still close to 8 percent by the end of
2013—1 percentage point above the baseline. With greater slack, inflation remains close
to 1 percent through the middle of the decade. These weak conditions push the liftoff of
the federal funds rate to late 2013.
Intensified Real Estate Slump with Spillovers
A further deterioration of conditions in the real estate sector might entail
significant losses for many financial institutions, renewing concerns about the adequacy
of banking-sector capital and causing credit terms and conditions for households and
businesses to tighten; such developments might also make the general economic outlook
more uncertain. This scenario builds on the previous one by assuming that falling real
estate prices and related factors lead to major credit losses, reduced credit availability,
and higher risk premiums. In addition, heightened uncertainty damages the confidence of
firms and households, causing them to delay their purchases of business capital and
consumer durables. On balance, real GDP rises only 2½ percent, on average, in 2011 and
2012. As a result, the unemployment rate remains close to 9 percent until 2014—a full
percentage point above what would occur in the absence of spillover effects—putting
additional downward pressure on inflation. In response, the federal funds rate remains
near zero until mid-2014.
Further Disinflation

expectations. But the stability of various measures of expected inflation to date may be r

misleading us about the potential for further disinflation in a persistently weak economy.
U
In this scenario, actual inflation falls below zero by 2013 and remains negative &
s
k
thereafter—a decline that is in line with the predictions of some of our forecasting s

equations that do not condition on survey measures of expected inflation. In addition,
investors become less certain about the course of future inflation. As a result, bond
premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long-term interest rates, thereby modestly
damping spending and boosting unemployment relative to baseline over the next few
years. In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate
remains at its effective lower bound until early 2014. In the longer run, monetary policy
is sufficiently stimulative to bring the unemployment rate eventually below baseline and
to check the deflationary pressure.
Severe European Recession
In light of the risks posed by fiscal and financial problems in Europe, this scenario
incorporates a large rise in European sovereign and private yields relative to the baseline
projection and a substantial fall in the euro. Specifically, the scenario assumes that an
intensification of problems in European financial markets spills over to financial markets
in the United States and in our major non-European trading partners. In addition,
European sovereign spreads rise 150 basis points by early next year relative to baseline,
investment-grade corporate bond spreads in Europe rise about twice as much, and
European real GDP falls more than 5 percent relative to baseline next year despite a
depreciation of the euro of more than 20 percent against the dollar. U.S. net exports are
adversely affected by the stronger dollar and weaker foreign activity, and domestic
demand is restrained by a 50 basis point rise in U.S. investment-grade corporate bond
spreads, a weaker stock market, and reduced confidence. Altogether, U.S. real GDP rises
just 2½ percent in 2011 and 3½ percent in 2012, and the unemployment rate remains
above 9 percent through mid 2012. The greater resource slack, coupled with lower
import prices, pushes PCE inflation down to about ½ percent in 2011 and 2012. The
federal funds rate lifts off later and stays lower than in the baseline.
Foreign Boom with Higher Oil Prices
We project that real activity in the emerging market economies (EMEs) will
y
t
n expand about 5 percent. In this scenario, the EMEs expand more rapidly than under our
i
a
r t baseline in response to faster-than-expected growth in domestic demand that is partly
e
c
n fueled by robust productivity growth. The stronger global demand, which we assume
U
& will fall disproportionately on oil-intensive products (such as automobiles), leads to a
s
k substantial rise in the price of oil. All told, aggregate foreign GDP rises 2½ percent

above baseline by the end of 2012, and oil prices rise 30 percent above baseline—to
about $120 per barrel. In the near term, the expansion of foreign activity and an
associated depreciation of the dollar boost U.S. real net exports, lifting the increase in
U.S. real GDP to about 4¼ percent in 2011. U.S. core inflation is about ¼ percentage
point above baseline due to a combination of stronger U.S. activity, dollar depreciation,
and higher oil prices; headline inflation is nearly ¾ percentage point above baseline. By
2013, U.S. GDP growth falls below baseline because of monetary policy tightening,
which starts earlier than in the baseline, and higher oil prices, which exert some drag on
potential GDP.
OUTSIDE FORECASTS
The Blue Chip consensus forecast for real GDP released in early January showed
a marked improvement in participants’ expectations for economic activity this year. The
consensus projection now anticipates a 3.3 percent increase in real GDP over the four
quarters of 2011, 0.4 percentage point higher than reported in the December survey; real
GDP is expected to advance at a similar pace in 2012. While the Blue Chip consensus
for real GDP growth is weaker than the staff outlook through 2012, survey participants
indicated that they saw notable upside risks to the outlook for real activity. Similarly, the
Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 is 8.4 percent, about
½ percentage point higher than the staff projection. Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip
consensus anticipates the total CPI increasing 1.8 percent over the four quarters of 2011
and 2.0 percent in 2012, little changed from its projection from a month earlier and
higher than the staff forecasts of 1.5 percent in 2011 and 0.9 percent in 2012. The Blue
Chip forecast for short-term interest rates shows a more pronounced increase in 2012
than assumed by the staff, while the Blue Chip path for long-term interest rates is broadly
similar to the staff projection.
