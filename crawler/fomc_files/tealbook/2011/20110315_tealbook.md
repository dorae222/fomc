Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information we have received since the time of the January Tealbook D
n
suggests that the economic recovery has continued to proceed at a moderate pace. o
c
E
Although the rise in real GDP in the fourth quarter was about ½ percentage point less
c
i
t
than the previous Tealbook forecast and consumer spending in January came in below s
e
m
our expectations, the limited information that we have for February has thus far been o
D
more encouraging. Moreover, forward-looking signals of activity in coming months
point to solid growth, much along the lines of what we anticipated in the January
Tealbook. In particular, the latest indicators of factory output and business equipment
spending have remained upbeat, motor vehicle sales picked up noticeably in February,
and readings from the labor market have been stronger, on net, than we had anticipated.
In all, the incoming data appear consistent with real GDP increasing at an annual rate
averaging 3½ percent in the first half of this year, just slightly below our forecast in the
January Tealbook.
The trajectory of our medium-term forecast is also quite similar to that in the
previous Tealbook. While equity prices are somewhat higher in this projection and the
exchange value of the dollar a little lower, these positive influences on activity are
essentially offset by higher oil prices and slightly more-restrictive fiscal policy
assumptions. As a result, we continue to project that the pace of real GDP growth will
step up to 3¾ percent in 2011 and to 4½ percent in 2012. As has been true in previous
projections, economic activity this year and next should be supported by accommodative
monetary policy, increasing credit availability, and rising household and business
confidence. Meanwhile, we have taken on board the appreciable decline in the
unemployment rate in recent months, putting the projected jobless rate at 8½ percent at
the end of this year and 7½ percent at the end of 2012, several tenths below our forecast
in the January Tealbook.
In response to the narrower margin of resource slack in this projection and a
higher path of energy and import prices, we have marked up our projection for inflation
relative to the January Tealbook. In particular, we have boosted our forecast for core
PCE inflation by ¼ percentage point to 1¼ percent in both 2011 and 2012. Given our
projections for the continued pass-through of near-term commodity price increases into

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS D e
n
o
Monetary Policy c
E
c
We now assume that the FOMC will raise the target federal funds rate above the i
t
s
e
current range of 0 to ¼ percent in the third quarter of 2012—two quarters earlier than we m
o
assumed in the January Tealbook—and that the rate will average ½ percent in the fourth D
quarter of 2012. This revision in the liftoff date keeps our policy assumption broadly in
line with the prescriptions of the outcome-based policy rule that is used to set monetary
policy in the long-run economic outlook. Regarding nonconventional monetary policy,
we have retained our assumption that the Federal Reserve will expand its holdings of
longer-term Treasury securities through the second quarter of 2011, thus completing the
$600 billion increment to the size of the portfolio that was announced last fall. We
continue to assume that when the FOMC first raises its target for the federal funds rate, it
will stop reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.
Financial Conditions
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has increased about 15 basis points since
mid-January, and we have slightly raised the projected level of this yield in the near and
medium term. As in recent projections, we anticipate that the 10-year Treasury yield will
increase nearly 1 percentage point by the end of 2012. The movement of the valuation
window through the projected period of near-zero short-term interest rates continues to be
the primary factor contributing to the rise in yields. Since the January Tealbook, yields
on investment-grade corporate bonds and interest rates on conforming fixed-rate
mortgages have increased about in line with Treasury yields. With current spreads little
changed, we have not altered our path of projected spreads.
The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is almost 2 percent above the level
anticipated in the January Tealbook. Through mid-February, stock prices registered an
even larger gain, but share prices have moved down recently because of mounting
concerns about the economic consequences of political unrest in the Middle East and
North Africa. The equity premium has remained well above longer-run norms, and, over
the projection period, we expect it to decline gradually toward a more typical level.

k
o
o
l
u t Thus, we expect stock prices to increase at an annual rate of about 10 percent through the
O
end of 2012.
&
l
e
v
e According to the latest readings from CoreLogic, home prices continued to
D
n decrease through January. However, the data now show a somewhat smaller drop in
o
c
E recent months than we had anticipated, and we have marked up the level of home prices
c
i
t in the first quarter of this year by 2 percent relative to the January Tealbook.
s
e
m
Nonetheless, the incoming data continue to suggest that the housing market remains
o
D
weak, and we did not materially revise our outlook for changes in home prices over the
medium term. We expect the CoreLogic repeat sales index to decline 3½ percent in 2011
and to be unchanged in 2012.
Fiscal Policy
Our fiscal policy assumptions are slightly more restrictive in this projection. In
particular, we now assume that nominal appropriations for federal discretionary spending
will turn down in fiscal years 2011 and 2012, whereas we previously assumed that they
would be about flat.1 We continue to expect that federal fiscal policy actions will be a
roughly neutral influence on aggregate demand in 2011 as the impetus from the one-year
cut in payroll taxes and from the full expensing allowance for business investment is
essentially offset by some reduction in stimulus-related grants to state and local
governments. In 2012, however, federal fiscal actions are expected to impose a drag of
about 1 percent of GDP as real purchases decline, the payroll tax cuts lapse, the
Emergency Unemployment Compensation program is phased out, the stimulus grants for
states and localities are essentially exhausted, and the expensing provision for business
investment is scaled back.
As in the January projection, we expect the budget deficit to reach $1.4 trillion
(about 9 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2011 and then narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012
(around 7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the further tapering off of stimulus-
related policies and the higher revenues associated with a faster pace of economic
1 The Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal 2011 would raise discretionary budget authority
by $30 billion above the fiscal 2010 level, but a recently passed House bill would cut it by about
$60 billion. We are now assuming a cut in total discretionary appropriations of $15 billion for fiscal 2011,
about halfway between the two proposals, and a cut in funding of about $30 billion in 2012, both relative to
the fiscal 2010 level. It is worth noting that budget proposals are often portrayed under a variety of
baselines, making them hard to compare.

activity. Correspondingly, federal debt is projected to rise to over 70 percent of GDP at u t
O
the end of fiscal 2012.
&
l
e
v
Foreign Activity and the Dollar e
D
n
Incoming data on economic activity in the foreign economies have been o
c
somewhat more upbeat than we anticipated in January. Foreign real GDP expanded at a E
c
i
3¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter and will likely exceed that pace in the current s t
e
m
quarter. Going forward, we see foreign GDP increasing about 3½ percent this year and
o
D
next, propelled by continuing robust growth in the emerging market economies and some
firming of activity in the advanced foreign economies. This outlook, however, is slightly
weaker than in the January forecast because of the greater headwinds arising from the
sharp rise in world oil prices.
The foreign exchange value of the dollar in real terms is currently about
1¼ percent lower than we had projected at the time of the January forecast. From this
lower starting point, we assume that the dollar will depreciate at an annual rate of about
3½ percent over the forecast period, a pace about unchanged from what we had written
down in January.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
Recent developments in the Middle East and North Africa have pushed oil prices
sharply higher. At present, the main disruption to oil production has been in Libya,
where an estimated 1.2 million barrels per day of productive capacity have been shut in.
Saudi Arabia has reportedly increased its oil output, though it is not clear how much of
the Libyan shortfall it is currently replacing. (For details, see the box “Economic Risks
from the Middle East and North Africa” in the International Economic Developments and
Outlook section.) In response to these developments, the spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has climbed more than $13 per barrel since the time of the
January Tealbook, closing on March 8 at $105 per barrel. Prices for delivery later in the
projection period have also moved up, but not as much as spot and very near-term futures
prices. Consistent with futures prices, we now project that the spot price of WTI will end
2012 at about $104 per barrel, roughly $8 higher than at the time of the previous
Tealbook.
Nonfuel commodity prices have continued to move up sharply, increasing about
6 percent on average since the January Tealbook. Prices of a range of food commodities

u t have increased, reflecting continued strong demand combined with tight supply
O
conditions. (For additional detail, see the box “Food Prices and Foreign Inflation” in the
&
e l International Economic Developments and Outlook section.) Metals prices have also
v
e
D increased on the strength of global demand, especially from the manufacturing sector.
n
o We project that commodity prices for both food and metals will flatten out near their
c
E
current elevated levels, consistent with quotes in futures markets.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
o
D
We expect real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the current quarter,
the same pace as in the fourth quarter. Although consumer spending appears to have
decelerated this quarter and construction spending remains weak, business outlays for
equipment and software (E&S) look to be on track for a robust gain. In the second
quarter, we expect real GDP to accelerate to a 3¾ percent pace as increases in consumer
spending pick back up and business fixed investment continues to rise briskly.
Labor Markets
The labor market recovery seems to be gaining strength. Private nonfarm payrolls
jumped 222,000 in February after having increased an estimated 68,000 in January. The
swing from January to February was likely exaggerated by widespread snowstorms that
held down employment during the January survey reference week, but, on the whole, the
employment data received since the previous Tealbook have been a bit stronger than
expected, with the cumulative gains in private payroll employment since November about
50,000 higher than in the January forecast.
Readings from the household survey have also been encouraging. In January, the
unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage point for a second month, and it ticked down an
additional 0.1 percentage point, to 8.9 percent, in February. The sharp drop in the
unemployment rate since November has been surprising, but we are nonetheless viewing
it as further evidence of a strengthening labor market.2 In addition, the share of workers
employed part time for economic reasons declined by ½ percentage point over this
period, to 6 percent. That said, not all of the news has been good: The labor force
participation rate has held steady in recent months at a level that we judge to be well
2 As described later in this document, we have interpreted some of the movements in the
unemployment and labor force participation rates as suggesting that the rate of potential output growth has
been somewhat lower than we had assumed previously.

u t below even its declining trend, and long-term unemployment remains extremely high.
O
(See the box “The Labor Force Participation Rate” for further discussion.)
&
l
e
v
e Other labor market indicators point to a continued pickup in payrolls. Weekly
D
n initial claims for unemployment insurance have moved below the 400,000 mark, and
o
c
E hiring measures—such as the help wanted index and the NFIB index of hiring plans—
c
i
t have improved noticeably in recent months. Moreover, individuals’ outlooks on labor
s
e
m
market conditions have become more favorable, as is evident from the greater optimism
o
D
about future labor market conditions expressed by respondents to the Thomson Reuters/
Michigan survey.
In light of these improvements, we have strengthened slightly our near-term
projection for the labor market. We now look for private payrolls to rise 200,000 in
March, and about 220,000 per month, on average, in the second quarter, both about
10,000 above the January Tealbook forecast. In addition, we expect the unemployment
rate to remain at 8.9 percent over the next several months, about 0.5 percentage point
below the level we had expected as of the time of the January forecast.
The Industrial Sector
Following a strong rise in December, industrial production (IP) edged down in
January, as the output of mines and utilities declined and the rate of increase in
manufacturing output was limited somewhat by heavy snowfalls. In the motor vehicle
sector, production rose in January but was restrained, in part, by some temporary
bottlenecks in the supply chain. Nonetheless, with assembly schedules calling for
production to rise sharply this quarter and next, we expect the production of motor
vehicles and parts to increase more than 20 percent at an annual rate over the first half of
this year. Outside of motor vehicles, last month’s reading on production-worker hours
and the available weekly physical product data suggest that output in the factory sector
expanded at a robust pace in February, and the positive readings from the new orders
diffusion indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys imply further solid
production gains in coming months. In total, we now expect industrial production to rise
at an annual rate of 6 percent over the first half of the year—a bit faster than projected in
the January Tealbook.

Household Spending u t
O
The recovery in consumer spending appears to be proceeding at a moderate pace. &
l
Although retail sales in January were considerably weaker than we were expecting, it e
v
e
seems likely that unseasonably poor weather across much of the country was an D
n
important factor holding down spending that month, and we expect to see a bounceback o
c
E
in February. In this regard, sales of new autos and light trucks jumped to an annual rate c
i
t
of 13.4 million units last month, an increase of 800,000 units from January's reading. We e s
m
continue to expect the pace of other (non-auto) real spending to pick up in the next few o
D
months, as ongoing improvements in the labor market and the boost to disposable
incomes arising from the temporary reductions in payroll taxes this year more than offset
the drag from higher energy prices. In addition, the latest readings on consumer
sentiment have improved a bit further in recent months. All told, we expect real PCE to
rise at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first half of this year, about ¼ percentage point
below our projection in the January Tealbook.
Restrained by weak demand and a considerable overhang of vacant homes for
sale, residential construction remains depressed. Single-family housing starts and permits
have changed little since last summer, and single-family new home sales have been
moribund over this period. However, with job growth gradually strengthening and
housing quite affordable, we expect demand for new homes to creep up over the near
term and for starts to rise slowly. Increases in activity should be more noticeable in the
multifamily sector, where starts moved higher in January and where vacancy rates have
been trending down. In all, our forecast calls for residential investment to rise at annual
rates of about 4 percent in the first quarter and 7 percent in the second.
Business Investment
After increasing at an estimated annual rate of about 7 percent in the fourth
quarter, real business investment in E&S is projected to resume double-digit growth in
the first half of this year. Outlays in the fourth quarter were held down by a large drop in
business purchases of transportation equipment, but we expect spending in this volatile
category to rebound this quarter. Meanwhile, outside the transportation sector, the orders
backlog for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft has continued to rise in recent
months, pointing to additional solid increases in shipments in coming months. The latest
readings on business sentiment are also consistent with robust near-term gains in E&S
outlays, and credit conditions have generally continued to improve. As a result, we

e The Labor Force Participation Rate
D
n
o The labor force participation rate (the black line in the figure on the
c
E facing page) has fallen sharply since the onset of the recent recession. In
c
i part, the nearly 2 percentage point decline over this period reflects
t
s
e cyclical factors. The decline also reflects the influence of a downward
m
o underlying trend in participation, an estimate of which is shown as the
D
solid red line in the figure.
For the past 10 years, the dominant force behind the downward trend in
participation has been the aging of the population, a process that we
expect will continue to push the trend lower for the next two decades.
To illustrate this effect, the dashed red line in the figure holds the
participation rate of each age group constant at its 1996 level, while
allowing the share of each age group in the population to evolve as it has
in the data. This line has fallen substantially since 2001, reflecting the
increasing share in the population of persons aged 55 and over, who are
less likely to participate in the labor market than their younger
counterparts. Of course, secular changes in participation rates within
age groups—which cause the solid red trend line to differ from the
dashed red line that isolates the aging effects—can be significant as well;
notably, the influx of women into the workforce was the primary
development accounting for the steep increase in participation during
the 1970s and 1980s. However, these types of movements have not
been large, on balance, over the past two decades.
Cyclical factors also have influenced the participation rate substantially
over the past few years. Probably the most important of these factors
has been the deterioration in job prospects, which has likely caused
many individuals to leave or refrain from entering the labor force. This
influence was likely offset in part by the availability since mid‐2008 of
extended and emergency unemployment insurance benefits and by the
drop in household wealth, both of which have raised the value or
necessity of participation.
As noted previously, we expect the participation rate to move up toward
its declining trend in the coming years as improving job prospects draw
more people into the labor force—a development only partially offset by

the anticipated winding down of the emergency unemployment n

c
compensation program next year. However, consistent with our E
forecast for a moderate recovery in economic activity more broadly, we c
i
t
expect that a considerable amount of time will pass before the e
s
m
participation rate returns to its trend. All told, we project the
o
D
participation rate to end 2012 at about 64½ percent, still roughly
¼ percentage point below our estimate of the trend and only
¼ percentage point above its current level.
Our projection for labor force participation has both upside and
downside risks. Nonetheless, given the profound changes in the age
distribution of the population currently under way, we consider it very
unlikely that the participation rate will return to its pre‐recession levels.

Despite some quarterly fluctuations in spending, business outlays on e

nonresidential structures continue to trend downward. Spending rose in the fourth n

incentive; data through January suggest that such spending is dropping off sharply this
o
D
quarter, while investment in other types of buildings has continued to decline. Looking
forward, recent readings on architectural billings, which are a useful indicator of
spending several months out, suggest that spending will flatten around the middle of the
year. Meanwhile, elevated energy prices should sustain sizable increases in expenditures
on drilling and mining structures in coming months. Altogether, we expect investment in
nonresidential structures to fall at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter but to be
about flat in the second.
The limited data we have on hand suggest that real nonfarm inventory investment
turned up again in the first quarter following an abrupt fourth-quarter pause that
subtracted 3½ percentage points from real GDP growth. After a sizable drawdown in the
fourth quarter, stocks of light motor vehicles edged up, on net, in January and February,
and manufacturers’ assembly plans are consistent with further increases in coming
months. Outside of motor vehicles, the available book-value data and indicators of
manufacturing activity also suggest that the pace of stockbuilding has stepped back up.
Overall, inventories appear fairly well aligned with sales: The staff’s flow of goods
system shows only a handful of sectors where inventories appear elevated (construction
materials, chemicals, and primary metals), and motor vehicle stocks appear quite lean.
All told, we expect nonfarm inventory investment to boost real GDP growth in the
current quarter by about 1 percentage point at an annual rate and to be close to neutral in
the second quarter.
Government
Real federal purchases were about unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2010, as a
decline in defense purchases was offset by an increase in nondefense purchases.
Available information on defense spending suggests a moderate decline in real federal
purchases this quarter. However, we expect real purchases to rebound in the second
quarter, as defense spending returns to a level more consistent with past appropriations.

News from the state and local sector has been more downbeat than expected. u t
O
Real state and local purchases fell at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the fourth quarter of
&
last year, a significantly steeper decline than projected in the January Tealbook. The e l
v
e
decline primarily reflected a 10 percent reduction in real construction expenditures, D
n
although a further trimming of payrolls in this sector was also a factor. The available o
c
E
information on construction spending and employment points to another sizable drop in
c
i
t
expenditures in the current quarter, and, in response, we have also marked down our s
e
m
forecast for the second quarter. As a result, we now project real state and local spending o
D
to decline at an annual rate of about 1½ percent over the first half of 2011; in the January
Tealbook, we had expected spending to be about flat over this period.
Foreign Trade
Supported by solid foreign economic growth, real exports of goods and services
are projected to increase at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the first half of 2011.
This projection for exports is above that in the January Tealbook, reflecting the lower
level of the dollar and recent indicators that suggest stronger foreign real activity.
We expect imports to bounce back after their sharp decline in the fourth quarter
and to expand at an 8 percent rate in the first half of the year, in line with the continuing
recovery of economic activity in the United States. This projection is a touch softer than
in our previous forecast, owing largely to the lower near-term pace of U.S. real GDP
growth and to our reaction to the trade data for December.
All told, we expect net exports to add about ¼ percentage point to U.S. GDP
growth in the first quarter and to turn neutral in the second quarter. These projections
have been revised up a little over ¼ percentage point on average, reflecting the upward
revisions to exports and downward revisions to imports.
Prices and Wages
After increasing at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, total
PCE prices are projected to increase 3¼ percent in the first quarter of this year before
stepping back down to a 2¼ percent pace in the second. Sharp increases in consumer
energy prices boosted inflation last quarter, and we project even larger increases in
energy prices this quarter. In addition, we expect the recent rise in farm commodity
prices to show through more noticeably at the retail level, so that food prices accelerate as
well. In the second quarter, food price inflation is projected to remain elevated while

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 9, 2011
k
o
o
l
u t consumer energy prices are projected to decelerate somewhat, leading to the step-down in
O
overall inflation. Since the January Tealbook, we have revised up our forecast for total
&
e l PCE price inflation 1¼ percentage points in the first quarter and about 1 percentage point
v
e
D in the second quarter.
n
o
c
E We have made much smaller revisions to our forecast of core inflation. We had
c
i
t seen the increase in core prices of just ½ percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter as
s
e
m
transitorily low and had therefore been looking for a rebound in core inflation this
o
D
quarter, and indeed that rebound appears to have taken place. We now expect core PCE
prices to rise about 1 percent this quarter and 1¼ percent in the second—in both periods,
¼ percentage point higher than in the January Tealbook. The upward revisions reflect a
somewhat higher-than-anticipated reading on core PCE inflation in January as well as
larger-than-expected increases in import and commodity prices.
Measures of long-term inflation expectations have changed little since the January
Tealbook. Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Thomson
Reuters/Michigan survey edged up to 2.9 percent in the final January survey and
remained at that level in February. Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next
10 years, as measured by the Survey of Professional Forecasters, reversed a small
downtick in the fourth quarter of last year and are back to 2.1 percent in the current
quarter. Since the time of the January Tealbook, the TIPS-based measure of five-year
inflation compensation is up ¼ percentage point while the five-year forward rate of
inflation compensation is little changed.
The P&C measure of hourly compensation increased at an annual rate of
2 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations in the January Tealbook.
The employment cost index (ECI) rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate—also close to our
expectations. However, average hourly earnings in January and February were higher
than anticipated, on average, and we raised our projection for the increase in
compensation per hour in the current quarter to an annual rate of 3 percent, about
½ percentage point above the January Tealbook projection. As in previous Tealbook
forecasts, we expect that the first-quarter increase in hourly compensation, as well as the
ECI, will be temporarily boosted by an increase in employer contributions to state
unemployment insurance funds, and we project smaller increases in the second quarter.

THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK u t
O
&
Our medium term outlook has changed little since the January Tealbook, with real
l
e
v
GDP still projected to increase 3¾ percent in 2011 and 4½ percent in 2012. Although the e
D
similarities in top-line GDP growth mask some small differences in its composition, the n
o
c
basic story of the projection remains the same: Private demand accelerates this year and E
c
next as the drag from earlier declines in wealth diminishes, lending standards ease t i
s
e
further, the labor market gradually recovers, and household and business confidence m
o
D
continue to recuperate. However, a number of factors still weigh on the outlook,
including a large overhang of vacant residential and commercial properties, the waning of
federal fiscal stimulus, and budgetary pressures on state and local governments. As a
result, the projected recovery is less robust than those that have typically followed deep
U.S. recessions, and we expect the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 to remain
elevated at 7½ percent.
As in previous Tealbooks, we expect consumer spending to gradually accelerate
over the forecast period in response to the same factors that drive the broader recovery.
In addition, the one-year reduction in payroll taxes boosts PCE growth in 2011, although
some of that boost is reversed in 2012 when the tax cut expires. Relative to the January
Tealbook, our projection for real PCE growth in 2011—at 3¼ percent—is somewhat
lower, reflecting the weaker-than-expected incoming data and higher oil prices; in 2012,
we project real PCE to rise almost 4 percent, close to the January projection. Largely
because spending is projected to respond gradually to the extra disposable income
generated by the payroll tax cut, the personal saving rate is expected to move up to
5¾ percent this year but then to drop back down to 5¼ percent in 2012 when the tax cut
expires, a shade below our current estimate for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Similarly, business outlays on E&S are projected to post solid gains of more than
11 percent, on average, over the next two years, as rising sales, improved business
confidence, and expanded availability of bank credit induce firms to replace aging capital
and expand their capacity. In addition, investment demand should continue to be
supported by projects that were postponed during the recession. Finally, we expect that
the expensing provisions of the stimulus package will slightly raise the rate of growth of
equipment investment in 2011 and reduce it in 2012.
We also expect net exports to make a positive contribution to GDP growth,
amounting to about ¼ percentage point per year on average over the forecast period.

Continued modest dollar depreciation and robust foreign activity should bolster real u t
O
exports of goods and services; in our forecast, exports expand at an annual rate of nearly
&
10 percent this year and next. Real imports are projected to rise almost 6 percent on e l
v
e
average in 2011 and 2012, as the boost from U.S. demand growth is only partly offset by D
n
the drag from the depreciating dollar. In all, the contribution from net exports is expected o
c
E
to be slightly stronger than in our previous forecast on account of the lower value of the
c
i
t
dollar. s
e
m
o
D
In contrast, the outlook for the construction sector remains bleak. Although we
still expect housing demand to strengthen a bit in coming quarters as the declines in
house prices taper off and prospects for jobs and incomes improve, homebuilding will
continue to be held down by a large and persistent overhang of vacant homes. As a
result, we project only a gradual firming in new construction, with single-family housing
starts reaching an annual rate of 660,000 units by the end of 2012—more than 200,000
units higher than in the current quarter but still well below the pace we believe is
consistent with the longer-run demand for housing. In the nonresidential sector, we
anticipate the declines in spending to taper off. But high vacancy rates, low commercial
property prices, and persistent tight borrowing conditions for construction loans for
commercial real estate will likely prevent any meaningful recovery in building
construction over the medium term. Although high energy prices will likely continue to
provide some support for investment in drilling and mining structures, we expect
investment in nonresidential structures as a whole to be about flat through 2012.
Government purchases are projected to be a slight drag on real GDP growth
throughout the forecast period. In the federal sector, reductions in spending related to
overseas military operations, the phasing out of stimulus-related nondefense spending,
and the tightened environment for discretionary appropriations are projected to lead to a
marked deceleration in real federal purchases, from a 5 percent rise in 2010 to negligible
growth in 2011 and a decline of ¾ percent in 2012. In the state and local sector, budgets
are expected to be bolstered by a continued rise in tax receipts over the forecast period.
However, the phase-out of the federal stimulus funds will partially offset this revenue
increase, and we expect real spending to be quite restrained—falling ¾ percent in 2011
and rising only ½ percent in 2012. (See the box “The Fiscal Condition of State and Local
Governments” for further discussion.)

O
The Fiscal Condition of State and Local Governments
&
l
e
e
v
State and local governments have faced significant fiscal strains since the onset of the
D
recession, primarily because of a drop in their tax revenues. Tax receipts, shown in the
n
o left‐hand figure below, plunged in 2009, reflecting the adverse effects of the economic
E
c
downturn on income and sales taxes, most of which are collected by state governments.
c In contrast, property tax collections—primarily accruing at the local level—continued to
i
t
s rise despite the fall in house prices. It appears that property tax collections have been
e
m held up by the substantial lag from market values to assessed values and by the
o
D willingness of some jurisdictions to raise property tax rates. Nevertheless, local
governments have had substantial budget difficulties due to cuts in grants‐in‐aid from
state governments.
The non‐infrastructure stimulus grants provided by the federal government, the dark
gray area in the right‐hand figure below, have helped offset much of the shortfall in tax
revenues seen by states and localities. Even so, these governments have reduced
operating expenditures other than transfers in order to satisfy requirements that
operating budgets be balanced and to meet an increased demand for Medicaid (which
reflects, in part, a cyclical pickup).1 Notably, as shown in the left‐hand figure on the facing
page, the sector trimmed payrolls by roughly 400,000 workers over the past two years
with the decline mostly at the local level. Turning to capital budgets, construction
expenditures (not shown) have fallen about 8 percent from their peak in mid 2009.2 As a
result of the cuts in total purchases, the sector subtracted about 0.15 percentage point
from the rate of change in real GDP in both 2009 and 2010.
1 Operating budgets, as presented in the national income and product accounts, consist of
operating revenues (tax receipts plus non‐infrastructure grants)—the black line in the right‐hand figure
above—and operating expenditures (expenditures excluding outlays for infrastructure)—the red line in
the figure. Revenues (including grants) and expenditures associated with infrastructure projects are
part of separate capital budgets.
2 The reduction in construction outlays is heavily concentrated in the local education category. In
contrast, highway construction, which is receiving considerable support from the infrastructure stimulus
grants provided by the federal government, has increased over this period.

o
l
t
u
Balanced‐budget requirements typically restrict states and localities from issuing bonds O
to finance operating deficits. These governments do, however, issue debt to finance &
their capital expenditures, and the sector’s overall debt burden has climbed somewhat in e l
v
recent years; at 16 percent of GDP, though, it is no higher than it was in the early 1990s. e
D
Moreover, interest payments on debt are a small share—roughly 5 percent—of the total
n
outlays of state and local governments. o
c
E
c
We expect aggregate state and local revenue collections to improve gradually as the i
t
s
economic recovery progresses. However, because the unwinding of the federal stimulus e
m
funds is expected to offset a large part of the cyclical pickup in tax receipts, state and
o
local government spending is likely to remain quite subdued this year and next. We D
project that the purchases of state and local governments, the right‐hand figure below,
will subtract roughly 0.1 percentage point from the growth rate of real GDP in 2011 and
add only a bit in 2012—a contribution to economic activity substantially below the
sector’s long‐run historical average. Fiscal conditions vary considerably among
jurisdictions and undoubtedly those states and localities experiencing the most severe
strains will find it necessary to reduce outlays or raise taxes materially. However, viewed
from the perspective of the sector as a whole, the spending restraint in our forecast is
sufficient to keep operating budgets in surplus through 2012—the difference between
the black and red solid lines in the right‐hand figure on the facing page.
Looking beyond the medium‐term recovery in state and local government finances, the
sector faces several daunting long‐term challenges. Perhaps most important, these
governments have an estimated $2 trillion to $3 trillion in unfunded accrued pension
liabilities. Accrued pension benefits are generally protected by constitutional or tough
statutory provisions and, therefore, are likely ultimately to be funded. Although
unfunded pensions are a significant long‐term challenge, these governments typically
have ample assets on hand to cover current payments, and most will have many years in
which to address this issue. Governments will also confront the rising expense of
providing health care to their retired employees. These obligations are almost
completely unfunded and, in present value terms, are estimated by some analysts to be
in the neighborhood of $600 billion. Unlike pensions, though, these obligations are
generally not afforded the same level of legal protection and so could be adjusted more
easily. Finally, states will continue to confront budget pressures as Medicaid outlays are
pushed higher by continued fast‐rising health‐care costs.

growth, partly on the view that the recent low readings on labor force participation
suggest that the participation rate has been on a steeper downtrend than we had been
assuming. In contrast, we have made no changes to our estimate of structural labor
productivity, which is still assumed to rise about 2 percent per year over the projection
period, with a step-up in capital deepening largely offset by a deceleration in structural
multifactor productivity. We have also retained our assumption that the NAIRU will
remain at 6 percent though 2012.3
Productivity and the Labor Market
As with our projection for real activity, the forecast for the labor market is similar
to that in the January Tealbook. Although labor productivity has risen somewhat faster
than its structural rate in recent quarters, we continue to expect the gap between the levels
of actual and structural productivity to narrow over the medium term as firms add
workers both to meet rising production needs and to relieve pressures on their existing
workforces. Our forecast therefore calls for employment growth to pick up steadily over
the projection period and for actual labor productivity growth to slow to about 1½ percent
on average in 2011 and 2012, appreciably less than our estimate of its structural growth
rate of about 2 percent.
In particular, we continue to project that private employment gains will step up
from an average pace of 190,000 per month in the first half of this year to 270,000 per
month in the second half of 2011 and 300,000 per month in 2012. Given the sharp
decline in the unemployment rate since the previous Tealbook and the similar pace of job
growth in this projection, the unemployment rate in this forecast is lower than in the
3 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the effect of extended and emergency
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemployment rate that we view as being consistent with no
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the January projection and is now about 6½ percent. As
before, we expect the effective NAIRU to decline to around 6 percent by the end of 2012 as the extended
and emergency unemployment benefit programs expire.

Resource Utilization e
D
n
The sharp decline in the unemployment rate and the reduction in potential GDP o
c
mean that the economy has a bit less slack in this projection than in the January E
c
i
Tealbook. Nonetheless, the amount of current and projected slack remains large. By our s t
e
m
estimate, the unemployment rate in the current quarter is about 2½ percentage points
o
D
above the “effective” NAIRU, and at the end of next year, the unemployment gap is still
1½ percentage points. This extended period of labor market slack is likely to be
associated with other features of a weak labor market, including below-trend labor force
participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily on part-time schedules,
and an unusually large concentration of workers experiencing long-duration
unemployment spells.
We continue to expect slack in the industrial sector to be taken up sooner than in
the economy as a whole, in part because manufacturing capacity, after a cumulative
decline of 1½ percent in 2009 and 2010, is projected to increase only ¾ percent this year
and 1½ percent in 2012. As a result, by the end of 2012, our projection calls for the
factory operating rate to be close to its long-run average, despite the still-sizable gap that
exists at that time for aggregate resource utilization.
Compensation and Prices
In light of the reduced amount of labor market slack and higher headline inflation
in this projection, we have boosted our forecast for labor costs. In particular, we now
project that the P&C measure of nonfarm hourly compensation will increase about
2 percent in 2011 and 2½ percent in 2012, about ¼ percentage point faster in both years
than in the January Tealbook; we have made a similar upward adjustment to our forecast
for the ECI. Despite these upward revisions, the projected increases in compensation,
combined with the moderate gains in productivity in our forecast, imply only a small
increase in unit labor costs over the medium term.
After increasing at an annual rate of 4¼ percent in the last quarter of 2010, prices
of imported core goods (all goods excluding fuels, computers, and semiconductors) are
projected to rise 7½ percent in the current quarter, the fastest pace of increase since the
first half of 2008. This jump in core import prices is driven by rising commodity prices,

dollar depreciation, and increased foreign inflation. With more-modest changes in u t
O
commodity prices projected for the second quarter of this year, we expect core import
&
price inflation to move down to 5½ percent. This forecast for the first half of the year is e l
v
e
2 percentage points higher than we had written down in January, mainly because of the D

recent rise in commodity prices. We expect core import price inflation to fall back to o
c

m
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that low levels of resource utilization will
o
D
put downward pressure on core PCE inflation over the projection period, but that further
disinflation will be checked by continued stability in inflation expectations. However,
given the diminished amount of slack in this forecast and the higher prices of energy and
imports, we have raised our estimate of core PCE inflation to 1¼ percent in both 2011
and 2012, up ¼ percentage point in each year from the January Tealbook. We project
that headline PCE price inflation will step down from almost 2 percent in 2011 to just
over 1 percent in 2012, reflecting an anticipated deceleration in energy and food prices.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff forecast to 2015 using the FRB/US model and staff
assessments of long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors. The
contour of the long-run outlook depends on the following key assumptions:
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long
run, consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections
provided by FOMC participants at the January meeting.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities follow the baseline portfolio
projections reported in Book B. The projected decline in the System’s
holdings beginning in the second half of 2012 is forecast to contribute
about 25 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the
2013–15 period.
 Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to
normal levels, and banks ease their lending standards somewhat further.
 The federal government budget deficit narrows to 4¾ percent of GDP by
the end of 2015. This improvement reflects the effects of the economic

 Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declines from 6 percent to
5¼ percent, as the functioning of the labor market improves. Potential
GDP expands 2¾ percent per year.
The economy enters 2013 with the staff’s estimate of the output gap still wide by
historical standards, the unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and
inflation very low. In the long-run projection, improving confidence, diminishing
uncertainty, and supportive financial conditions eventually enable the level of aggregate
demand to catch up with aggregate supply, helping inflation move closer to 2 percent.
Specifically, real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 4¼ percent in 2013 and 2014,
considerably faster than its potential pace; as a result, unemployment declines
appreciably and inflation rises slowly. In response, the federal funds rate gradually
increases to 3¾ percent by late 2014.4 By 2015, with improvements in confidence and
financial conditions largely complete, and with the federal funds rate climbing further to
4¼ percent, gains in real GDP moderate. Nevertheless, overall economic growth remains
robust enough relative to potential to reduce the unemployment rate to the NAIRU by late
2015 while inflation rises to 1¾ percent.
4 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based
rule, which is described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Incoming data on economic activity abroad have been more upbeat than we were
anticipating at the time of the January Tealbook, especially in the euro area, China, and
Mexico. Nevertheless, we see the foreign economies facing greater headwinds as a result
of the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, which has driven up world oil prices
and increased uncertainty about the global recovery. The higher oil prices have also
highlighted concerns about rising inflation, and we now expect a number of central banks
to tighten monetary policy sooner than we previously assumed. Based on these factors,
k
our overall outlook for foreign growth is slightly softer beyond the current quarter than in o
o
l
t
the January Tealbook. We see foreign GDP increasing about 3½ percent this year and u
O
next, propelled by continuing robust growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) &
l
and some firming of activity in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). The possibility e
v
e
that political upheaval will spread further in the Middle East and North Africa poses a D
n
significant downside risk to the global outlook.1 Moreover, vulnerabilities in the euro- o

area periphery stemming from ongoing fiscal and banking stresses continue to be an

important risk to the outlook. I
Foreign consumer price inflation, which increased sharply in both AFEs and
EMEs in the fourth quarter, is estimated to remain elevated in the current quarter, at
4¼ percent, reflecting accelerating energy prices and continued food price increases.2
With upward pressures on oil and other commodity prices projected to subside, foreign
inflation should ease to about 2½ percent late this year. Relative to the January
Tealbook, our outlook for foreign inflation has been revised up somewhat this year
because of the higher path of oil and other commodity prices.
We continue to expect that AFE central banks will keep policy accommodative
over the forecast period but have brought forward their policy rate hikes, as several
central banks have expressed heightened concerns about inflation risks. Although EME
authorities will likely remain cautious about monetary tightening for fear of boosting
capital inflows, we nonetheless anticipate additional rate hikes in these economies as a
response to recent increases in headline inflation and to mitigate the risk of overheating.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
Real GDP in the AFEs expanded at a lackluster pace of 1¾ percent in the fourth
quarter, with activity restrained by adverse weather in Europe and the expiration of
incentives for automobile purchases in Japan. Indicators for the first quarter, such as
industrial production, purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), and retail sales, have been
more upbeat. The greater momentum in the recent data has led us to raise our forecast for
AFE growth in the near term, but further out we have trimmed growth slightly as a result
of higher oil prices. We now expect growth to average only 2 percent over the remainder
of this year and rise to 2½ percent by the end of next year, as the drag from financial
k
o stresses and fiscal consolidation lessens.
o
l
t
u
O
Rising commodity prices pushed up consumer price inflation in the AFEs to an
&
l annual rate of 3½ percent in the fourth quarter, a bit more than we had anticipated in the
e
v
e January Tealbook. With commodity prices even higher now, we revised up our inflation
D
n forecast for the first half of 2011 about ½ percentage point, to 2½ percent. Inflation
o
c
E should gradually subside to about 1½ percent by the end of the year, reflecting our
l
’
n t projection that commodity prices will stabilize and that resource slack will diminish only
I
slowly.
Euro Area
Euro-area GDP grew at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly
less than anticipated in the January Tealbook, reflecting inventory destocking and adverse
effects of severe weather across northern Europe. Recent indicators suggest a pickup in
activity in the current quarter. Retail sales surged in January after contracting for five
consecutive months. In February, the euro-area PMI for manufacturing rose to its highest
level since 2000, and the services PMI climbed further into expansionary territory. The
divergence in economic performance within the euro area remains large, however, with
indicators pointing to relatively vigorous growth in Germany, moderate growth in France
and Italy, weak growth in Ireland and Spain, and contractions of activity in Greece and
Portugal.
We project euro-area GDP growth to rise to 2 percent in the current quarter,
reflecting in part a rebound from weather-related softness. Growth falls to 1¼ percent for
the remainder of this year, held down by higher oil prices, a stronger euro, and monetary
and fiscal policy tightening, before rising to 2½ percent by the end of 2012. In particular,
we expect a subdued recovery of private consumption this year, with higher energy prices

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 9, 2011
draining disposable income and with employment and consumer confidence improving
only slowly. In addition, aggressive fiscal consolidation and persistent financial stresses
should continue to weigh on activity in peripheral euro-area countries.
Euro-area consumer prices rose nearly 2½ percent in February from their year-
earlier level, the third consecutive monthly figure above the European Central Bank’s
(ECB) definition of price stability. We revised up our projection for inflation in the
region somewhat, to 2½ percent this year and 1¾ percent next year, because largely of
recent increases in commodity prices. At its March 3 policy meeting, the ECB kept its
benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent and reaffirmed its commitment to provide
k
o
ample liquidity to banks until, at least, this summer. However, the ECB statement noted
o
l
t
that risks to the outlook for inflation are now distinctly on the upside, and President u
O
Trichet suggested that the ECB may tighten policy as early as April. Accordingly, we &
l
now expect the ECB to begin to raise policy rates in the second quarter of this year, e
v
e
three quarters earlier than assumed in the January Tealbook, with gradual further D
n
increases to a rate of 2 percent by the end of 2012. o
c
E
l
’
t
European Union (EU) leaders have committed to announce a “comprehensive” n
I
policy response to the sovereign debt crisis at their upcoming summit on March 24
and 25. Reportedly, discussions include the possibility of strengthening the existing
facility for emergency lending to distressed governments and easing terms for existing
loans to Ireland and Greece. However, EU leaders currently appear to be far from an
agreement on substantive measures, posing the risk that markets will be disappointed in
the summit’s outcome.
Japan
Japanese real GDP declined at a 1 percent pace in the fourth quarter, as the end of
a government subsidy for automobile purchases in September shifted overall
consumption into reverse. However, readings on industrial production and retail sales in
January suggest that GDP growth has resumed this quarter. Going forward, we anticipate
growth to rise to 2 percent by next year, as improving labor market conditions stimulate
household spending and Japanese exporters benefit from robust demand out of emerging
Asia. This outlook is little changed from the January Tealbook.
Consumer price inflation on a 12-month basis remained zero in January,
supported by higher food and energy prices. However, the end of deflation is likely to be

Economic Risks from the Middle East and North Africa
The global economy faces new risks from the spread of political unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa. Following the relatively peaceful ouster of the leaders of Tunisia and
Egypt in late January and early February, violent clashes erupted in Libya, where fighting
between government forces and the opposition continues. Unrest has also spread—to
varying degrees—to Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Oman, Morocco, and Yemen.
The turmoil has increased global risk concerns, sending equity markets lower and
triggering further capital outflows from emerging market economies. The key economic
risk from unrest in the Middle East and North Africa stems from the region’s importance
k in the world oil market. Other trade and financial linkages to the United States and to the
o
l o world economy are less worrisome.1
t
u
O
& At present, the only significant disruption to oil production has been in Libya, following
e l the violent civil unrest that began in the latter half of February. The size of this disruption
v
e is estimated to be around 1.2 million barrels per day out of Libya’s total productive
D
capacity of 1.8 million barrels per day. Although Saudi Arabia has reportedly increased its
n
o oil output to help make up for this shortfall, spot oil prices are about $15 per barrel above
c
E
mid‐February levels, in part reflecting fears that additional supply disruptions could occur
l
’
n t in the region. Taken together, countries in the Middle East and North Africa (many of
I
which are experiencing protests of some type) produce nearly 30 million barrels of oil per
day (see figure below), equivalent to more than one‐third of world production.
1
The share of the Middle East and North Africa in non‐oil U.S. trade is less than 2 percent, and the
region accounts for about 2 percent of world GDP. As of the end of September 2010, U.S. bank
exposure to the region was only $27 billion, about 3 percent of Tier 1 capital. Bank exposure of Western
Europe was $203 billion, about 9 percent of Tier 1 capital. Large sovereign wealth funds in the region
could pose risks to global financial markets if their holdings were liquidated rapidly, but the probability
of such an outcome seems remote.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 9, 2011
Spare oil production capacity among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), which stood at about 5 million barrels per day as of January (lower‐left
figure), can provide a significant offset to global supply disruptions.2 However, if oil
production is disrupted in other countries as well, this spare production capacity could be
rapidly exhausted.
As Saudi Arabia is the main oil producer in the region—and as it holds the majority of
spare production capacity—a key risk going forward is whether the kingdom will itself
experience political turmoil. In an attempt to preempt unrest, the Saudi monarch
recently announced new social spending programs amounting to $36 billion (8 percent of
GDP). At present, significant unrest in Saudi Arabia appears unlikely. But with an aging
leadership, limited political freedoms, and sectarian tensions, the possibility of upheaval
k
o
in Saudi Arabia should not be discounted completely. In such a scenario, oil prices could o
l
soar to unprecedented levels. u t
O
&
Temporary oil supply disruptions can also be buffered to some degree by drawing down
l
e
oil inventories. Private commercial oil inventories in countries belonging to the v
e
Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) were equivalent to D
58 days of oil consumption at the end of 2010, down somewhat from the very high levels n
o
in mid‐2009 but still above historical norms (lower‐right figure). In addition, strategic c
E
stocks held by governments, including the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, could also ’ l
t
n
be released to manage supply outages. I
Since the January Tealbook, near‐term futures prices for crude oil have moved up by
more than prices for delivery further in the future, suggesting that market participants
expect the current supply dislocations to ease somewhat over time. That said, futures
prices have risen considerably at all maturities, likely reflecting some combination of
diminished expectations for supply, higher expectations for demand, and a larger risk
premium embedded in futures prices.

There is essentially no spare production capacity outside of OPEC.

short lived, given the projected flattening of the path of commodity prices; we project
Japanese consumer prices to decline at an annual rate of about ½ percent for the
remainder of the forecast period.
Canada
Real GDP expanded at a robust pace of 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter, led by a
rebound in commodity exports and strong consumer spending on durables. We look for
GDP growth to step down to about 2½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period,
as the strength of the Canadian dollar provides some drag on net exports and the rise in
k oil prices squeezes households’ disposable income. However, the rise in commodity
o
o
prices should support investment in commodity-producing industries.
l
t
u
O
& Headline inflation stood at 2.3 percent in January on a 12-month basis, pushed up
l
e
v by rising energy prices and hikes in sales taxes. Energy price increases are likely to
e
D
continue to exert upward pressure on headline inflation in the first half of 2011, and, with
n
o
c growth projected to remain solid, we brought forward the next policy rate hike to the
E
’ l third quarter of this year. That said, we believe that the softness of core inflation and the
t
n
I strength of the currency will bring headline inflation back down and keep the
Bank of Canada from tightening monetary policy rapidly, even as the output gap
continues to close.
United Kingdom
Real GDP in the United Kingdom declined at a surprising 2¼ percent pace in the
fourth quarter. Exceptionally bad weather accounted for most of the decline, and a
payback from that factor should help boost growth to 2¾ percent in the current quarter.
Thereafter, our growth forecast averages about 2½ percent, which is slightly softer than
in the January Tealbook in light of higher oil prices and, as noted below, somewhat
tighter monetary policy. Rising commodity prices, higher taxes, and continued pass-
through from the earlier depreciation of sterling pushed 12-month inflation to 4 percent in
January. Inflation should remain elevated in 2011 before falling back to the 2 percent
target in early 2012 as the aforementioned effects dissipate. We brought forward our first
rate hike by the Bank of England to the third quarter of this year, as members of the
Monetary Policy Committee have shown heightened concerns about the risk that inflation
expectations could become unanchored after a prolonged period of above-target inflation.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
Real GDP growth in the EMEs rebounded to 5½ percent in the fourth quarter,
½ percentage point higher than estimated in the January Tealbook. The upward revision
primarily reflects stronger-than-expected growth in China and Mexico. For the EMEs as
a whole, incoming data on industrial production, exports, and PMIs continue to be
upbeat. As with the AFEs, however, stronger near-term momentum is likely to be offset
in part by the global effects of turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, including
deteriorating investor sentiment and rising oil prices (despite the benefit to some EMEs
that export oil). All told, we still see EME growth proceeding at a solid 5 percent pace on
k
average over the forecast period but a bit weaker than in the previous Tealbook. o
o
l
t
u
O
Headline inflation has picked up sharply in the EMEs in recent months. Although
&
this rise has largely been driven by the recent run-up in food prices, in some countries, l
e
v
such as Brazil and China, nonfood inflation has also increased. Moreover, the recent e
D
sharp increase in oil prices should add to inflation pressures. As a result, we revised up n
o
c
our inflation forecast for the EMEs in the current quarter to 5¾ percent. Thereafter, with E
l
’
t
commodity prices projected to flatten out, we see inflation settling down to about n
I
3¼ percent, as in the January Tealbook. This decline in inflation assumes that EME
authorities will continue to tighten monetary policy and allow some moderate exchange
rate appreciation.
China
Revised data show that Chinese real GDP rose 10½ percent in the second half of
last year, nearly 1 percentage point stronger than previously reported. For the current
quarter, we see growth slowing to 9 percent, in line with somewhat lower PMI readings
in January and February. Exports and imports increased sharply in January, with the
trade balance turning to a small deficit. Going forward, we have revised the forecast
down a touch, to a still robust pace of 8½ percent on average over the next two years.
Headline inflation in China edged higher in January, to around 5 percent on a
12-month basis. Moreover, nonfood inflation moved up to about 2½ percent. We see
headline inflation coming down later this year as commodity prices stabilize and credit
growth is reined in. Since late January, Chinese authorities have continued their gradual
tightening of monetary policy, raising both the one-year lending and deposit rates
¼ percentage point and banks’ reserve requirement ratios ½ percentage point. The
renminbi has been flat against the dollar since the previous Tealbook and has appreciated

Food Prices and Foreign Inflation
Food commodity prices have jumped dramatically since mid‐2010, regaining their
2008 peaks, as prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat, among other products,
have surged (see the figures below). These increases are raising headline
inflation, particularly in emerging market economies (EMEs), and are placing an
increased burden on the poor.
Both demand and supply factors are contributing to the food price run‐up. The
global recovery, with especially robust growth in EMEs, has boosted world
demand for food. At the same time, the supply of wheat has been reduced by
k droughts in Russia and Ukraine this past summer and in Argentina, East Africa,
o
o
l and China more recently, as well as excessive and untimely rains last summer in
t
u
O Canada, Europe, and Australia. Likewise, high temperatures in the United States
& led to disappointing corn yields in the fall. Prices for soybeans have also been
e l boosted by poor weather. (Unlike prices for other staple crops, rice prices have
v
e increased only modestly amid record production.) Policy decisions are also
D
raising prices: A few food‐importing countries have made large precautionary
n
o purchases, and some major producing countries have curtailed food exports.
c
E
l
’
n t Barring further supply shocks, there is good reason to expect that food price
I
increases will be more moderate going forward. For corn and soybeans, the
futures markets predict that prices will begin to ease later this year, consistent
with the return of more normal weather conditions and an expansion of the
acreage devoted to these crops. Futures markets currently show wheat prices
increasing but at a more subdued pace over the next year.
For the advanced foreign economies, as for the United States, the jump in food
commodity prices has increased headline inflation only minimally: Consumer
prices for food have risen at about the same pace as overall inflation during the
past year (lower‐left figure on the facing page), although larger increases may
yet come.
Page 42 of 100

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 9, 2011
In contrast, surging crop prices have had a significant effect on consumer prices
for food in the EMEs. These prices jumped nearly 7 percent over the 12 months
ending in January, accounting for most of the increase in EME headline inflation
over the past year (lower‐right figure). The relatively larger effect of food
commodity prices on EME inflation in part reflects the fact that food products
consumed in the EMEs are more heavily weighted toward less processed foods,
the prices of which are influenced more directly by raw commodity prices. In
addition, food products comprise one‐fourth to one‐third of the weight in the
typical EME consumer price index compared with a less than 10 percent weight
for the advanced economies.
The surge in food commodity prices poses challenges for monetary policymakers,
k
o
especially in the EMEs. As output gaps in the EMEs have narrowed, central banks o
l
have struggled to calibrate a pace of monetary tightening that would keep u t
O
inflation in check without attracting substantial capital inflows and inducing
&
unwelcome currency appreciation. Rising food prices further complicate the
l
e
policymaker’s task: Should the commodity boom lose steam, as indicated by v
e
futures markets, monetary policy would have increased room for maneuver. D
Conversely, further shocks to food prices, especially in an environment of n
o
dwindling resource slack, could spill over into inflation expectations, wages, and c
E
core inflation, requiring a step‐up in the pace of monetary tightening. ’ l

about 4 percent since Chinese authorities announced greater flexibility of the exchange
rate in late June. However, on a real trade-weighted basis, the renminbi has depreciated
about 1¾ percent since June.
Other Emerging Asia
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, economic activity in the fourth quarter generally
rebounded from its soft third quarter. This bounceback was particularly evident in the
ASEAN-4 countries. In the current quarter, we expect growth in emerging Asia
excluding China to pick up further. Exports rose significantly in a number of these
economies in January, and industrial production growth was generally positive. Beyond
k
o
o the current quarter, growth holds steady at about 4¾ percent. This outlook is a touch
l
t
u weaker than in the January Tealbook, as the recent rise in commodity prices is likely to
O
& exert some drag on economic activity.
l
e
v
e
D Sharp increases in food prices in December and January boosted overall consumer
n
o prices more rapidly than we had anticipated, and we expect further upward pressure in
c
E
the near term after the recent jump in oil prices. Barring additional increases in
l
’
t
n
commodity prices, spillovers to nonfood inflation should generally remain contained, and
I
we expect inflation to moderate later this year. We assume that central banks will
continue to withdraw monetary stimulus, albeit at a restrained pace, while allowing some
moderate further currency appreciation, in line with projected movements in the
renminbi.
Latin America
We now estimate that real GDP in Latin America rose at an annual rate of
4¼ percent in the fourth quarter, about 1¼ percentage points faster than we projected in
the January Tealbook. This upward revision reflects stronger-than-expected growth of
5 percent in Mexico, where both industrial output and the services sector grew solidly, as
labor market conditions improved. Brazilian growth in the fourth quarter, at 3 percent,
was a bit lower than we had anticipated; consumption was strong, but investment
spending slowed significantly. We have boosted our forecast for Latin American growth
this quarter and next, to about 4¼ percent, reflecting strong incoming data for Mexico. In
the remainder of the forecast period, growth holds steady at about 4 percent, a little lower
than in the previous outlook on account of the weaker outlook for U.S. manufacturing
production. With Latin America being a net exporter of commodities, the recent
Page 44 of 100

increases in the price of oil and other commodities should not restrain activity for the
region as a whole.
Headline inflation has eased a bit in Mexico recently, with the 12-month rate
edging below the upper end of the central bank’s 2 to 4 percent target range in January.
But this decline entirely reflects the passing out of last year’s rise in sales taxes and
administered prices from the 12-month inflation calculation; in recent quarters, inflation
has picked up. In Brazil, 12-month inflation rose to 6 percent in February. In addition to
commodity price increases, higher inflation in Brazil is being driven by continued lax
fiscal policy and rapid consumer credit growth, pointing to possible overheating of the
k
o
economy. In response, the Brazilian central bank raised its target policy rate
o
l
t
50 basis points to 11.75 percent in early March. The policy rate has been raised a u
O
cumulative 300 basis points since early last year. &

Financial Developments
Market participants appeared to read the incoming economic data over the
intermeeting period as somewhat better than expected, but the escalation of unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and the consequent rise in oil prices have
weighed on market sentiment since mid-February. Over the period as a whole, the
expected policy path shifted up beyond the one-year horizon, yields on nominal Treasury
securities increased about 10 to 30 basis points, broad stock price indexes posted modest
gains, and risk spreads on corporate bonds narrowed moderately. TIPS-based inflation
compensation at the five-year horizon increased notably amid rising oil prices, while
measures of forward inflation compensation beyond the five-year horizon increased
considerably less. Conditions in short-term funding markets were little changed over the
intermeeting period. The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar
declined about 1 percent, as relatively good incoming macroeconomic data for Europe,
combined with prospective tightening of monetary policy by several foreign central
banks, appeared to outweigh the effects of flight-to-safety flows related to concerns about
the MENA region.
Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations moderated a bit but stayed robust in the s
t
n
first two months of 2011. Indicators of business and consumer credit quality continued to e
m
p
improve. However, financing conditions for commercial real estate generally remained o
l
e
tight. In addition, house prices continued to decline, reflecting the large inventory of v
e
D
unsold homes, still-tight financing conditions, and perhaps households’ concern that
l
a
i
house prices might fall further. c

Bank credit declined, on average, in January and February because of a
contraction in core loans, while holdings of securities were about flat. Bank profitability
improved somewhat further in the fourth quarter of 2010, but the increase was
attributable to reduced loan loss provisioning rather than higher revenues. Responses to
the March 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms
(SCOOS) indicated an easing of price and nonprice credit terms for a wide range of
counterparties over the past three months (see appendix). M2 expanded moderately in
the first two months of 2011, mainly because of continued robust growth in liquid
deposits.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
The January FOMC statement was largely in line with market expectations and
elicited only a modest market reaction, although the characterization of the economic
outlook was reportedly marginally less optimistic than some investors had anticipated.1
Over the weeks following the FOMC meeting, policy expectations moved higher, as
market participants read the incoming economic data as somewhat better than expected,
on balance, and viewed the minutes of the January FOMC meeting as slightly more
upbeat about the strength of the economic expansion than the FOMC statement.
However, since mid-February, policy expectations have retraced a portion of their earlier
rise amid concerns about the possible economic fallout from the escalation of unrest in
the MENA region. The flatter policy path may have been reinforced by Chairman
Bernanke’s semiannual monetary policy testimony, which market participants reportedly
interpreted as emphasizing that the current stance of monetary policy would likely be
maintained for some time.
On net, both the mean and modal paths of the expected federal funds rate shifted
higher beyond the one-year horizon. Futures quotes, combined with the staff’s usual
assumption about term premiums, suggest that market participants’ mean expected path
for the federal funds rate rises above the current target range during the first quarter of
s 2012 and reaches about 1.5 percent two years from now. The modal policy path derived
t
n
e from quotes on interest rate caps moves above the current target range in the second
m
p
quarter of 2012, one quarter earlier than at the time of the most recent FOMC meeting.

i
F was unchanged at $600 billion, although the range of estimates across dealers narrowed
considerably. Dealers revised up slightly their forecasts for economic growth and
inflation in the current and next two years, and they revised down their outlook for the
unemployment rate over the same period.
Intermediate- and longer-term Treasury yields generally followed a pattern
similar to those of policy expectations. Yields rose strongly early in the period but
subsequently retraced those gains, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields ending the period up 13,
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

27, and 20 basis points, respectively. The decline in yields since mid-February seemed to
reflect, in part, flight-to-safety flows; yields dropped appreciably on days when stock
prices fell, and staff term premium estimates declined as well. Market-based measures of
uncertainty about long-term Treasury yields ended the period slightly lower on net.
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next 5 years rose 32 basis points, on
net, over the intermeeting period. Most of the increase was concentrated at the front end
of the curve, mainly reflecting the jump in oil prices resulting from the political unrest in
the MENA region, as well as slightly stronger-than-expected January PPI and CPI data.
Inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was up only 14 basis points over the
intermeeting period. Staff models attribute about one-half of this increase to a rise in
expected inflation. Forward inflation compensation derived from inflation swaps also
increased 14 basis points. Measures of short- and long-term inflation expectations from
the Thomson Reuters/Michigan survey rose a bit, while those from the Survey of
Professional Forecasters were unchanged.
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Broad stock price indexes rose about 2½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting
period. Stock prices trended up through mid-February, reportedly as investors read the
incoming economic data as somewhat better than expected, on balance, and as corporate
s
t
n
earnings reports continued to come in above analysts’ forecasts. However, the escalation
e
m
p of political turmoil in the MENA region weighed on stock prices over the past few
o
l
e weeks. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose sharply in mid-February
v
e
D from about 16 percent to about 23 percent and has since remained somewhat elevated at
l
a

n
a return for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year Treasury yield—a measure of the equity
n
i
F risk premium—narrowed a touch more over the period but continued to be quite elevated
by historical standards.
Spreads of yields on BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds relative to
those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities declined 10 basis points and 33 basis
points, respectively, over the intermeeting period. The modest narrowing of corporate
bond spreads reflected substantial declines in near-term forward spreads, consistent with
a more upbeat assessment of the near-term outlook for corporate credit quality. Far-term
forward spreads for speculative-grade bonds remained near the bottom of their range over

the past two decades. In the secondary market for syndicated leveraged loans, the
average bid price continued to increase.
Conditions in short-term funding markets were little changed over the
intermeeting period. Overnight rates on federal funds, general collateral repos, and
Eurodollars moved slightly lower, on balance, while rates at other tenors were roughly
flat (see box “Recent Developments in Overnight Money Market Rates”). Near-term
spreads of dollar Libor over comparable-maturity OIS rates continued to edge higher, but
forward measures of dollar funding pressures were little changed. Thirty-day spreads of
yields on both A2/P2-rated nonfinancial commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP over
rates on AA-rated nonfinancial paper remained low. In addition, haircuts in the repo
market edged down, on balance, across most collateral types.
In the March 2011 SCOOS, dealers reported a further easing in price and nonprice
terms across different counterparty types over the past three months for all transaction
categories covered in the survey (see appendix). Dealers also noted that demand for
funding had increased for a broad range of securities over the same period. Despite these
changes, measures of activity in a number of funding markets (for example, the triparty
repo market) remained well below levels seen prior to the financial crisis. In response to
special questions, dealers reported an increase in the use of leverage over the past six
s months by traditionally unlevered investors—in particular, asset managers, insurance
t
n
e
m companies, and pension funds. Dealers also noted that increased leverage was

loans have remained robust, as borrowers have refinanced a substantial volume of loans
originally issued in 2010. Demand for this asset class by retail investors has shown no
signs of abating since the beginning of the year, contributing to a further narrowing of
credit spreads, an erosion of traditional maintenance covenants, and a gradual rise in the
leverage embedded in buyout transactions.

Recent Developments in Overnight Money Market Rates
Since the beginning of the year, some key overnight money market rates have
declined somewhat relative to the interest rate paid on excess reserves (the
IOER rate). As shown in the figure below, the February averages for the
overnight federal funds, Treasury general collateral (GC) repo, and Eurodollar
rates were 3 to 6 basis points lower than their average values in the fourth
quarter of last year. This recent softening in rates likely reflects in part the
ongoing large‐scale asset purchases (LSAPs) and the decline of balances in the
Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account (SFA), both of which have
boosted the quantity of reserves in the banking system and reduced the
available supply of collateral in the repo market. These factors are expected to
continue to put downward pressure on overnight rates in coming months. A
forthcoming change to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance
assessments is expected to further depress overnight rates relative to the rate
paid on excess reserves, although the size of the effect is uncertain.
The ongoing LSAPs by the Federal Reserve and the decline in the Treasury’s SFA
would tend to affect money markets in the same way, so separating the effects

of the two changes is difficult. Since the beginning of 2011, the Federal Reserve
has purchased about $230 billion of Treasury securities, of which about
$50 billion have been reinvestments of payments of principal on agency debt
and agency mortgage‐backed securities; in addition, over recent weeks,
Treasury bills issued to fund the SFA have declined by $125 billion. These factors
have contributed to an increase in reserve balances of about $340 billion.
Although estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, the declines in
overnight rates this year are consistent with results from econometric models
of the relationship between money market rates, reserve balances, and the
amounts of repo collateral outstanding.
The upcoming modification of the FDIC premium assessment base could put
further downward pressure on overnight rates relative to the IOER rate.1 While
the FDIC previously assessed premiums only on domestic deposits, the new
rule, effective April 1, 2011, effectively expands the assessment base to banks’
total liabilities, raising the dollar amount of the assessment base by over 50
percent.2 Notably, the new regulation does not exempt federal funds
purchased from the assessment base, increasing the implicit cost of borrowing
in the federal funds market. Given the substantial amount of reserve balances
in the banking system, it seems that most borrowing in the federal funds
market likely is motivated by the ability to earn the IOER rate at a spread above
s
the market federal funds rate. The new regulation would, all else being equal, t
n
make this arbitrage more costly, pushing down the rate at which banks would e
m
be willing to borrow funds in order to earn the IOER rate. The effect of the p
o
modified FDIC premium assessment base on the federal funds rate is uncertain, e l
v
but some industry estimates suggest a decline in the federal funds rate in the e
D
range of 2 to 5 basis points.

The new Basel liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which is slated to become effective in
2015, could be another factor introducing a wedge between money market rates and the
IOER rate. To the extent that banks respond to the LCR by lengthening the term of their
funding, demand for overnight funding may decline, pushing down overnight rates.
Although market contacts have not suggested that the current softness in overnight money
market rates is related to the LCR given the substantial time until the implementation date of
the new requirement, banks could begin to shift their funding patterns in advance of the
actual implementation date. This adjustment could be incremental, so discerning a specific
effect on market rates may be difficult even if the ultimate effect is significant.
2
The assessment continues to be applied only to FDIC‐insured institutions. As the
assessment is meant to be revenue‐neutral, the FDIC is lowering average marginal premiums.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was relatively subdued in
January and February. In the fourth quarter, gross equity issuance had increased, but
equity retirements from share repurchases and cash-financed mergers had risen more
strongly, pushing net equity issuance a bit further into negative territory. Recent
announcements of cash-financed mergers and new share repurchase programs suggest
that the pace of net equity retirements will increase further in the current quarter.
The majority of fourth-quarter earnings reports came in over the intermeeting
period. For the earnings season as a whole, the ratio of positive earnings surprises to
negative surprises was nearly 3 to 1, comparable to the average ratio in the past few
quarters. Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms appear to have grown about
5 percent in the fourth quarter. Despite the generally favorable news, over the four weeks
ending in mid-February, analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms
were little changed on balance.
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to improve. In the fourth
quarter, the ratio of aggregate liquid assets to total assets for nonfinancial corporations
remained near its record high, while the aggregate debt-to-asset ratio declined a bit. In
January and February, upgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds by Moody’s Investors
Service again outpaced downgrades, and the six-month trailing bond default rate for
nonfinancial firms remained close to zero. Meanwhile, the C&I loan delinquency rate s
t
n
fell to 3 percent in the fourth quarter, its lowest level in two years. The expected default e
m
p
rate for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV declined a little in January and February, o

in part reflecting higher estimated asset valuations. v

tight in 2011. Delinquency rates on loans in pools of commercial mortgage-backed
securities (CMBS) edged up to a record high in February. However, in the fourth quarter,
delinquency rates on commercial mortgages at life insurance companies and at banks
ticked down from elevated levels. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2011, issuance of
CMBS, which are often used to finance large existing properties in strong markets, is
estimated to have about maintained its modest fourth-quarter pace. Data through the end
of 2010 suggest that prices of investment-grade commercial real estate have stabilized at
low levels, while those of other types of commercial real estate have continued to decline.

HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Mortgage rates rose about in line with yields on longer-term Treasury securities
over the intermeeting period, leaving their spreads roughly unchanged. Nonetheless, with
conforming mortgage rates remaining close to 5 percent—about 70 basis points above
their lows last fall—refinancing activity was tepid.
House prices continued to decrease, reflecting the large inventory of unsold
homes, still-tight financing conditions, and perhaps households’ concern that house prices
might fall further. According to the repeat-sales index from CoreLogic, house prices fell
at an annual rate of about 6 percent in January—the eighth consecutive monthly decline.
Mortgage debt is estimated to have fallen again in the fourth quarter, while rates of
serious delinquency—defined as the percentage of mortgage loans that are in the
foreclosure process or at least 90 days delinquent—for subprime and prime mortgages
were little changed in December and January, respectively, at levels a little below their
prior peaks.
Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in January. As was the
case in the prior quarter, nonrevolving credit increased while revolving credit ran off.
Delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools and on auto loans at finance

region and the subsequent spike in oil prices dominated the news in global financial
markets, raising concerns about global growth prospects and causing some flight-to-
safety flows. However, better-than-expected foreign macroeconomic data provided some
offset to the negative news.
Advanced economy equity prices, which had been rising for most of the
intermeeting period, nearly reversed their earlier gains, as oil prices rose with the
escalation of political turmoil in Libya and the associated disruptions to oil production.

ended the period little changed. Emerging market equity funds continued to experience
outflows.
Ten-year sovereign bond yields in Europe and Canada climbed early in the
intermeeting period but reversed most of those increases as tensions in the MENA region
mounted. Inflation compensation rose in these economies, with most of the increase
concentrated in the near term and likely reflecting the spike in oil prices. The European
Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at its March meeting.
However, during the press conference following the meeting, ECB president Trichet
noted that “strong vigilance” would be needed in light of upside risks to inflation, leading
market participants to expect a policy rate hike at the April meeting. Market expectations
of overnight policy rates at the end of 2011 in the euro area and the United Kingdom
increased 35 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period,
while expectations for policy rates in Canada and Japan were little changed.
Facing more immediate inflation pressures, authorities in several emerging market
economies (EMEs) acted to tighten policy over the period. Policymakers in China again
raised reserve requirements and announced several new measures to cool domestic
property markets. Russia and Turkey also raised their reserve requirements, and the
central banks of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Indonesia increased their policy rates.

n
Yield spreads on the 10-year sovereign bonds of Greece relative to German bunds e
m
increased 135 basis points, while those of Ireland and Portugal moved up about 50 basis p
o
l
points over the period. Moody’s reduced Greece’s credit rating three notches to B1, and e
v
e
S&P downgraded several Portuguese government-linked enterprises. The increases in D
l
a
spreads may also have reflected concerns that European leaders will fail to agree on an i
c
n
expansion of the European Union’s financial assistance facilities sufficient to backstop a
n
i
F
peripheral Europe. Even so, spreads on Spanish and Italian bonds were little changed.
Despite the flight-to-safety flows related to concerns about the MENA region, the
broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined about 1 percent over the period. The
dollar fell only modestly against most EME currencies but depreciated 1½ percent
against the euro, likely owing to relatively good incoming macro news from Europe and
market perceptions that the ECB will begin raising policy rates sooner than had been
previously expected.

Foreign official purchases of U.S. securities were weak in December and January,
but data on custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that they
picked up notably in February. In particular, foreign official acquisitions of Treasury
securities resumed in February, likely reflecting in part investments of proceeds from
foreign exchange intervention. In addition, official investors acquired moderate amounts
of agency securities in both January and February, reversing the trend of net sales of
these securities over the second half of last year.
Official published estimates on foreign holdings of U.S. debt, released at the
beginning of this month, showed that China held $1.16 trillion in Treasury securities at
the end of December 2010, substantially more than the previous official estimate of
$892 billion. The revised figures were in line with internal estimates.
GOVERNMENT FINANCE
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned $267 billion of nominal
coupon securities across the maturity spectrum as well as $9 billion of 30-year TIPS; its
auction sizes were unchanged. Overall, the auctions were well received, with bid-to-
cover ratios close to recent averages. The 10-year note and 30-year TIPS auctions
registered very high shares awarded to indirect bidders, suggesting robust demand from
foreign official institutions. As previously announced, to provide flexibility in debt
s
t
management, the Treasury began to allow Treasury bills that fund balances in the n
e
m
Supplementary Financing Account (SFA) held at the Federal Reserve to run off as total p
o
federal debt outstanding approaches the statutory debt limit (see box “Balance Sheet e l

general obligation bonds fell notably, leaving their ratios to yields on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities and to those on AAA-rated corporate bonds narrower but
still elevated by historical standards. Issuance of long-term municipal bonds was modest
in January and February following extremely robust issuance in the fourth quarter as the
end of the Build America Bond program neared. Issuance of short-term municipal
securities has been muted so far this year, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
Total assets of the Federal Reserve increased by $128 billion over the
intermeeting period to reach a level of about $2.6 trillion (see table on facing
page). The Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchase program boosted
outright securities holdings by $128 billion.
The Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducted
26 operations to purchase longer‐term Treasury securities since the January
meeting. The operations, which covered a range of maturities for nominal
securities as well as 3 operations in TIPS, totaled $143 billion.1 To provide
flexibility in conducting the asset purchase program, the Desk temporarily
relaxed its per issue limit on System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of
individual Treasury issues late last year; SOMA holdings of 40 individual issues
now exceed 35 percent of the total outstanding for each issue, and SOMA
holdings of 5 issues exceed 50 percent. Cases in which SOMA holdings exceed
50 percent of the total outstanding are all high‐coupon 30‐year bonds with a
remaining maturity between 4 and 10 years.
Loans outstanding under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)
fell about $3 billion over the intermeeting period, reflecting additional
prepayments of TALF loans. The net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC,
t s Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC were little changed. Finally,
n
e foreign central bank liquidity swaps fell to zero from an already very low level.
m
p
o
l On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, Federal Reserve
e
v
e notes in circulation expanded by a substantial $23 billion over the period, likely
D
boosted by strong international demand for U.S. banknotes. The Treasury’s
l
a
i general account, which is volatile from month to month, decreased $59 billion,
c
n
on net, and balances in the Treasury’s supplementary financing account fell by
a
n
i $125 billion to about $75 billion. The Treasury has allowed bills that fund
F
balances in the supplementary financing account to roll off in order to provide
greater flexibility in debt management as total Federal debt outstanding
approaches the statutory debt limit. Term deposits increased to $5 billion as
another small‐value Term Deposit Facility offering settled on February 10; it will
mature on March 10. Reflecting these factors and the effects of the asset
purchase program, reserve balances of depository institutions rose $284 billion
over the intermeeting period.
1
These operations include purchases conducted between January 27, 2011, and March 7,
2011. During this period total settlements were $137 billion.

The Municipal Bond Market
The municipal bond market is used by state and local governments and their authorities
to raise money for schools, highways, utilities, hospitals, and other public infrastructure.
About $3 trillion of municipal bonds are outstanding, with over 50,000 borrowers; and
the median deal size at issuance over the past decade was only $6 million.1 This vastly
diverse composition creates a rather illiquid market, where disclosure is limited and
trading is decentralized. Moreover, relatively unsophisticated retail investors hold a
dominate share of outstanding securities in this market, either through direct holdings or
ownership of shares in tax‐exempt mutual funds.2
Over the past few months, tax‐exempt mutual funds have experienced unusually large
net outflows, on balance, as persistent concerns about the credit risk of municipal bonds
were exacerbated by negative publicity. However, some of the outflows probably were
induced by rising interest rates, which drove down returns in such funds. Indeed, net
outflows from federal government bond mutual funds, returns in which tend to move
inversely with interest rates, have also been heavy.

Of the roughly $3 trillion in outstanding municipal securities, about $2.5 trillion represents debt of
state and local governments. The remainder represents industrial revenue bonds and the debt of some
nonprofits.
2
About one‐third of municipal securities are held directly by households and one‐sixth by mutual
funds. The secondary market of municipal bonds is also opaque due to its over‐the‐counter nature,
despite significant improvements in trading transparency in recent years. In addition, tax and contract
laws governing municipal bonds vary significantly across states, contributing to the market inefficiency.

Conditions in the municipal bond market appear to have improved significantly over the
past several weeks. The pace of net outflows from municipal funds has slowed in recent
weeks (see the lower‐left figure on the facing page). The ratios of yields on long‐term
general obligation municipal bonds to those on comparable‐maturity Treasury securities
and to those on AAA‐rated corporate bonds spiked toward the end of 2010 amid surging
issuance of Build America Bonds before the program expired by year end (see the lower‐
right figure on the facing page). However, yield ratios have fallen sharply since Illinois
substantially raised the state’s personal and corporate income tax rates in mid‐January,
an event that apparently made investors more confident that most issuers would take
necessary measures to address their fiscal imbalances.
The recent improvements have been broad based. On net, credit default swap spreads
for most of the major municipal bond issuers have more than retraced the spikes that
occurred late last year (see the lower‐left figure below). For most issuers, the municipal
bond market appears to have remained receptive.
Despite these improvements, substantial concerns remain over the credit quality of
municipal bonds. Yield ratios continue to be high by historical standards. Also,
downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s again outpaced upgrades during the fourth
quarter of 2010 (see the lower‐right figure below). Municipal bond defaults are expected
to pick up somewhat in the next few years after having come down from their recent
peak in 2008. Even so, the rate of defaults is expected to remain fairly low.

COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
Bank credit declined at an annual rate of about 2½ percent, on average, over
January and February, reflecting a contraction in core loans, while holdings of securities
were about flat. C&I loans increased about 3 percent, on average, over the two months.
In contrast, commercial real estate loans decreased, although the rate of the decline was
somewhat below the pace of contraction in the second half of 2010. Closed-end
residential mortgage loans, which had grown for five consecutive months at the end of
last year, fell a bit in January and more substantially in February, reportedly owing
mostly to a significant slowing in the pace of originations. Banks indicated that loan
sales to the GSEs continued at about the heavy pace of the previous few months. Home
equity loans and consumer loans also declined in the first two months of 2011.2
The Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of
February showed that, at domestic banks, the weighted-average spread of the rate on C&I
loans of less than $25 million over Eurodollar and swap rates of comparable maturity
decreased noticeably in the first quarter but remained elevated. Spreads declined most
notably at small domestic banks, which were responsible for about 10 percent of the
gross loan originations in the most recent survey.
The fourth-quarter Call Report data, on a seasonally adjusted basis, showed a
s
t
n
further rise in bank profitability, although aggregate profits remained somewhat below
e
m
p pre-crisis levels. Profitability was again supported by reduced loan loss provisioning
o
l
e rather than improved revenues, as pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue decreased. The
v
e
D decline in loss provisioning was consistent with improvements in broad measures of
l
a
i credit quality, but net charge-offs nonetheless continued to exceed provisioning.
c
n
a Regulatory capital ratios generally increased further, although the pace of increase
n
i
F appears to have ebbed somewhat at larger banks. Unused home equity lines of credit and
credit card lines continued to shrink in the fourth quarter, but unused commitments to
fund C&I loans rose somewhat for the second consecutive quarter.
2 The large decline in consumer loans other than credit cards has mostly reflected two changes in
the seasonal pattern of loan disbursements relative to recent years. First, rulings by the IRS and the OCC
stifled banks’ issuance of refund anticipation loans this year, which would normally have fueled other
consumer loans. Second, student loans had usually been disbursed by banks in January, but the federal
government is now making a substantial share of these loans. Not seasonally adjusted, this category
decreased only slightly over the past two months.

M2 grew at a moderate annual rate of 5 percent, on average, over January and
February. Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, expanded at about a 9½ percent
annual rate over the same period, down from the 13 percent pace posted in the fourth
quarter of 2010. Small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds contracted
further over the first two months of the year. As has been the case for some time, the
compositional shift within M2 toward liquid deposits likely reflects their higher yields
relative to other M2 components. Currency advanced at a notable 8½ percent annual rate
over January and February, likely boosted by strong growth in foreign holdings of U.S.
bank notes as weather-related transportation difficulties, which delayed previous
shipments, abated and as several regions experiencing political unrest turned to the safety
of U.S. dollars. The monetary base expanded at a 60 percent annual rate in the first two
months of the year as both the Desk’s ongoing purchases of Treasury securities and the
Treasury’s reduction of the SFA balance in February boosted reserve balances.

Appendix
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms
Overall, respondents to the March 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer
Financing Terms indicated a further easing in credit terms across different counterparty types and
securities financing transactions over the previous three months.1 Dealers also noted an increase
in demand for funding for all types of securities considered in the survey over the same period.
By contrast, respondents generally reported little change in the terms and conditions prevailing in
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.2
• Dealers reported that they had eased credit terms, on net, for each counterparty type
covered in the survey. The most important reason cited for easing terms was more-
aggressive competition from other institutions. Other factors cited included an
improvement in the current or expected financial strength of counterparties and an
improvement in general market liquidity and functioning. Respondents again reported an
increase in the intensity of efforts by clients in each major class to negotiate more-
favorable terms.
• Similar to the December survey, the majority of respondents indicated that the amount of
resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and
other financial intermediaries had remained basically unchanged over the past three
months. One-fourth of respondents, however, did point to an increase.

credit terms and conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets. In addition to the core set n
a
of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about the use of leverage by traditionally n
i
unlevered investors during the past six months; a special question on the use of leverage by hedge funds F
pursuing specific investment strategies during the past six months; another set of special questions
regarding third-party custody of independent amounts (initial margin) and collateral; and a final set of
special questions about dealers’ exposure to states, localities, and other issuers of tax-exempt debt. The
20 institutions participating in the survey provide almost all dealer financing of dollar-denominated
securities to nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was
conducted during the period from February 14, 2011, to February 25, 2011. The core questions ask about
changes between December 2010 and February 2010.
2 For questions that ask about credit terms, reported net percentages equal the percentage of
institutions that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably” or “tightened somewhat”) minus the
percentage of institutions that reported easing terms (“eased considerably” or “eased somewhat”). For
questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions that reported
increased demand (“increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions
that reported decreased demand (“decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”).

fractions of dealers noted that they had eased certain nonprice terms with regard to total
return swaps (TRS) with nonsecurities (such as bank loans) as the underlying.3
• Dealers reported that they had eased some terms on securities financing transactions on
each type of collateral considered in the survey, with the most pronounced easing being
for asset-backed securities (ABS) other than agency residential mortgage-backed
securities (RMBS).
• Dealers noted that demand for funding of all types of securities covered in the survey had
increased over the past three months.
• In response to a set of special questions, a number of dealers indicated that traditionally
unlevered investors (asset managers, insurance companies, and pension funds) increased
somewhat their use of leverage over the past six months. Respondents reported that the
preferred products used to generate leverage were OTC derivatives and repurchase
agreements (repos).
• In response to a special question about changes in the use of leverage by hedge funds
pursuing different investment strategies, dealers indicated that the increase in leverage
was widespread across funds pursuing the strategies listed in the survey. The increase in
leverage was reported to be the greatest among funds focused on fixed-income arbitrage,
followed by those pursuing credit-trading strategies and global-macro.
• In response to special questions about whether institutions’ clients have sought to arrange
for third-party custody of independent amounts (initial margin) and other collateral
s
t
n postings, only a small number of dealers indicated that this issue is a significant and

resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other

financial intermediaries had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, although
one-fourth of respondents pointed to an increase. The majority of respondents also noted that the
volume of mark and collateral disputes with dealers and other financial intermediaries had
remained basically unchanged over the previous three months, with one-fifth of dealers reporting
a decrease.4
Hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar private pools of capital
As has been true for the past three surveys, the responses indicated that, across all types
of transactions covered in the survey, dealers had eased somewhat the credit terms they provide to
hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar private pools of capital (private pools of
capital) over the past three months. About one-third of respondents, on net, eased somewhat their
price terms such as financing rates. A similar net fraction of institutions reported having eased
nonprice terms such as haircuts, maximum maturities, covenants, cure periods, and cross-default
provisions or other documentation features. The institutions that reported having eased terms
pointed to more-aggressive competition from other institutions, an improvement in the current or
expected financial strength of counterparties, and an improvement in general market liquidity and
functioning as the main reasons for the changes.5 Nearly two-thirds of dealers noted an increase
in the intensity of efforts by private pools of capital to negotiate more-favorable price and
nonprice terms over the past three months. Looking forward over the next three months, one-half
of the respondents to the March survey, on balance, indicated that they anticipated a further
easing of terms for such counterparties.
Insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors
The survey responses indicated that dealers also provided more-favorable credit terms for
s
t
n
insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors (institutional investors). A
e
m
small net fraction of respondents reported having eased price terms over the past three months,
p
o
while one-fourth of dealers noted an easing of nonprice terms over the same period. As was the l
e
v
case for private pools of capital, the most important reason indicated for easing terms was more- e
D
aggressive competition from other institutions. Improvements in the current or expected financial
l
a
strength of counterparties and improvement in general market liquidity and functioning were also i
c
n
cited as important reasons for the change. About one-third of dealers reported an increase in the a
n
intensity of efforts by institutional investors to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms F i
over the past three months. Looking forward over the next three months, about one-third of
respondents, on balance, expected credit terms applicable to institutional investors to ease
somewhat.
4 A rise in the volume of mark and collateral disputes is generally viewed as a leading indicator of
market stress.
5 An ordinal ranking of reasons for loosening or tightening is produced by adding the number of
respondents characterizing each reason as “very important” to the number characterizing the reason as
“somewhat important” and then sorting the sums in descending order. For reasons with the same ranking
based on the sums, the response that the greater number of dealers characterizes as “very important” takes
priority.

Nonfinancial corporations
The responses to questions about credit terms applicable to nonfinancial corporations also
pointed to an easing over the past three months. Nearly one-third of respondents, on balance,
indicated that they had eased price terms, while a small net fraction of dealers also noted an
easing of nonprice terms. As was the case for private pools of capital and institutional investors,
the most important reason cited for easing terms for nonfinancial corporations was more-
aggressive competition from other institutions, followed by the improvement in current or
expected financial strength of counterparties. About one-third of respondents indicated that there
had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate more-
favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months. Looking forward over the next
three months, one-fifth of dealers, on balance, indicated that they anticipated somewhat looser
terms for these counterparties.
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES
As in the previous three surveys, responses to questions dealing with OTC derivatives
trades generally pointed to little change over the past three months in most of the terms for “plain
vanilla” and customized derivatives across the various underlyings—foreign exchange, interest
rates, equities, credit, commodities, and TRS referencing nonsecurities. However, about one-
fourth of respondents indicated that they had tightened somewhat initial margins (for highly
customized derivatives) and requirements, timelines, and thresholds for posting additional
margins (for both plain vanilla and highly customized derivatives) on trades with foreign
exchange as the underlying. In addition, with regard to TRS with nonsecurities as the underlying,
about one-third of dealers active in this market, on net, reported having eased somewhat initial
s
t
n margin requirements, while one-fifth of respondents noted that they had increased somewhat their
e

p

most-favored clients over the past three months. With regard to terms under which high-grade

30 percent reported an increase in the maximum amount of funding, an extension in the
maximum maturity, a reduction in the financing rate, and a decrease in haircuts. With respect to

maximum amount of funding, extended the maximum maturity, and eased covenants and triggers.
Regarding terms under which agency RMBS are funded, net portions of respondents ranging
between about 20 and 30 percent noted that they had decreased haircuts and financing rates,
extended the maximum maturity, and increased the maximum amount of funding. Finally, with
respect to terms under which ABS other than agency RMBS are funded, net fractions of dealers
ranging between about 20 and 55 percent reported an increase in the maximum amount of
funding, a decrease in haircuts, an extension in the maximum maturity, and a decrease in the
financing rate.
Survey respondents indicated that demand for funding for all types of securities
considered in the survey had increased over the past three months. Notably, demand for funding
for ABS other than agency RMBS was reported to have increased by 80 percent of survey
participants. More than one-half of dealers noted an increase in demand for funding for agency
RMBS, while about one-third of survey respondents that lend against high-grade corporate bonds
and equities indicated that demand for such funding had increased.
Respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning in several markets had continued to
improve over the past three months.8 Nearly 60 percent of dealers reported an improvement in
markets for ABS other than agency RMBS, while 40 percent of respondents noted an
improvement in the high-grade corporate bond market. Nearly one-fifth of dealers, on balance,
pointed to an improvement in liquidity and functioning in the agency RMBS market.
Survey respondents generally reported that the volume of collateral and mark disputes
with clients related to the funding of collateral of all types had remained unchanged.

The low interest rates that have prevailed in recent quarters have posed particular e

challenges to investors who, because of their investment goals or liability structure, effectively

have nominal return targets. A set of special questions asked dealers about the degree to which c i
n
their clients who traditionally employ little or no financial leverage and face such challenges have a
n
i
sought to boost returns through the use of leverage over the past six months. The questions also F
asked about the specific mechanisms employed in such instances. About one-third of respondents
indicated that asset managers (acting on behalf of holders of separately managed accounts) have
increased somewhat their use of leverage over the reference period, while nearly one-fifth of
dealers noted that insurance companies and pension funds have also done so. The most important
exposure mechanisms and transaction types used to attain such leverage over the past six months,
according to survey respondents, were OTC derivatives (including TRS) and repos. Some dealers
also pointed to margin loans and, to a smaller extent, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as vehicles

market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repos and similar secured financing transactions,
not changes in the funding market itself.

by which traditionally unlevered investors have attained higher degrees of leverage over the
reference period.9
SPECIAL QUESTION ON THE USE OF LEVERAGE BY HEDGE FUNDS
A special question sought information from dealers regarding possible changes during the
past six months in the amounts of leverage applied by their hedge fund clients pursuing various
investment strategies. Respondents reported that the increase in the use of leverage was
widespread across hedge funds pursuing the strategies listed in the survey. In particular, more
than one-half of dealers indicated that fixed-income arbitrage hedge funds increased their use of
leverage over the past six months, while about 45 percent of respondents noted that credit trading
hedge funds and global macro funds had done so.
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON THIRD-PARTY CUSTODY OF INDEPENDENT AMOUNTS
(INITIAL MARGIN) AND COLLATERAL
Following the financial crisis, market participants have reportedly become more
concerned about the possible consequences of financial distress on the part of a dealer with whom
they have posted collateral pursuant to OTC derivatives transactions, securities financings, or
other activities. A set of special questions explored the intensity with which clients have sought
to arrange for third-party custody of such collateral as a risk mitigant. In addition, these questions
sought information concerning the classes of clients that have most actively pursued this option in
negotiations with dealers. Although 40 percent of respondents indicated that the issue has arisen
in some discussions with current and potential new clients and about one-third noted that the
s issue has occasionally arisen in such discussions, only a small number of dealers indicated that
t
n
e this issue is a significant and widespread component of discussions. Nonetheless, two-thirds of
m
p respondents reported efforts by asset managers, including those advising mutual funds and hedge
o
e l funds, to incorporate provisions in the relevant agreements providing for the third-party custody

In recent months, investor concerns have reportedly risen regarding the fiscal pressures
facing states, localities, and other issuers of tax-exempt debt (for example, school systems, sewer
and water districts, and hospitals). A final set of special questions explored the degree to which
these concerns have led to changes in credit terms applied to such counterparties and the reasons
for these changes. The questions also addressed the sources of exposure that have warranted the
most attention and the changes in the frequency of mark and collateral disputes with
counterparties of these types. Three-fourths of dealers with counterparty exposure to states,
localities, and other issuers of tax-exempt debt reported that they had tightened somewhat price

and nonprice terms offered to these counterparties over the past three months. The institutions
that reported a tightening of terms pointed to a deterioration in the current or expected financial
strength of counterparties, a worsening in general market liquidity and functioning, a reduced
willingness to take on additional risk, and higher internal capital charges for such transactions as
the main reasons for the changes.10 With regard to the sources of exposure to these entities that
have warranted the most attention from their risk-management functions over the past three
months, dealers pointed to OTC derivative contracts entered into in the context of debt issuance
(for example, to swap fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt), underwriting commitments (for
example, to manage the sale of new debt instruments to investors), and credit enhancement (for
example, of debt instruments or loans). When asked about changes in the volume of mark and
collateral disputes with states, localities, and other issuers of tax-exempt debt over the past three
months, dealers with exposures to such entities reported no change relative to the prior period.

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we consider several alternatives to
the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. We begin with a trio of
simulations involving risks to the inflation projection. In the first scenario, commodity
prices rise considerably more than assumed in the staff projection while other aspects of
the baseline forecast (including stable inflation expectations) remain largely unchanged.
The second scenario examines a more adverse situation, in which supply bottlenecks,
lower potential output, and an unmooring of inflation expectations accompany higher
commodity prices. In contrast, the third scenario considers the risk that core inflation
may continue to decline, along the lines predicted by some of the staff’s reduced-form
models. We then turn to a pair of scenarios examining the risks to aggregate spending—
either that confidence and credit availability may not recover as quickly as we anticipate,
or that economic activity may rebound more robustly. The final scenario considers the
implications for the outlook if geopolitical instability were to intensify, driving up oil
prices and disrupting financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs) and in
financially vulnerable economies in Europe.
In the alternative scenarios, monetary policy responds to movements in real
activity and inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule for the federal funds rate,
while nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the baseline path. We generate the first
five scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated policy rule. The last scenario is
generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different policy rule for
the federal funds rate.1
Greater Commodity Price Increases

have assumed that these prices will be roughly flat going forward, in line with futures

1 For FRB/US, the federal funds rate follows the outcome-based rule described in the appendix on U

difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the k
s
absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices. R i

than expected, and in this scenario oil prices unexpectedly continue climbing and are
about $50 per barrel above baseline by the end of 2012 and only thereafter level out. In
addition, other commodity prices continue rising and are 20 percent above baseline by the
end of this year and 40 percent higher by late 2012.2 Mostly because of the rapid rise in
oil prices, total PCE prices rise 2¾ percent this year and 2¼ percent next year, about
1 percentage point each year, on average, above baseline. Nonetheless, the effects of
these substantial increases in commodity prices on core consumer prices and nominal
wages are relatively modest because we assume that inflation expectations remain well-
anchored and because (following the usual predictions of our models) pass-through
effects are limited (see text table “Measures of PCE Inflation in Selected Alternative
Scenarios”). Core PCE inflation is only about ¼ percentage point higher than in the
baseline, on average, over the next two years. Real activity is somewhat weaker over the
period of 2011 through 2013 than in the staff forecast, in part because higher prices for
commodities that we import, on net, reduce real household incomes. Monetary policy is
little changed from baseline over this period as the additional slack is mostly offset by
higher inflation. This outcome is reminiscent of the 2007-08 period when some
noticeable, but transitory, increases in total inflation coincided with only a modest step-

up in core inflation. t

Persistent Rise in Inflation
Something more than rising commodity prices alone would likely be required to
ignite a more serious and persistent rise in inflation. In this scenario, we consider the
possibility that the higher commodity prices occur in an environment in which the
NAIRU is 1 percentage point above the staff estimate, accelerating real activity creates
temporary bottlenecks that intensify price pressures, and long-run inflation expectations
are more sensitive to persistent movements in headline inflation. Under these conditions,
the restraint on nominal wage gains is less pronounced and firms face greater pressure to
pass on cost increases relative to the baseline. All told, total inflation averages nearly
3½ percent over the next five years, and core inflation climbs to 3¾ percent by 2013. In
response, the federal funds rate rises more rapidly than in the staff projection and reaches
5½ percent by 2015. The higher NAIRU and the more restrictive monetary policy imply
an appreciably slower fall in the unemployment rate—to only 7½ percent at the end of
2015.
Further Disinflation
Of course, the inflation outlook remains subject to downside risks as well. In the
baseline, inflation remains relatively stable over the next several years and then edges up
as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations.
But the stability of various measures of expected inflation to date may be misleading us
about the potential for further disinflation in a persistently weak economy. In this
scenario, core inflation falls a bit below ½ percent by late 2013 and remains at that level
thereafter—a decline that is in line with the predictions of some of our forecasting
equations that do not condition on survey measures of expected inflation. In addition,
investors become more concerned about the possibility of an outcome in which the
economy is mired in a weak deflationary state with monetary policy persistently
constrained by the zero lower bound. As a result, bond premiums rise and put upward
pressure on real long-term interest rates, thereby modestly damping spending and
boosting unemployment relative to baseline over the next few years. In response to lower
y inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower
t
n
a i bound until the middle of 2013. In the longer run, monetary policy is sufficiently
t
r
e stimulative to bring the unemployment rate eventually below baseline and to check the
c
n
U deflationary pressure.

Weaker Recovery
Our baseline forecast of continued recovery depends importantly on steady
improvements in credit availability, consumer and business confidence, and the
willingness of firms to hire. In this scenario, however, these further improvements are
slower to materialize. These developments cause risk aversion to increase, boosting
precautionary saving by households and making firms more reluctant to boost capital
spending and increase payrolls. As a result, the personal saving rate climbs to 7½ percent
by the end of 2012, residential investment is flat, and spending on equipment and
software rises less rapidly than in the baseline. In addition, risk premiums increase,
putting downward pressure on equity and house prices. By the end of 2012, house prices
are 7 percent below baseline while stock prices are about 7 percent below baseline.
Under these conditions, real GDP expands at only a 2½ percent annual pace over the next
two years and labor market conditions stagnate, so that the unemployment rate is still
above 8¾ percent through the end of 2012. Inflation falls in response to more-persistent
slack and remains below baseline through 2015. Liftoff of the federal funds rate from its
effective lower bound is delayed until early 2014.
Stronger Expansion
Overall, recent indicators appear to be consistent with a moderate strengthening in
real activity this year and next. In this scenario, we consider the risk that a more robust
expansion is under way, spurred by a mutually reinforcing dynamic of improved
optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and increasing credit availability. The
stronger activity and improved optimism buoy financial markets and push equity prices
about 11 percent above baseline by the end of this year. This virtuous circle causes real
GDP to expand 4½ percent this year and 5½ percent in 2012, bringing the unemployment
rate down to 6¾ percent by late 2012. With less slack, inflation is higher; however, the
upward pressure on prices is partially checked by more capital deepening, and thus by
larger productivity gains, which hold down unit labor costs. Under these conditions, the
federal funds rate lifts off this year, rising to almost 2 percent by the end of 2012, and
remains above baseline thereafter.

hold risky assets, potentially leading them to withdraw capital from both the EMEs and
the financially vulnerable economies in Europe’s periphery. To capture this possibility,
this scenario assumes that oil prices rise 30 percent above baseline by the end of this year
before gradually receding, corporate bond spreads rise about 100 basis points above
baseline in the EMEs and peripheral Europe, and the broad real dollar appreciates
5 percent because of flight-to-safety effects. In response, real activity is weaker than
baseline as higher oil prices restrain consumer spending and business investment, and as
dollar appreciation and weaker foreign activity dampen real net exports. All told, growth
in U.S. real GDP is only 2¾ percent in 2011, and the unemployment rate remains above
8½ percent through most of 2012, about 1 percentage point higher than in our baseline.
Core inflation falls to about ¾ percent in 2012, as the positive impact of higher oil prices
on core inflation is more than offset by sharply lower U.S. real activity and a stronger
dollar.
