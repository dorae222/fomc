Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information we have received since the July Tealbook suggests that economic D
n
activity is increasing at nearly its trend pace, similar to our view a month ago. To be o
c
E
sure, there were some upside surprises among the incoming data—most notably, retail
c
i
t
sales and payroll employment. However, several indicators of the near-term pace of s
e
m
economic activity, including capital goods orders, private construction spending, and o
D
surveys of consumer and business sentiment, have been disappointing. As a result, we
have upgraded only slightly our assessment of the pace of activity in the nonfarm
economy over the second half of this year. Taking on board the effects of the drought,
which now look likely to have a larger effect on farm output than we previously
estimated, our forecast for the growth of real GDP over the second half of the year is
about unchanged at an average annual rate of 1½ percent.
As a platform for Committee discussion, our medium-term projection is
conditioned on the assumption of no changes in monetary policy. In particular, we have
assumed that the maturity extension program will continue through the end of this year
and that no additional balance sheet actions will be taken. In contrast, market participants
believe that the Committee is likely to announce—perhaps as soon as at the end of the
September meeting—a significant expansion of the System portfolio and an extension of
the date used in the Committee’s forward guidance. Because these market expectations
are not fulfilled in our baseline projection, asset prices gradually reflect over the next
couple of quarters a recognition that monetary policy will be more restrictive over the
medium term than market participants had previously believed.
Under these assumptions, our economic projection for the medium term is broadly
similar to that in the July Tealbook; it features a modest pickup in the pace of economic
activity and a reduction in the unemployment rate over the next three years.1 We have
upgraded the outlook a touch, reflecting, in part, a slightly better outlook for Europe and
our assessment that not all of the recent improvement in equity prices is related to
heightened expectations of further accommodation in monetary policy. Accordingly, we
project that real GDP will rise nearly 2½ percent in 2013 and will then accelerate to a
1 In line with the extension of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) being undertaken in
conjunction with the current FOMC meeting, we discuss our expectations for SEP-level variables through
2015. For more detailed aspects of the projection, the discussion is confined to the period ending in 2014.

u t 3¼ percent pace in 2014, reflecting a lessening of the restraint from fiscal policy and
O
further improvements in financial conditions, credit availability, and household and
&
e l business confidence. We project that the unemployment rate will edge down to 8 percent
v
e
D by the end of 2013. Thereafter, with the pace of activity picking up, the downward tilt in
n
o unemployment becomes more pronounced; by the end of 2015, we have it moving below
c
E
7 percent—still about 1 percentage point above our estimate of its natural rate. In
c
i
t
s addition to importantly influencing the contours of the baseline forecast, both the
e
m
o European financial crisis and the domestic federal fiscal situation continue to present
D
significant downside risks to the outlook.
Readings on core inflation have come in about as we expected in the previous
projection, and the inflation forecast is essentially unchanged: With long-term inflation
expectations well anchored, significant margins of slack in labor and product markets
projected to persist, and relatively small movements projected for commodity prices and
import prices, we expect core PCE inflation to hold steady at about 1½ percent through
2014. In 2015, with the margin of slack diminishing somewhat further, core inflation is
expected to edge up to 1¾ percent. Our projection for total consumer price inflation this
year, at 1¾ percent, is about ¼ percentage point higher than in the July Tealbook,
reflecting the recent rise in oil prices. Thereafter, total PCE inflation is anticipated to run
slightly below core, as energy prices edge down and the higher food price inflation that is
expected to begin later this year, which is related to the drought in the Midwest, proves to
be transitory.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
Consistent with the results from the estimated outcome-based policy rule, we
assume that liftoff of the target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will
occur in the third quarter of 2014.2 Liftoff occurs one quarter earlier than in the July
Tealbook, reflecting the slightly stronger economic outlook in this projection; this earlier
date returns the liftoff assumption to where it was in the June projection.
The path of the federal funds rate in the baseline projection can be sensitive to the
choice of policy rule. As discussed in Book B, the Taylor (1999) rule projects the same

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v
The FOMC last published its Survey of Economic Projections (SEP) following the June FOMC e
D
meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the staff economic projection since the June
n
Tealbook and extends the projection to 2015. o
c
E
c
The staff projection for real activity is little changed since June. Both the downward revision to i
t
s
the projection for real GDP growth in the second half of 2012 and the upward revision to e
m
growth in 2013 largely reflect the effect of the drought on farm production this year and its o
D
expected return to normal next year. Accordingly, the projection for the unemployment rate
through 2014 is about unchanged from the June Tealbook. In 2015, the staff projects a further
strengthening of GDP growth and a somewhat more pronounced decline in the unemployment
rate, reflecting a further waning of the headwinds that have been restraining activity.
Nonetheless, significant slack remains even at the end of 2015.
The staff projection for core PCE inflation is also about unchanged since June. The projection
for overall PCE inflation has been revised up in the second half of this year, primarily reflecting
the upward movement in crude oil prices since the time of the June Tealbook. But these
effects are projected to be short‐lived, and overall PCE inflation after this year remains a touch
below core inflation, about the same as the staff projected in June. In 2015, with a smaller
degree of slack, inflation is projected to edge up closer to the FOMC’s long‐run objective of
2 percent.
With the economic outlook about unchanged, the outcome‐based policy rule calls for the
federal funds rate to move above its effective lower bound in the third quarter of 2014, the
same as in the June Tealbook. By the end of 2015, the federal funds rate is now projected to
reach about 2¼ percent.

nominal GDP would postpone liftoff until the fourth quarter of 2014, while the standard

optimal-control exercise indicates that increases in the federal funds rate would begin in e l

As noted earlier, we have conditioned the September Tealbook projection on the
balance sheet policies to which the FOMC agreed at its most recent meeting. In
particular, we assume that the maturity extension program will continue through the end
of this year and that no additional balance sheet actions will be taken. Because industry
reports and surveys suggest that financial market participants place substantial odds on
the Committee adopting a new program of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), our
projection incorporates some surprise among market participants as they gradually come
to realize, in a process completed by early 2013, that a further LSAP program is not
forthcoming and that the current forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate will
remain in place.5
Other Interest Rates
The 10-year Treasury yield has risen about 15 basis points, on net, since the time
of the July Tealbook. This increase reflects economic data that were, on the whole, better
than market participants had expected as well as less pessimism about the European
crisis. The effects of these developments on Treasury yields evidently more than offset
increased market expectations for additional monetary easing in the near term.
We assume that the downward pressure that is currently being placed on the
10-year Treasury yield by expectations of further monetary accommodation will dissipate
by early next year. More broadly, we project that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds
3 The optimal-control policy noted here is conducted with the FRB/US model under the strong
assumption that future policymakers will remain committed to the plan currently deemed optimal as long as
economic conditions evolve as expected. If we assume instead that future policy may reoptimize at their
discretion, then the optimal-control liftoff date would shift back to the first quarter of 2015.
4 All of these estimates allow for dynamic feedback from the stance of monetary policy to the real
economy and inflation using the FRB/US model; such feedback can have important implications for the
estimated timing of tightening under the different rules.
5 The July Tealbook also incorporated this type of learning about unconventional policy on the
part of market participants.

l
u t will rise about 2 percentage points to around 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.
O
This projected increase primarily reflects the movement of the 10-year valuation window
&
e l through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual waning of the
v
e
D effects of nonconventional monetary policy. In addition, we assume that downward
n
o pressure on Treasury rates will lessen next year as concerns abate about both the crisis in
c
E
Europe and the fiscal situation at home and as the domestic economic recovery gains
c
i
t
s traction.
e
m
o
D
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the
intermeeting period despite the increase in yields on comparable-maturity Treasury
bonds, leaving the implied risk spread about 15 basis points narrower. We expect this
spread to hold fairly steady through the first half of next year and then to narrow more
than ½ percentage point in 2013 and 2014 as concerns about Europe and the U.S. fiscal
situation diminish. Thus, we expect that the yield on investment-grade corporate bonds
will increase 1¼ percentage points during the projection period. Conventional mortgage
rates have not changed much since late July, so their spreads to Treasury yields have
narrowed as well. In the July Tealbook, we had anticipated a narrowing largely along
these lines, so we have not revised the medium-term projection for this spread. All told,
we expect mortgage rates to rise about 1¾ percentage points during the projection period.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have increased about 5 percent, on net, since the
July Tealbook, as market participants appeared to take solace from developments in
Europe and incoming economic data, and as they appeared to build in heightened
expectations of additional monetary easing. Equity prices are projected to show only a
small increase over the next few quarters as concerns about the European crisis and the
U.S. fiscal situation continue to weigh on investor sentiment and as the market reacts to
the absence of a new LSAP. However, with these concerns anticipated to diminish, we
continue to project increases in equity prices of about 9 percent per year in 2013 and
2014. On average, the trajectory of equity prices is about 2½ percent higher in those two
years than in the July projection.
Recent readings for the CoreLogic house price index were stronger than we had
expected and indicate that house price gains were robust through July. We marked up the
projected path for house prices over the projection period by about 1½ percent.
However, we continue to project that growth in house prices will slow in the second half

of this year, in part because we expect to see an increase in the supply of distressed u t
O
properties for sale as some of the largest mortgage servicers step up the pace of
&
foreclosure proceedings upon implementing the terms of their recent settlement with the e l

State Attorneys General. In total, house prices are expected to increase about 6 percent D

this year but only 2 percent, on average, in 2013 and 2014. o

i
Fiscal Policy t
s
e
m
Our fiscal policy assumptions are little changed in this forecast and continue to
o
D
imply that federal fiscal policy will exert a substantial drag on economic growth in the
medium term, especially next year. In particular, we still assume that the temporary
payroll tax cut and the EUC program will expire at the beginning of next year, as
scheduled under current law. We also continue to assume that federal discretionary
spending will be restrained by the caps in the Budget Control Act and by reductions in
defense spending, as overseas military operations are scaled back. However, the
additional cuts scheduled to take effect in January 2013 under the act’s automatic
sequestration are assumed to be replaced by more-gradual budget measures that achieve
the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal year 2021. We have also
maintained our assumption that, other than the temporary payroll tax cut, most federal tax
provisions set to expire at the end of this year under current law will, in fact, be
eventually extended.6 These provisions include the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and
2003, relief for most taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, and a number of other
non-stimulus-related tax reductions.
The legislative process for extending these tax cuts, along with replacing the
automatic spending sequestration with deficit reduction measures that are more gradual,
is likely to be contentious and protracted, plausibly involving a number of short-term
extensions of these policies at the end of this year and in 2013. This legislative
wrangling is assumed to increase uncertainty about that eventual outcome—and to weigh
on household and business spending—beginning later this year and even more so in early
2013.
We expect that fiscal policy at all levels of government will directly restrain the
rate of real GDP growth by about ½ percentage point this year (excluding multiplier
effects), 1 percentage point in 2013, and almost ½ percentage point in 2014. Reflecting
6 In addition, we assume that the federal debt ceiling will be lifted in time to avert a disruption in
the timely payment of all federal obligations, including a default on the federal debt.

u t both the assumed federal fiscal policy tightening in this projection and an anticipated

acceleration in tax revenues as the economic recovery strengthens, the federal budget

c
E Foreign Activity and the Dollar
c
i
s t Foreign real GDP growth slowed to an estimated 2¼ percent pace in the second
e
m
quarter (somewhat less than our estimated trend of about 3 percent), a result of a
o
D
deceleration in emerging market economies as well as a contraction in Europe. In the
current quarter and next, we see foreign economic growth remaining subdued at about its
second-quarter pace, owing to ongoing financial stresses and a relatively weak U.S.
economy. As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook
section, we continue to assume that financial tensions in Europe will intensify in the near
term as policymakers struggle to settle on and implement their plans to stabilize euro-area
sovereigns and banks before beginning to improve next year, as policymakers finally
make more progress. Although this narrative is similar to the July Tealbook, statements
by the ECB over the intermeeting period have suggested a greater commitment to
containing financial stresses, and we now expect these tensions to peak at a lower level
and correspondingly project a less severe euro-area recession. Next year, as the euro-area
recession comes to an end, as U.S. economic activity strengthens, and as monetary
policies remain accommodative, foreign growth is expected to pick up, reaching
3½ percent by the end of 2014. This outlook remains uncertain as European
policymakers still must overcome major hurdles to address their fiscal and banking-sector
vulnerabilities. (For further details, see the box “Effects of the European Situation on the
U.S. Outlook.”)
Since the time of the July Tealbook, the nominal exchange value of the dollar has
moved down somewhat, in part as the prospect of increased ECB action led to an
improvement in market sentiment and to an appreciation of the euro. Nonetheless, from
this lower starting point, we expect the dollar to appreciate in the near term, as financial
stresses in the euro area move back up somewhat and investors gradually reduce their
expectations of additional asset purchases by the Federal Reserve. Thereafter, we assume
that the dollar depreciates in real terms at about a 3 percent annual rate through the end of
2014, in part reflecting the gradual abatement of financial stresses that pushed up the
dollar earlier. All told, the level of the real dollar is a little below that projected in the

Oil and Other Commodity Prices e
D
n
The spot price of Brent crude oil closed at about $114 per barrel on September 4, o

up $10 since the time of the July Tealbook. Much of the increase likely reflects a E
c
i
continued rise in geopolitical tensions associated with Iran and, to a smaller extent, s t
e
m
improved sentiment regarding the situation in Europe. Both the Brent futures curve and
o
D
our forecast for the price of imported oil continue to be steeply downward sloping. The
price of imported oil is projected to remain at about $100 per barrel for most of 2013 and
then to slowly decline over the reminder of the forecast period, reaching $93 per barrel at
the end of 2014. Relative to the July Tealbook, this projection is about $9 higher over the
forecast period, reflecting both higher futures prices as well as a lessening of our negative
adjustment to the futures curve to account for differences between the staff outlook for
global growth and that of outside forecasters.7
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices has risen about 2¼ percent since the
July Tealbook. The increase was concentrated in prices for metals and likely reflected
some improvement in economic sentiment and the recent depreciation of the dollar.
Prices for agricultural commodities are little changed since the time of the previous
Tealbook, but they remain elevated following steep increases in June and early July as
the effect of this summer’s drought on crop yields became apparent. Overall, nonfuel
commodity prices are projected to remain flat through the remainder of this year and then
to decrease at a 1¼ percent pace thereafter, a forecast in line with quotes from futures
markets.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
Economic activity is estimated to have increased at a somewhat faster—though
still only modest—pace during the first half of this year than we had anticipated in the
July Tealbook, but our projection for growth in the second half of the year is little
changed on net. The third quarter appears to have begun promisingly, as the readings for
July on retail sales, payroll employment, and capital goods shipments each were better
7 Our negative adjustment, which pushes down the forecast path of oil prices relative to the futures
curve, reflects a staff outlook for global growth that is weaker than that of outside forecasters. However,
relative to the July Tealbook, the slight upward revision to the staff forecast and downward revision to
outside forecasts have narrowed this difference, and we have lessened our negative adjustment accordingly.

Effects of the European Situation on the U.S. Outlook
&
l
e
v
e Concerns about the fiscal and financial crisis in Europe increased sharply in the summer of
D
2011 as financial stresses spread to Italy and Spain. On balance since a year ago, the
n
o foreign exchange value of the dollar has increased and the European and global
c
E economic outlook has deteriorated, with adverse effects for U.S. foreign trade.
c
i Heightened concerns about the European situation have also affected U.S. asset prices.
t
s
e To gauge the consequences of these developments for the overall U.S. economic
m
o outlook, we use staff models to simulate the implications for U.S. real GDP, the
D
unemployment rate, and inflation.
Prior to the intensification of the crisis, the staff projected in the June 2011 Tealbook that
real GDP growth in the euro area would be moderate (the red line of the lower‐left
figure). However, real GDP in the euro area has actually declined (the black line), and it is
currently projected to fall further this year and part of next year. The staff’s outlook for
foreign economic growth outside the euro area (not shown) is also considerably weaker
than a year ago, in part because of spillovers from the crisis. In addition, safe‐haven
demands stemming from the crisis have contributed to a steep appreciation of the broad
nominal exchange value of the dollar (shown in the lower‐right figure).
The intensification of the crisis in Europe since June 2011 has also left an imprint on U.S.
asset prices. The staff estimates that the European crisis has had a cumulative negative
effect on domestic equity prices of about 10 percent. The staff also believes that this
downward pressure on equity prices resulted from revisions by market participants to
their outlooks for corporate profits over the medium term in addition to an increase in
the rate of return required by investors to hold equities because the downside risks to
the global economic outlook increased. In addition, these concerns are calculated to
have lowered the term‐premium component of yields on long‐term nominal Treasury
securities about 80 basis points as the European crisis exacerbated flight‐to‐safety
demands. The staff estimates that yields of private domestic securities have also been
held down by the European situation, though not by as much as Treasury yields. In
particular, yields on BBB‐rated corporate bonds are judged to have decreased only about
40 basis points, while the comparable figure for 30‐ year residential mortgage rates is
about 60 basis points.

The table below shows the aggregate effects on U.S. economic activity and inflation of &
l
the changes in both foreign conditions and U.S. financial conditions that the staff judges e
v
to have occurred because of the intensification of the European crisis since June 2011.1 D e
The simulation indicates that the rate of real U.S. GDP growth (line 1) was held down n
o
about ¼ percentage point last year, and will be about ¾ percentage point lower both this c
E
year and next.2 The appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar, which boosts c
i
t
imports and lowers exports, is estimated to have the largest negative effect (line 2) on s
e
U.S. economic activity, reducing the rate of real GDP growth about ½ percentage point in m
o
both 2012 and 2013. The staff estimates that lower economic activity in the euro area D
(line 3), which also lowers U.S. exports, has reduced and will continue to reduce the rate
of U.S. real GDP growth about 0.1 percentage point, on average, from 2011 through 2013.
Negative spillovers to economic activity in other trading partners contribute a similar
amount (line 4).3 The net effects of the changes in domestic financial conditions (line 5)
on U.S. GDP are small because the drag from lower equity prices is essentially offset by
the boost from lower private long‐term interest rates.
All told, the unemployment rate (line 6) is expected to be almost ½ percentage point
higher by the end of this year and is anticipated to be about ¾ percentage point higher by
the end of next year as a result of the European crisis. Inflation (line 7) is slightly lower,
reflecting both the higher exchange value of the dollar and lower resource utilization.

The table reflects calculations from several staff models. In particular, the decomposition of the
trade effects uses the trade model maintained by the International Finance Division, while the estimate
of the overall macroeconomic effects is based on simulations of the FRB/US model. In the FRB/US
simulations, the federal funds rate is set using the same estimated policy rule that is used in the staff
baseline projection, and nonconventional policy retains its baseline setting.
2
These adverse effects are slightly smaller than would have been estimated at the time of the July
Tealbook as the situation in Europe appears to have improved a bit recently.

The effect of negative spillovers from other trading partners is estimated by assuming that a
1 percentage point reduction in the rate of change in euro‐area real GDP translates to a ¼ percentage
point reduction in the rate of real GDP growth in the rest of the world. Because the rest of the world
makes up a much larger share of U.S. exports than the euro area, this spillover effect ends up roughly
the same as the euro‐area effect.

than expected. However, the recent forward-looking indicators have been disappointing, u t
O
on balance, and we estimate that the drought will pull down real GDP growth in the
&
second half of this year. Consequently, we estimate that real GDP will advance at an e l
v
e
annual rate of just 1½ percent over this period, the same in as the July Tealbook. At the D
n
same time, we expect the unemployment rate to hold near its current level. o

The Labor Market t
s
e
m
Private payroll employment rose 172,000 in July, about 70,000 more than we had
o
D
expected. However, the unemployment rate edged up to 8.3 percent in July and has been
moving essentially sideways since early this year. Likewise, the labor force participation
rate was 63.7 percent in July, about the same as in the first and second quarters. (For a
broader discussion, see the box “Labor Force Participation Rate.”) Other indicators of
labor market activity are also little changed since the most recent Tealbook: Initial
claims for unemployment insurance remain close to their levels as of the July Tealbook,
surveys of small businesses’ hiring plans have changed little in recent months, and
households’ expectations of future labor market conditions remain subdued.
With output projected to rise only modestly in the second half of the year, we
expect the labor market to continue to improve only slowly in the near term. We have
taken some signal from the July employment report, and we now expect private
employers to add 120,000 jobs per month, on average, in August and September and
about 150,000 per month in the fourth quarter; both of these figures are about 25,000 per
month higher than in the July Tealbook forecast.8 However, as before, we anticipate that
the unemployment rate will remain at 8.3 percent for the rest of the year, as the modest
job gains we project (even though slightly better than in July) are insufficient to reduce
the jobless rate.
The Industrial Sector
After monthly increases averaging only ¼ percent in the second quarter,
manufacturing industrial production (IP) rose ½ percent in July. Motor vehicle
assemblies stepped up to an annual rate of 10.7 million units in July, partly reflecting a
shortening of the usual summer shutdowns at some auto companies; however,
automakers’ assembly schedules suggest much of this gain is likely to be unwound in
August and September, leaving the average pace of production this quarter similar to that
8 After accounting for our estimates of the distortion of the seasonal-adjustment factors, the underlying pace
of employment gains in both the third and fourth quarters is projected to be about 130,000 per month.

The Labor Force Participation Rate
&
l
e
v The labor force participation rate (the black line in the lower‐left figure) fell 1¾ percentage points from
e
D the business cycle peak in the last quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of this year.1 The staff
n
o estimates that a little over 1 percentage point of this decline can be attributed to the long‐term trend
c
E in participation (the red line). This long‐term downtrend has two major components. First, the share
i c of the population at older ages, which has lower‐than‐average participation rates, has been rising.2
t
s
e Second, the participation rates of young persons (the red line, on the left scale, in the lower‐right
m
o figure), especially teenagers, have been falling for more than a decade. This downtrend among young
D
persons is likely a response to increased incentives for education and to shrinking job opportunities for
their age group as the ongoing polarization of the labor market has led to jobs traditionally held by
young workers being increasingly taken by older workers.3
The participation rate also seems to have been influenced by the financial crisis, the recession, and
their aftermath. For example, early in the recession, the drop in household wealth and the many job
losses may have led some workers to delay retirement and others to enter the labor force. In addition,
the introduction of extended and emergency unemployment compensation likely led some job losers
to remain in the labor force longer than they would have otherwise.4 By 2009, however, these
influences were probably far overshadowed by the downward pressure on participation rates
associated with the decision of some prospective workers not to search for work in the face of poor
job opportunities. The staff believes that this cyclical response by prospective workers explains a
large portion of the overall decline in the participation rate since 2007.
1
This figure adjusts for revisions to population weighting in the published data. On a published basis, the rate has
fallen 2¼ percentage points. The discussion in this box abstracts from these revisions.
2
Although the participation rates at older ages (the blue line, on the left scale, in the lower‐right figure) have risen
over the past few years, they remain well below the average at lower ages, so the aging of the population has resulted
in a lower overall participation rate.
3
More education tends to lead to greater participation later in life. However, the net effect of the increased
incentives for education is likely to be to depress the aggregate participation rate. Polarization refers to the shifting of
the demand for labor away from middle‐skilled jobs and toward both higher‐ and lower‐skilled jobs.
4
The staff estimates that these programs boosted the level of participation last quarter by 0.1 percentage point.

u
In previous recessions, the labor force participation rate did not fall as sharply as in the recent O
recession. However, the current cyclical decline in participation does not appear to be fundamentally &
l
out of line with the especially steep deterioration and slow recovery in job opportunities. Hence, we e
v
e
think that the current low participation rate is not significantly distorting the signal for labor utilization D
from the unemployment rate. The household survey provides some evidence in this regard. Its n
o
measure of persons not in the labor force but marginally attached is an indicator of those who are c
E
most likely to be out of the labor force because of poor job prospects.5 The figure below shows a c
i
t
measure of labor underutilization that includes marginally attached persons (U‐5, the blue line) as well s
e
as one that includes all persons out of the labor force who say they want a job (the potential worker m
o
rate, the red line). Historically, these rates have moved fairly well in tandem with the official D
unemployment rate (the black line), and they have continued to be well aligned more recently.
Parsing the decline in participation into trend and cyclical components is difficult, especially in real
time. Indeed, over the past few years the staff has revised down its estimate of the trend in
participation, mostly because research has suggested that more of the ongoing weakness in
participation reflects long‐term forces (such as polarization) than we had assumed, and also because
we have judged that some of the response to overall poor job prospects would persist even if labor
demand were to recover soon. To be sure, uncertainty in this regard remains considerable. Moreover,
labor market developments need not fit neatly into the separate categories of trend and cycle. For
example, some workers may have accelerated their planned retirements in reaction to poor job
prospects. As time goes by, these early retirees reach ages at which they would have retired in any
case. In this example, the trend in participation declined sooner in response to the business cycle but
with no net effect on the level of the trend some years hence.
Looking ahead, the staff expects the cyclical downward pressure on labor force participation to
diminish as the demand for labor improves, even as the long‐term downtrend continues. In our
projection these two forces are roughly offsetting in the medium term, and the participation rate
remains fairly flat, converging slowly to its long‐term trend.
5
Marginally attached persons are those who are not currently looking for work but want a job, are available to
work, and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months.

in the second quarter. Outside motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output moved up u t
O
just 0.2 percent in July after having edged down in the second quarter.

e

Moreover, the available indicators of near-term factory activity remain e
D
downbeat.9 With data through August, the new orders diffusion index from the national n
o
c
ISM survey and the orders indexes from the regional manufacturing surveys, on balance, E
c
i
remained weak for a third consecutive month. Taking into account these surveys and the t
s
e
m
flat trajectory for motor vehicle assemblies in the coming months, we expect factory
o
D
output to expand at a tepid 2½ percent annual rate in the second half of the year.
Household Spending
Real PCE rose 0.4 percent in July, reflecting a surprisingly large jump in retail
sales. However, those data are quite erratic, and with gasoline prices having moved up,
job gains remaining modest, and consumer sentiment still relatively downbeat, we have
not extrapolated forward the July strength in spending; indeed, we anticipate smaller
gains in coming months. In all, real PCE is projected to rise at an annual rate of
2¼ percent over the second half of the year, similar to our forecast in the July Tealbook.
The incoming data continue to point to a gradual recovery in housing activity,
albeit from a very depressed level. Single-family housing starts have risen, on net, since
last fall, and permits for new construction have steadily edged up, though both measures
remain less than one-third of their levels of several years ago. In addition, some signs
indicate that housing demand has firmed over the past year: Home sales have stepped up,
while the homeowner vacancy rate has declined; measures of house prices have risen
noticeably since the beginning of this year; and indicators of home builders’ and realtors’
sentiment have improved. Even so, demand remains constrained by difficult mortgage
credit conditions and uncertainty about future income and employment prospects.
Furthermore, the stock of vacant homes held off the market, which is not included in the
homeowner vacancy rate, remains elevated. This “shadow inventory,” which includes
many bank-owned properties, will likely redirect demand from new construction to
existing homes once these properties are put on the market. All told, we project single-
family starts to increase only modestly in the near term.
9 We currently estimate that Hurricane Isaac reduced the rate of change in total IP in August by about
0.3 percentage point, principally from the preventative idling of nearly all of the oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of
Mexico and, to a lesser extent, from the shutdown of several Gulf Coast petroleum refineries. Production in the
affected industries is expected to return to pre-hurricane levels by the end of September.

At the same time, some of the factors restraining home purchases have fueled u t
O
demand for rental units, leading to falling vacancy rates and rising rents. Consequently,
&
activity in the multifamily sector has picked up more rapidly than in the single-family e l
v
e
sector, and we expect to see a continued upswing in multifamily starts in coming months D
n
as these conditions persist. o

Business Investment t
s
e
m
We estimate that real business spending on equipment and software (E&S) rose at
o
D
a modest annual rate of about 4 percent in the second quarter, somewhat less than
projected in the July Tealbook. We expect spending to decelerate further in the second
half of the year as concerns about the European situation, the U.S. fiscal situation, and the
sluggish pace of the domestic recovery make businesses more reluctant to invest. Indeed,
new orders for nondefense capital goods outside of transportation have fallen sharply
over the past several months and currently stand notably below the level of shipments.
Consistent with this view, a number of other forward-looking indicators of
business investment also point to subdued increases in business outlays. For example,
indexes from various surveys of business conditions have been at low levels for several
months, surveys of capital spending plans have continued to be downbeat, and corporate
bond spreads remain somewhat elevated. As a result, we expect E&S spending to
increase at an annual rate of only around 1 percent over the second half of this year.
After a year of surprising strength, incoming data suggest that spending on
nonresidential construction (excluding drilling and mining) rose at a moderate pace in the
second quarter. However, the spending data for July, the subdued readings from the
architectural billings index, and the sector’s poor fundamentals lead us to project that
outlays will decline somewhat in the second half of this year. Moreover, although there
are hints of some easing in financing conditions for existing commercial real estate, we
anticipate that high vacancy rates, low commercial real estate prices, and difficult
financing conditions for new construction will continue to put downward pressure on
building activity for the foreseeable future.
In the drilling and mining sector, investment edged down in the first half of 2012,
likely reflecting the low natural gas prices that have prevailed since the second half of
last year. Nevertheless, spending remains at a high level following brisk increases in the
previous two years that were driven by rising crude oil prices and by new drilling

u t techniques. We expect outlays for drilling and mining structures to remain near current
O
levels in the near term, in line with the relatively flat trajectories of energy prices.
&
l
e
v
e Firms in the nonfarm business sector appear to have accumulated inventories in
D
n the second quarter at a rate similar to that in the first quarter, as some further restocking
o
c
E of auto dealers’ lots offset a slowing in the pace of accumulation elsewhere. Available
c
i
t estimates from the staff’s flow-of-goods system, reports on dealer inventories of motor
s
e
m
vehicles, and surveys of inventory satisfaction generally indicate that inventory stocks are
o
D
fairly well aligned with sales in most sectors, although some indicators suggest perhaps
less comfort with inventories than was the case earlier in the year. In the current
economic environment we expect producers to be cautious in boosting the pace of
stockbuilding, and so we expect inventory investment to contribute only a little to real
GDP growth over the rest of the year.
By contrast, we estimate that the sharp drop in farm production stemming from
the drought will lead to a significant drawdown in farm inventories this quarter, which by
itself will subtract about ½ percentage point (annual rate) from real GDP growth. We
expect that farm stocks will be liquidated at about the same pace in the fourth quarter,
which will consequently have no arithmetic effect on GDP growth in that quarter.
Government
Real federal purchases fell at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of 2012,
driven by declines in defense spending. As in the July Tealbook, we anticipate broadly
similar reductions in total federal purchases in the second half of the year.
By contrast, the contraction in the state and local sector appears to be gradually
moderating, as fiscal conditions of these governments become somewhat less tight. After
dropping at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, real state and local purchases
fell 1 percent in the second quarter, and we anticipate an even smaller decline in the
second half of the year. In part, the moderation is reflected in a slowing in the pace of
decline in real public construction expenditures in the second quarter, a trend that we
expect to continue over the rest of the year. In addition, the decrease in state and local
payrolls during the first half of the year was considerably smaller than in 2011; we expect
payrolls to decline a little further in the third quarter before stabilizing in the fourth
quarter. In total, federal, state, and local purchases are expected to subtract ¼ percentage
point from the annual rate of real GDP growth in the second half of this year.

Foreign Trade u t
O
After having risen at an annual rate of 6 percent in the second quarter, real exports &
l
of goods and services are expected to decelerate to a 3¼ percent increase over the second e
v
e
half of this year, more in line with the relatively sluggish pace of foreign growth that we D
n
anticipate as well as the prior appreciation of the dollar. This forecast is about the same o
c
E
as in the July Tealbook, as our reaction to the strength of exports in the trade data for c
i
t
June and the effects of the decline in the dollar since July offset weaker projected exports e s
m
of agricultural products as a consequence of this summer’s drought. Meanwhile, real o
D
imports of goods and services are expected to increase 3¼ percent over the second half of
2012, almost 1½ percentage points less than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting the
lower dollar, our response to a weaker-than-expected reading on imports in June, and a
markdown to our forecast for oil import growth. All told, we expect the external sector to
be about neutral for GDP growth in the third quarter and to subtract ¼ percentage point
from growth in the fourth quarter, a contour that is on average about ¼ percentage point
less of a drag than projected in July.
Prices and Wages
Total PCE price inflation stepped down from an annual rate of 2½ percent in the
first quarter to ¾ percent in the second quarter, reflecting both the large drop in energy
prices during the spring and some deceleration in core PCE prices. Over the second half
of this year, total PCE prices are projected to rise at an average annual rate of about
1¾ percent, reflecting the rebound in oil prices since the July Tealbook. Compared with
our previous projection, total PCE inflation is nearly ¾ percentage point higher on
average in the second half of this year.
Spot and futures prices of food commodities soared through mid-July as the
severity of this summer’s drought became apparent, and these prices have remained
elevated in recent weeks. The pass-through of farm commodity price changes into
consumer food prices tends to occur with a lag, and, moreover, a lower-than-expected
reading on consumer food prices in July led us to revise down our current-quarter
estimate for PCE food price inflation by about ¾ percentage point, to an annual rate of
1½ percent. Looking ahead, we project that PCE food price inflation will move up to an
annual rate of 3½ percent in the fourth quarter as the pass-through of farm commodity
price increases into PCE food prices begins in earnest. Notwithstanding these substantial
swings, the projected acceleration in food prices provides only a small boost to total

l
u t consumer price inflation because of the relatively small weight of food in overall
O
consumer expenditures.
&
l
e
v
e The incoming data on core consumer price inflation have been close to our
D
n expectations. Core PCE price inflation slowed from an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the
o
c
E first quarter to 1¾ percent in the second quarter, and core prices were flat in July. We
c
i
t continue to expect core PCE inflation to run at an annual rate of 1½ percent over the
s
e
m
second half of 2012, reflecting, in part, recent declines in the prices of core imports and
o
D
industrial materials.
In the latest data, the quarterly pattern of private hourly compensation was
revised up noticeably for the first half of the year. However, this series is particularly
volatile, and the second quarter was only a little more than 2 percent above its level four
quarters earlier, the same as in the July Tealbook. In addition, the employment cost index
for private industry workers rose about 2 percent in the second quarter, close to what we
had expected. We anticipate that hourly compensation will rise during the second half of
this year at roughly that pace, similar to our forecast in the July Tealbook.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
The broad contour of the medium-term projection is similar to our forecast in the
July Tealbook. In particular, we continue to project that further improvements in
financial conditions, an eventual easing of the financial crisis in Europe, and rising
household and business confidence will support a modest acceleration in real GDP. In
addition, although the tightening of fiscal policy in 2013 is anticipated to impose a
substantial drag on economic growth next year, the fiscal restraint on growth is expected
to ease significantly in 2014, which contributes materially to the acceleration in real GDP
in that year. Still, a number of persistent headwinds are expected to ease only slowly and
so continue to weigh on the pace of the recovery over the projection period, including
tight credit for some households and businesses, the ongoing drag from the widespread
losses in home equity, an overhang of vacant homes that continues to hold back
residential construction, and foreign demand that remains subdued.
We raised our projection for real GDP growth a bit in 2013, in part because the
expected rebound in farm production after the drought-stricken harvest of 2012 boosts
aggregate output. In addition, the recent decline in the dollar in response to
developments in Europe implies less drag on U.S. activity from the external sector. Also,

the small upward revisions we made to stock prices and house prices boosts household u t
O
wealth. These positive factors modestly outweigh the drag from higher oil prices next
&
year. As a result, after increasing about 1½ percent this year, real GDP is projected to e l
v
e
rise 2½ percent next year (about ¼ percentage point more than in the July Tealbook) and D
n
then to expand 3¼ percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in 2015. With real GDP expected to o
c
E
increase at about the same pace as the growth rate of potential output this year and next,
c
i
t
the unemployment rate does not decline to below 8 percent until 2014—when real GDP s
e
m
begins to rise materially faster than potential. By the end of 2015, the unemployment rate o
D
is projected to have declined to 6¾ percent.
As has been the case for some time, part of the fiscal restraint in our projection
shows through as declining federal purchases. After decreasing 4¼ percent in 2011 and
2½ percent this year, real federal purchases are expected to fall about 4¼ percent in both
2013 and 2014, reflecting the effects of the Budget Control Act and the continued
drawdown of overseas military operations. In the state and local sector, fiscal conditions
are likely to remain tight for some time; although state tax revenues have been rising at a
pace consistent with income growth, local taxes, which are dominated by property taxes,
have been stagnant, and federal stimulus–related grants have essentially ended.
Consequently, we expect real state and local purchases to be about flat in 2013 and to rise
at a tepid pace in 2014. In total, federal, state, and local purchases are anticipated to
subtract about ¼ percentage point from real GDP growth in 2013 and in 2014.
The large fiscal drag we expect next year also shows through indirectly to the
growth in consumer spending. The assumed expiration at the end of this year of both the
temporary payroll tax cut and the EUC program will subtract significantly from income
growth in 2013, and thus will likely weigh on consumer spending, particularly early in
the year. By contrast, higher equity wealth, increasing household confidence, and a
modestly improving labor market should provide support for consumer spending. In
total, real PCE is expected to expand 2½ percent in 2013, only about ¼ percentage point
faster than this year. In 2014, consumer spending is projected to accelerate further, as the
drag from fiscal policy wanes and as employment prospects, income growth, and
household net worth continue to improve.
With the economies of our trading partners anticipated to improve, and with the
dollar expected to depreciate over the medium term, real exports are projected to increase
4½ percent in 2013 and 5¾ percent in 2014. Real imports are expected to grow at an

average pace of 4½ percent over the medium term, supported by a pickup in the pace of u t

U.S. economic activity that more than offsets the drag stemming from a depreciating

dollar. Overall, we expect net trade to make small negative contributions to real GDP e l
v
e
growth next year and in 2014; this drag is slightly less than in the previous Tealbook due D
n
to the lower path for the exchange value of the dollar. o

Despite the fact that many large firms have ample cash on hand and ready access t
s
e
m
to capital markets, lackluster demand and uncertainty about sales prospects appear to be
o
D
restraining businesses’ capital spending plans. Moreover, until the recovery is clearly on
a stronger footing, the business sector as a whole will likely remain cautious. We
therefore continue to expect expenditures on E&S to strengthen only gradually over the
medium term, rising 5 percent in 2013 before stepping up to a growth rate of about
7 percent in 2014, as economic conditions and business sentiment continue to improve.
Many of these same factors are holding back business investment in
nonresidential structures (other than drilling and mining). In addition, with persistently
high vacancy rates and continued tight conditions for construction and development
loans, we expect real construction spending to be about flat next year and to manage only
small gains in 2014. In contrast, investment in drilling and mining is expected to rise
over the medium term following its decline this year, as the new horizontal drilling
techniques are further deployed.
Although the incoming data point to an ongoing improvement in housing activity,
the recovery in this sector is still expected to be meager. Historically low mortgage rates
would normally be expected to bolster home purchases and lead to a significant increase
in new construction over the medium term. However, the ongoing difficulties faced by
many households in accessing mortgage credit, coupled with lingering uncertainty about
employment and income prospects, are likely to materially restrain the impetus from low
mortgage rates. In addition, the flow of homes from foreclosure into the resale market is
expected to remain substantial, thus limiting the demand for new construction.
Accordingly, we project single-family housing starts to rise only gradually over the
forecast period to an annual rate nearing 750,000 units by the end of 2014.

Productivity and the Labor Market D
Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of about
¾ percent in the first half of this year, roughly the same pace as in 2011 but somewhat
faster than we had anticipated in the July Tealbook. We estimate that the level of labor
productivity was about ½ percent above its structural trend in the second quarter,
compared with no gap being shown in our previous forecast. We expect that this gap will
essentially close over the projection period as labor productivity rises a bit less than its
trend rate. The slower rise in labor productivity—around ¼ percentage point per year
less than in the July projection—occurs as firms bring their labor inputs into better
alignment with their production needs by increasing hours and employment somewhat
more quickly than in the July Tealbook.
The projected path for payroll employment also reflects the slightly faster
increase in real GDP in this projection. In 2013, increases in private payroll employment
are expected to average about 150,000 per month, a little greater than in the July
Tealbook. As GDP growth moves well above its trend rate in 2014, private employment
gains pick up to a more solid pace of around 225,000 per month. The employment gains
we project for 2013 are still fairly modest, and the decline in the unemployment rate,
from 8¼ percent currently to 8 percent in the final quarter of next year, is mostly
attributable to the expiration of the EUC program at the end of this year. The somewhat
faster pace of hiring in 2014 brings down the unemployment rate to just above
7½ percent at the end of 2014.
10 We estimate that the boost to the “effective” natural rate of unemployment from the emergency
and extended unemployment insurance programs has diminished and is worth only about ¼ percentage
point at present. This effect is expected to dissipate completely next year as these programs are fully
wound down.

Resource Utilization u t
O
Labor market slack remains considerable throughout the medium-term forecast, &
l
with the unemployment rate at the end of 2014 still 1½ percentage points above our e
v
e
estimate of the natural rate. The gap between actual and potential GDP narrows only D
n
slightly next year and does not begin to shrink perceptibly until 2014; real GDP at the end o
c
E
of 2014 is a bit more than 3 percent below our estimate of potential output. c
i
t
s
e
m
From the end of 2007 through 2010, manufacturing capacity plunged about
o
D
6 percent, and it has increased only sluggishly since then. Notwithstanding some
important conceptual differences between capacity utilization and the measures of
resource utilization mentioned earlier, there appears to be less slack in the manufacturing
sector currently than in the broader economy.11 Indeed, capacity utilization in
manufacturing in July, at 77.8 percent, was only 1 percentage point below its long-run
average rate. Consequently, even as the amount of slack in the manufacturing sector and
in the broader economy narrow at comparable rates over the rest of the projection period,
the factory operating rate reaches its long-run average in early 2014 despite the still-
sizable GDP gap.
Prices and Compensation
Overall inflation is expected to remain subdued over the projection period. A key
factor influencing this projection is our assumption that inflation expectations will remain
stable. Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by the
Survey of Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2.2 percent in the third quarter,
whereas 10-year CPI inflation expectations edged down to 2.4 percent. In the Michigan
survey for August, median 5-to-10-year expected inflation increased to 3 percent.
However, we suspect that this increase stems from the recent rise in gasoline prices and is
thus likely to be transitory, similar to the pattern we saw back in the spring; moreover, the
latest reading is within the range in which this measure of inflation expectations has
fluctuated over the past 10 years. The TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation
over the next 5 years rose 20 basis points since the July Tealbook, and the measure for
5-to-10 years ahead rose 5 basis points.
11 Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in labor input,
our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of plants to produce with the
equipment that is in place and ready to operate; it does not take account of the potential workforce, either
inside the industrial sector or outside it.

Another important element contributing to the low rates of inflation in this u t
O
projection is import prices. Prices of imported core goods are expected to decrease at a
&
1 percent annual rate in the second half of this year, a decline that is about ½ percentage e l
v
e
point larger than in the July projection, reflecting the lagged effects of previous declines D
n
in commodity prices and past dollar appreciation. For the remainder of the forecast o
c
E
period, core import price inflation is expected to run at a 1¼ percent pace, unchanged
c
i
t
from the previous Tealbook. s
e
m
o
D
These factors and the still-considerable underutilization in labor and product
markets expected over the medium term lead us to project core inflation of 1.6 percent in
both 2013 and 2014, rates that are the same as the previous projection. Meanwhile, total
PCE inflation is projected to run a little below core over the medium term, as the
anticipated declines in crude oil prices put downward pressure on retail energy prices. In
2015, inflation is expected to edge up, as resource utilization increases.
In our projection, persistent labor market slack, stable inflation expectations, and
low rates of price inflation restrain gains in our forecast for hourly compensation. Both
the nonfarm hourly compensation measure and the employment cost index are projected
to rise at or a bit below 3 percent in 2013 and in 2014.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and
our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.
The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key assumptions:
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent, consistent with
the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 2012 meeting. The
federal funds rate continues to be set according to the estimated outcome-
based rule.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2015 through 2017. However, as the
time when normalization of the portfolio draws nearer, this downward
pressure diminishes, which contributes to the rise in the 10-year Treasury
yield. Beyond 2017, the process of portfolio normalization should be
essentially completed.

terms. Foreign real GDP growth rises slightly to a 3½ percent pace in 2015
and then declines very gradually to a 3 percent annual rate late in the decade.
 The natural rate of unemployment declines from 6 percent in the fourth

market continue to improve, and it remains at that level in the long run.
Potential GDP increases at an average annual rate of about 2¼ percent in 2015
through the end of the decade.
The economy is projected to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level,
unemployment above its assumed natural rate, and inflation below the long-run objective
of the Committee. In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in household
and business confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and supportive financial conditions
enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of more than 3 percent from 2015
through 2017. With real GDP expanding at a pace faster than the growth rate of potential
output, labor market conditions improve further, and the unemployment rate ends 2017 at
5¾ percent. With long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain well anchored and
the margin of slack in labor and product markets diminishing, consumer price inflation
edges up gradually. Late in the decade, the economy converges to an unemployment rate
near its long-run natural rate, an inflation rate at the Committee’s longer-term objective,
and a nominal federal funds rate of 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the second
quarter, and we see foreign growth remaining at this subdued pace in the second half of
this year, restrained by ongoing financial and fiscal stresses in Europe and a relatively
weak U.S. economy. In 2013, as the euro-area recession is projected to end, aggregate
foreign growth is forecast to edge up to 2¾ percent, a touch below its trend pace. It rises
further to 3¼ percent in 2014 as the euro-area economy starts growing and the U.S.
expansion picks up strength. This projection is little changed from that in the previous
k
o
Tealbook. We marked up our forecast of growth in the euro area, where policy o
l
t
u
developments have been more positive and financial conditions improved somewhat over O
the intermeeting period. However, we made downward revisions to near-term growth in &
l
e
many other foreign economies, where recent data have been weaker than we had v
e
D
expected.
n
o
c
E
In the euro area, real GDP fell in the second quarter and more recent data point to l
’
t
n
a further decline in the second half of this year. However, recent policy developments I
have been more promising. Since the close of the July Tealbook, the European Central
Bank (ECB) has indicated a stronger commitment than was anticipated to resolve the
crisis, likely through secondary-market purchases of peripheral sovereign debt, and
officials in Spain and Italy have signaled that they may consider requesting external
assistance. In response, financial market sentiment has generally improved, and although
some of this improvement may well be reversed as European leaders struggle to
implement these measures, we nevertheless anticipate that financial stresses in the next
several quarters will be somewhat less pronounced than we assumed in the July
Tealbook. By next year, we assume financial tensions will start to ease on a more
sustained basis amid further progress on the reform agenda, but full normalization of
market conditions will likely take years to achieve.
Notwithstanding these improvements, the foreign outlook remains very uncertain.
The risk of a much more severe intensification of the crisis remains serious. Conversely,
if European leaders act forcefully, market conditions could improve more rapidly than we

expect, posing some upside risk. Outside of Europe, both a resurgence in oil prices and a
sharp deceleration in Chinese activity pose downside risks to global growth.1
Amid subdued economic growth and declines in crude oil prices, foreign headline
inflation slowed to just under 2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter and
1¾ percent in the third. By next quarter, as the recent run-up in crude oil prices shows
through to retail energy prices, foreign inflation should pick up to a little above
2½ percent. Thereafter, foreign inflation is expected to average just below this pace, little
changed from our previous Tealbook forecast.
k
o Most major foreign central banks left monetary policies unchanged during the
o
l
t intermeeting period. With subdued inflation and weak growth prospects, we expect some

central banks, such as the ECB, the People’s Bank of China, and the Bank of England

n ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
c
E
’ l Real GDP growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) slowed from
t
n
I 1.6 percent in the first quarter to 0.7 percent in the second. We expect growth to remain
near this subdued pace in the second half of the year, as the euro-area recession deepens
and activity decelerates in Japan. Growth in the AFEs should pick up to 1¼ percent in
2013 and nearly 2 percent in 2014, with the euro-area recession abating and global
economic conditions slowly improving. This forecast is little changed from the July
Tealbook, as some upward revision to the euro-area forecast is offset by downward
revisions elsewhere in the advanced economies, where recent data indicate less
momentum.
Headline inflation in the AFEs dipped to 0.6 percent in the second quarter from
2.2 percent in the first, with especially large declines in Canada, where retail energy
prices fell, and Japan, where domestic food prices plunged. Data suggest that AFE
inflation remained subdued at around ¾ percent in the third quarter, but the recent run-up
in oil prices is expected to help push up inflation to nearly 2 percent in the fourth quarter,
½ percentage point higher than we previously expected. Thereafter, our projection is

little changed from that in the July Tealbook, with AFE inflation at 1¼ percent in 2013
and rising to a still-modest 1¾ percent in 2014 as economic conditions improve and
Japan hikes its consumption tax.
Euro Area
Euro-area GDP declined 0.7 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, and
recent data suggest further weakening in the current quarter. PMIs remained firmly in
contractionary territory in July and August, and business and consumer confidence
worsened. In addition, the unemployment rate was at a record 11.3 percent in June and
July. Accordingly, we expect the euro-area recession to deepen, with real GDP
k
o
contracting at a pace of almost 1¼ percent in the second half of this year. In 2013, the o
l
t
recession ends, but output stagnates, as continued financial stresses, fiscal consolidation, u
O
and other headwinds weigh on the recovery. By 2014, these headwinds diminish, and, &
l
e
with monetary policy remaining accommodative, growth for the year picks up to v
e
D
1¼ percent.
n
o
c
E
As bleak as this forecast is, it is about ¼ percentage point stronger than in the July
l
’
t
Tealbook over the next year and a half. This upward revision primarily reflects policy n
I
developments since the July Tealbook, which have reduced financial tensions and suggest
that European policymakers could act somewhat earlier and more proactively to resolve
the crisis than we had previously anticipated. (See the box “Recent Developments in the
Euro Area.”) Most importantly, ECB President Mario Draghi has indicated that the ECB
is prepared to resume secondary-market purchases of peripheral sovereign debt, provided
the governments first agree to policy conditionality sufficient to allow the European
financial rescue facilities to join in the support. In addition, leaders in Spain and Italy
have signaled that they would consider requesting external assistance.
In the coming months, we anticipate that markets will remain volatile and may
well give back some of their recent gains as debates on the scope and implementation of
the ECB’s bond purchase strategy continue, Spain and Italy struggle to meet fiscal
targets, and negotiations heat up between Greece and its official creditors on the
country’s adjustment program. However, we now expect European authorities to provide
assistance with more limited conditionality and, thus, less stigma than was the case in
previous rescue programs. Accordingly, we expect Spain (and perhaps Italy) to more
readily request assistance in response to a heightening of financial pressures, thereby

Recent Developments in the Euro Area
Lately, financial stresses in the euro area have lessened amid expectations of more forceful
action by the European Central Bank (ECB), of progress toward a European banking union,
and of more constructive negotiations between Greece and its official creditors. However,
plans for ECB operations and the banking union have yet to be fleshed out. In addition, the
permanent European financial backstop is still not operational, leaving financial markets
vulnerable to negative developments.
An important factor contributing to the easing of financial tensions since late July has been
the expectation that the ECB will again intervene in sovereign debt markets. ECB President
k Draghi stated in a speech on July 26 that “within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do
o o whatever it takes to preserve the euro.”1 In the week following this speech, Italian and
l
u t Spanish 2‐year sovereign yields declined about 120 basis points and 150 basis points,
O
respectively (see figures on the following page).
&
l
e On August 2, after a meeting of the ECB Governing Council, President Draghi offered the
v
e broad outlines of a new intervention framework. The ECB might purchase sovereign debt in
D
secondary markets, but only if the beneficiary government first obtains a financial assistance
n
o program from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) or the European Stability
c
E Mechanism (ESM), submits to “strict and effective conditionality” and policy monitoring
l
t ’ under this program, and adheres to its policy commitments. President Draghi also noted
n
I that the ECB’s purchases of sovereign debt will focus on the shorter end of the yield curve.
In addition, he suggested that the ECB will divulge the country breakdown as well as the
aggregate amount of its bond purchases. Finally, the ECB will address concerns about its
seniority vis‐à‐vis private creditors, which is viewed as damping investor interest in sovereign
debt.
However, it remains unclear whether intervention will aim (implicitly if not explicitly) to cap
spreads or yields and how much the ECB will be willing to purchase to achieve its aims. The
extent of policy conditionality and monitoring required is also unclear. Some ECB officials
might prefer stricter conditionality in order to mitigate moral hazard, but that would also
increase stigma and thus make the Italian and Spanish governments less likely to request
assistance. At present, these governments are awaiting further clarity on the terms and
preconditions for EFSF–ESM financial assistance and ECB intervention. Negotiations over
these issues are likely to drag on for some time and could be more complicated if the
German Constitutional Court determines the law authorizing Germany’s participation in the
ESM to be unconstitutional (a provisional ruling is expected on September 12). Were these
negotiations to break down so that chances of ECB intervention dwindled, that would likely
substantially disrupt financial markets.
In addition to considering requesting general financial support from the EFSF or ESM, Spain
is also implementing its existing EFSF–ESM program to recapitalize its banks. On August 31,
Spain approved a new law that strengthens its bank restructuring and resolution framework
and establishes a “bad bank” to be a repository of troubled assets. Also, one of Spain’s

largest banks, BFA‐Bankia, revealed larger‐than‐expected losses, immediately prompting the
Spanish government to announce a bridge recapitalization pending a more comprehensive
resolution of BFA‐Bankia’s problems. It remains uncertain how the costs of restructuring
BFA‐Bankia and other banks will be shared among private shareholders, creditors, and the
Spanish government.
With vulnerable euro‐area banks in the spotlight, markets are anticipating the European
Commission’s proposal for a European banking union (expected in mid‐September). A single
supervisory mechanism for European banks is a prerequisite for the ESM to directly
recapitalize euro‐area banks (at present, the EFSF and ESM can only recapitalize banks
indirectly via loans to governments, which further increase sovereign debt burdens) and is
also expected to precede the creation of euro‐area–wide deposit insurance and bank
k
resolution funds. European authorities envision a centralized supervisory structure where o
o
the ECB will have the necessary powers for supervising euro‐area banks but will delegate l
t
u
day‐to‐day financial supervision to national authorities and relevant agencies. European O
officials hope that establishment of the supervisory mechanism can begin in January 2013, &
but there is significant uncertainty regarding the implementation and timing of this initiative. l

Finally, investor concerns about Greece have moderated recently as the near‐term prospects D
for Greece’s financial assistance program have improved. The new Greek government has n
o
been working to reinvigorate the austerity and reform initiatives that stalled before c
E
elections this spring, and Greece’s official creditors appear willing to provide some time for l
’
t
these efforts to bear fruit. In early August, the ECB increased the amount of Greek Treasury n
I
bills the Bank of Greece can accept as collateral in exchange for emergency liquidity
assistance loans. This increase enabled the Greek government to sell additional bills to the
country’s banks and to use the proceeds to redeem €3.2 billion of maturing bonds owned
primarily by the ECB. Provided the Greek government continues to make progress, we
expect its official creditors to approve another long‐delayed disbursement of EFSF and IMF
funds in October. More generally, we expect European policymakers to defer for some time
the more difficult decisions regarding Greece (such as whether to expand Greece’s package
of financial assistance). However, the longer‐term prospects for Greece’s program and euro‐
area membership remain highly uncertain.

leading any deterioration in financial conditions to be smaller and less persistent than we
assumed in the July Tealbook.
By next year, we assume financial stresses will start to ease on a more sustained
basis, but this assumption depends on further progress in other areas of Europe’s policy
agenda. We anticipate that Greece and its official creditors will reach agreement that
unlocks the next aid disbursement some time this fall, thereby providing European
leaders with some breathing room to strengthen the backstops against a Greek exit.
European leaders will likely further advance their plans for fiscal and financial union.
Finally, peripheral governments will continue to implement budget cuts and structural
k
o
reforms. However, progress in all of these areas will be difficult and slow, and so strains
o
l
t
u will remain elevated for a considerable period.
O
&
e l We expect euro-area inflation to rise to 2¼ percent in the third quarter from about
v
e
D 2 percent in the second quarter, boosted in part by rising energy prices. Against a
n
o backdrop of weak growth throughout the forecast horizon, we expect inflation to fall to
c
E
1½ percent in 2013 and 2014. This path is roughly unchanged from that in the July
l
’
t
n Tealbook.
I
At its August meeting, the ECB left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at
0.75 percent, signaled readiness to use further nonstandard policy measures, and began to
define a framework for intervention in secondary bond markets. We still expect the ECB
to further enhance its liquidity support to banks and to reduce its main policy rate to
0.5 percent in the near term, possibly as early as at its September 6 meeting.
United Kingdom
The U.K. economy shrank 1.8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, the
third consecutive quarterly decline. Temporary factors, including the loss of a working
day during the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, contributed to the contraction in the second
quarter, but ongoing fiscal consolidation and negative spillovers from the euro-area crisis
are also restraining economic activity. Moreover, survey indicators point to further
weakness in the near term. Notably, the manufacturing PMI remained in contractionary
territory and confidence indicators stood at low levels through August. Accordingly,
despite the upward revision to the euro-area outlook, we marked down U.K. GDP growth
a bit over the forecast period. We now see the U.K. economy expanding at a modest
Page 44 of 110

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 5, 2012
1¼ percent average rate in the second half of 2012, partly because of a temporary boost
from the Olympics, before picking up to 2¼ percent by 2014.
After having dipped from 2 percent in the first quarter to 1.1 percent in the
second, we expect U.K. inflation to rise to slightly above 3 percent in the second half of
this year, boosted by the recent rise in oil prices and a planned increase in tuition fees.
Thereafter, inflation should settle just below 1¾ percent, restrained by ample resource
slack. Given the economy’s slower growth prospects, we expect the BOE to increase its
quantitative easing program by £50 billion to £425 billion (28 percent of GDP) this fall,
£25 billion more than assumed in the July Tealbook. Monetary policy conditions should
k
remain exceptionally accommodative, with no asset sales or hikes in the Bank Rate from o
o
l
t
its current level of 0.5 percent expected over the forecast period. u
O
&
Japan e l
v
e
Japanese real GDP growth slowed from 5.5 percent in the first quarter to D
n
1.4 percent in the second. This slowdown, which reflected softer exports and private o
c
E
consumption, was nearly 1 percentage point sharper than we had anticipated. The effect
l
’
t
of the fiscal stimulus that had boosted growth in the first half of the year is rapidly fading, n
I
and recent economic indicators have been decidedly weaker than we had expected. In
July, retail sales, exports, and industrial production dropped sharply, and in August, the
manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since the aftermath of the March 2011
earthquake and tsunami. Thus, we revised down our forecast of third-quarter growth to
negative ½ percent. Japanese GDP should start growing again beginning next quarter
and accelerate to a 1½ percent pace by the end of 2013, supported by the recent
depreciation of the yen and a gradual recovery of the global economy. In 2014, we
expect growth to slow to ¾ percent in response to the planned consumption tax hike.
Japanese consumer prices declined 1 percent in the second quarter, largely
reflecting a drop in retail food prices. Core prices, however, were little changed,
suggesting that Japan continued to slowly exit from deflation. We now expect consumer
prices to be about flat in 2013 before rising 1¾ percent in 2014, boosted by the
3 percentage point hike in the consumption tax rate. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept
policy on hold at its August meeting. However, amid persistent output slack and inflation
that remains below their 1 percent goal, we continue to assume that the BOJ will expand
its asset purchase program by a further ¥20 trillion (about 4 percent of GDP) starting later
this year.

Canada
Canada’s real GDP rose 1¾ percent in the second quarter, about the same pace as
in the previous two quarters, and in line with our previous forecast. Recent data are a
touch weaker than we had expected. Retail sales ebbed in June. In July, the
unemployment rate inched up to 7.3 percent, while the manufacturing PMI slipped a bit
but remained in expansionary territory. Accordingly, we marked down Canadian GDP
growth slightly in the second half of this year, to 1¾ percent. We continue to see GDP
expanding at about 2 percent in 2013, with growth picking up to 2½ percent in 2014 as
global economic conditions improve.
k
o
o Canadian consumer prices unexpectedly fell for the third straight month in July,
l
t
u
led by declines in the prices of energy, clothing, and footwear, driving our forecast for
O
& third-quarter inflation down into negative territory. Next quarter, we project that the
l
e
v pass-through of the recent oil prices increases will push up inflation to 2½ percent,
e
D
½ percentage point higher than in the July Tealbook. Thereafter, our inflation forecast is
n
o
c little changed near 2 percent in 2013 and 2014. Given modest inflation prospects, we
E
’ l anticipate, as in the previous Tealbook, that the Bank of Canada will keep its target for
t
n
I the overnight rate at 1 percent until mid-2014.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
With nearly all of the real GDP data in hand, we now estimate that growth in the
emerging market economies (EMEs) slowed to an annual rate of 4 percent in the second
quarter, a little below our estimate of trend growth, and about in line with our July
Tealbook forecast. Indicators for the third quarter are generally coming in somewhat
weaker than we had expected, including in China, with exports showing particular
weakness. Mexico is an important exception, with overall third-quarter indicators,
including the PMI and consumer confidence, continuing to show surprising strength. All
told, we project economic activity in the EMEs to continue expanding at about a
4 percent pace in the second half of this year, down slightly from the July Tealbook, with
somewhat faster-than-anticipated economic growth in Mexico (which has a high weight
in our EME aggregate) partially offsetting slower-than-expected growth in most other
countries.
Looking further ahead, real GDP growth in the EMEs is expected to pick up to
about 4¾ percent by 2014, supported by the end of the recession in Europe and an
acceleration of the recovery in the United States. This forecast is a touch higher than in
Page 46 of 110

--- Page 50 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 5, 2012
the July Tealbook, primarily reflecting an upward revision to Mexican growth based on a
more upbeat outlook for U.S. manufacturing production. However, as we have
highlighted in the past several Tealbooks, there are a number of important downside risks
to the outlook for the EMEs, including a significant deterioration of the situation in
Europe, a sharp slowing of the U.S. economy, and a hard landing in China.
We project that headline inflation in the EMEs slowed from 3 percent in the
second quarter to 2¾ percent in the third quarter, with a decline in inflation in Asia more
than offsetting an increase in Latin America. We expect aggregate EME inflation to rise
to 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter and remain at about that rate thereafter. This
k
projection is a little higher over the next quarter than in the previous Tealbook, owing o
o
l
t
mainly to recent increases in oil prices, but is little changed thereafter. Since the previous u
O
Tealbook, the central banks of Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines have lowered &
l
monetary policy rates, and we continue to expect some additional policy easing in China, e
v
e
India, and South Korea over the next few months. D
n
o
c
E
China
l
’
t
Chinese data since the July Tealbook have been a bit weaker than we had n
I
anticipated. Retail sales and investment growth held up in July, but exports were quite
weak and the August official PMI dipped to 49.2, the first reading below 50 since late last
year. Consequently, we now project that real GDP growth in the second half of this year
will remain subdued (by Chinese standards) at the second-quarter pace of 7½ percent,
about ¼ percentage point slower than in the July Tealbook. Output growth should then
strengthen to a rate of 8¼ percent by the end of 2014, supported by monetary and fiscal
policy stimulus and a gradual improvement in global demand. Although the elevated
level of housing prices, along with substantial vacant floor space, continues to pose the
risk of a sharp fall in Chinese growth, there has been little recent evidence that such a
bust is in train, and the authorities continue to have the fiscal and monetary scope to
support demand in such an event.
Chinese consumer price inflation fell a bit more than expected in July, as
domestic food price inflation continued to retrace its increases earlier in the year.
Accordingly, we now project a headline inflation rate of just 1¼ percent at an annual rate
in the current quarter, ½ percentage point less than in the previous Tealbook. With food
price inflation bottoming out and oil prices having risen, inflation will likely increase to
2¾ percent next quarter. We project it to edge up further to 3 percent by 2014 as
Page 47 of 110

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 5, 2012
economic activity accelerates and wage growth remains strong. Amid relatively subdued
inflation and near-term concerns about economic growth, Chinese authorities are
expected to announce some additional monetary and fiscal accommodation in the coming
quarters.
Other Emerging Asia
Second-quarter GDP data indicate that activity in the rest of emerging Asia
decelerated to about 3½ percent at an annual rate, ¼ percentage point below our July
Tealbook projection and well below its trend pace. We would have expected a rebound
from this low growth in the near term, but indicators for the third quarter have surprised
k
o
o on the downside, particularly exports. Accordingly, we marked down real GDP growth
l
t
u
O in the region, which is now expected to remain at 3½ percent in the second half of this
& year. Further out, growth is projected to rise to 4¾ percent in 2014, supported by
l
e
v accommodative policies and the firming of global economic activity.
e
D
n
o We project that headline inflation in the region will slow to 2½ percent at an
c
E
annual rate in the current quarter—about ¾ percentage point below our forecast in the
l
’
t
n
I July Tealbook—reflecting mainly a dip in food price inflation. Next quarter, food price
inflation is expected to rebound, which, along with the recent increases in oil crude oil
prices, should push up overall inflation to 3½ percent. Thereafter, inflation is expected to
average about 3¼ percent, little changed from the previous forecast.
Latin America
In Mexico, real GDP growth slowed in the second quarter to an annual rate of
3½ percent from almost 5 percent in the first quarter. The decline was less than we had
expected in the July Tealbook, partly reflecting surprising strength in the services sector.
The moderation in U.S. manufacturing growth from earlier this year, along with recent
Mexican data, point to some further decline in growth this quarter and next. Although
manufacturing PMI rose to 55 in August, exports in July picked up only a bit from their
weak June level. We project that Mexican economic growth will average 3¼ percent in
the second half of this year before edging up to just above 3½ percent in 2014, as the
trajectory of U.S. manufacturing output picks up. Relative to the July Tealbook, this
projection is up ½ percentage point over the forecast period, largely reflecting an upward
revision to the outlook for U.S. manufacturing production.

For South America, real GDP growth slowed to 2½ percent in the second quarter
from 3 percent in the first, primarily reflecting a sharp decline in Venezuelan growth. In
the third quarter, we project the region’s output will rise 2¾ percent as Venezuelan
growth rebounds and economic activity picks up in Brazil. Going forward, South
American real GDP growth should pick up further to about 4 percent by the end of the
forecast period.
After a meager performance in the second half of last year and early this year,
Brazilian real GDP growth picked up to 1½ percent in the second quarter, a bit below our
July Tealbook forecast. Growth was supported by robust domestic demand, notably
k
consumption, which more than offset a sharp contraction in exports. The second-quarter o
o
l
t
performance suggests that the stimulative policies enacted earlier are finally beginning to u
O
have some effect. Going forward, these policies, along with the gradual recovery in the &
l
advanced economies, should help lift growth to slightly above 4 percent by the end of the e
v
e
2014. In mid-August, Brazil’s government announced an infrastructure spending D
n
program amounting on average to about ¼ percent of GDP over the next five years. In o
c
E
late August, the central bank again cut its policy rate 50 basis points to a new historic low
l
’
t
n
of 7.5 percent. I
Mexican inflation has been increasing since May, reflecting in part rising food
prices related to the drought in North America. We now project that Mexican headline
consumer prices in the third quarter will increase at an annual rate of 5¼ percent, up from
2½ percent in the second quarter and about ½ percentage point above our forecast in the
July Tealbook. As food price pressures abate, however, we expect Mexican inflation to
average about 3¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period. Rising domestic
food prices have also pushed up inflation in Brazil. We project Brazilian inflation will
reach 6 percent in the current quarter, dip to 5 percent in the fourth quarter as food price
inflation subsides, and then average about 5½ percent over the remainder of the forecast
period.

Financial Developments
Sentiment in domestic financial markets improved a bit, on balance, over the
intermeeting period, reflecting generally better-than-expected domestic economic data
releases, somewhat-reduced concerns about the situation in Europe, and expectations of
more-accommodative monetary policy. Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices rose about
2 percent, near-term option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index decreased a little,
spreads on corporate bonds narrowed slightly, and unsecured short-term dollar funding
markets remained stable.
The expected path of the federal funds rate moved up early in the period in
response to the August FOMC statement and subsequent economic data releases that
came in above market expectations. However, the release of the minutes of the August
FOMC meeting and the Chairman’s recent speech at the Jackson Hole economic
symposium reportedly caused market participants to mark up their expectations of
additional monetary policy accommodation. On net over the intermeeting period, the
expected path of the federal funds rate edged down. Yields on short-dated nominal
Treasury securities were little changed, while longer-dated Treasury yields increased a
bit. Measures of inflation compensation over the next five years moved up, consistent
s
with rises in the prices of some key commodities. t
n
e

sharply. The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar decreased.
On the whole, financing flows in the United States remained strong in recent
months, particularly for the nonfinancial corporate sector. Investment- and
speculative-grade corporate bond issuance increased in August from already robust
levels, and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to grow briskly. In the
household sector, nonrevolving consumer credit again expanded significantly in the
second quarter, but the growth of revolving credit remained subdued. Mortgage

refinancing activity edged up in August as interest rates stayed low, but conventional
mortgages remained difficult to obtain for households with less-than-pristine credit
scores.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
Rates on money market futures and Treasury yields both moved up notably
following the August FOMC statement, reportedly because investors had put some odds
on a change in the forward-guidance language that would push back the anticipated date
of liftoff for the federal funds rate. Interest rates increased further in the following
weeks, reflecting reduced investor concerns about the crisis in Europe and domestic
economic data releases that were read by market participants as somewhat better than
expected. In contrast, the tone of the August FOMC minutes was viewed as somewhat
more accommodative than anticipated and led to some declines in futures rates and
Treasury yields. Subsequently, the Chairman’s August 31 speech at the economic
symposium in Jackson Hole apparently reinforced expectations of additional policy
action.
On net over the intermeeting period, the near-term expected path of the federal
funds rate derived from OIS rates was little changed, but the path edged down a few basis
points beyond mid-2015. The expected policy path now first rises to levels above the
s
t
current target range between the third and fourth quarters of 2014, slightly later than at n
e
m
the time of the August FOMC meeting. The estimated modal policy path—the most p

the most likely time of the first increase in the target rate, two quarters later than in the
August survey. In addition, dealers revised up the probability that the FOMC will extend
the period of its forward rate guidance at the upcoming meeting from 40 percent to
75 percent and the probability that the FOMC will announce additional asset purchases

from 25 percent to 55 percent compared with the August survey, but continued to attach
low odds to a reduction in the rate of interest on excess reserves.
Nominal Treasury yields also increased a little, on net, particularly at longer
maturities, and the yield curve steepened a bit, with 2-year yields about unchanged and
10- to 30-year yields increasing about 8 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.
The TIPS-based 5-year measure of inflation compensation increased 10 basis points, on
net, over the intermeeting period, while the forward measure of inflation compensation
for the next 5 years edged down. The increase in the 5-year measure is consistent with
the recent rise in the prices of oil and some other commodities. Swaps- and caps-based
measures of inflation compensation showed similar patterns.

extension program, as well as reinvestment of principal payments from its holdings of
agency securities, continued to proceed as planned and did not appear to have any
material adverse effect on market functioning.2 Most measures of liquidity conditions in
Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets remained stable over the
intermeeting period.3

Investors were reassured by a statement ECB President Draghi delivered a few days

2 The Federal Reserve purchased $50 billion, sold $39 billion, and redeemed $12 billion of n c
a
Treasury securities over the intermeeting period under the maturity extension program; the average n
i
maturity of SOMA Treasury holdings has lengthened by about 3½ years since the beginning of the program F
last September. In addition, the Federal Reserve reinvested $31 billion in agency mortgage-backed
securities from principal payments from its holdings of agency securities.
3 MBS yields showed little reaction to the announced changes to the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreements (“keepwell” agreements) between the Treasury Department and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
in mid-August. Under the new terms, the 10 percent dividend payment that the GSEs made to the Treasury
each year is replaced with a quarterly sweep of all GSE profits. With the expiration of the unlimited capital
support provisions of the keepwell agreements at the end of this year, Fannie Mae has $125 billion in
capital support remaining after 2012, whereas Freddie Mac has $149 billion in capital support remaining.
The elimination of the 10 percent dividend after 2012 makes additional capital injections from the Treasury
less likely.

reported that the ECB was considering possible measures to ease policy and offered a
broad outline of a plan for the ECB to make secondary-market purchases of short-term
sovereign debt of countries that had reached an agreement for fiscal support from the
European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism. Spreads of
yields on two-year Spanish and Italian sovereign debt over German bunds have declined
about 230 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, since the FOMC meeting, while
longer-term spreads have declined more modestly. Negotiations over further aid
continued between the Greek government and the European Union, the ECB, and the
IMF as Greece sought additional time to meet its fiscal goals. Amid mounting
expectations that Greece’s creditors will postpone difficult decisions for some time,
10-year Greek yields declined about 350 basis points over the period to near 22 percent.
Consistent with the improved risk sentiment, funding conditions for euro-area
banks eased, though funding conditions remained fragile. A few of the larger euro-area
banks that had been out of the unsecured debt markets were able to return in recent weeks
as market conditions improved. The spread between three-month EURIBOR and the OIS
rate narrowed roughly 10 basis points, and the three-month euro–dollar implied basis
spread also narrowed about 10 basis points to less than 20 basis points, its lowest level
since June 2011. Dollar borrowings at the ECB’s liquidity swap facility with the Federal
Reserve fell about $12 billion to near $19 billion. In the United Kingdom, sterling
s
t LIBOR–OIS spreads and bank lending rates have also declined, which Bank of England

markets in other advanced foreign economies: Stock prices in Japan and the United
Kingdom also rose modestly. However, China’s Shanghai composite index declined
3 percent, on net, reaching its lowest level since 2009, as investors continued to worry
about a further slowdown of the Chinese economy. Equity prices in other emerging
market countries were mixed, but emerging market sovereign CDS spreads decreased
modestly, consistent with the global improvement in risk sentiment.

The staff’s broad nominal index of the exchange value of the dollar ended the
period ⅔ percent lower. The dollar depreciated against most major currencies except the
yen, as improved market sentiment led to a reversal of some flight-to-safety flows. The
dollar also declined against the Mexican peso and Brazilian real but was relatively little
changed against most currencies in emerging Asian markets. In addition to the reversal
of flight-to-safety flows, the release of the FOMC minutes also led to some modest
downward pressure on the dollar. Ten-year sovereign yields in Germany and the United
Kingdom, which had risen earlier in the period on improved risk sentiment, declined
along with U.S. Treasury yields after the release of the FOMC minutes.
Recent TIC data indicate that private foreign investors continued to buy Treasury
securities in July, at roughly the same pace as in the second quarter. Foreign private
appetite for U.S. corporate securities rebounded somewhat in July as investors returned to
net purchases of U.S. equities while selling fewer U.S. corporate bonds. Foreign official
investors also continued to acquire Treasury securities in July, at about the pace seen
since the beginning of the year. More-recent data on custody holdings at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York indicate further official inflows in August.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Equity prices for large domestic banks rose roughly 5 percent over the
s
t
intermeeting period, and CDS spreads for the largest bank holding companies continued n
e
m
to move down. Even so, for a number of institutions, these spreads remained in the p
o
elevated ranges seen since the summer of 2011. Conditions in unsecured short-term e l
v
e
dollar funding markets remained stable. LIBOR–OIS spreads and the spread between the D
l
three-month forward rate agreement and the OIS rate three to six months ahead—a a
i
c
n
forward-looking measure of potential funding pressures—were about unchanged on net. a
n
i
Market participants continued to report tiering among European institutions in unsecured F
dollar funding markets, and suggested also that higher-quality names have recently been
able to obtain funding at somewhat longer terms.
The average maturity of unsecured financial commercial paper (CP) issued by
institutions with European parents as well as that issued by institutions with U.S. parents
lengthened somewhat over the period. Even so, the average maturity of unsecured
financial CP issued by institutions with European parents remained lower than that for
institutions with U.S. parents. The spreads of yields on highly rated unsecured CP issued

by financial firms over yields on highly rated nonfinancial issues were little changed at
low levels.
Conditions in secured funding markets were generally little changed over the
intermeeting period. In the triparty market, volumes ticked up, reflecting increased
activity across a range of collateral types, while Treasury general collateral finance
repurchase agreement (GCF repo) rates were roughly unchanged on balance. Data on
recently introduced futures contracts tied to the DTCC Treasury GCF Repo Index
indicate that market participants expect repo rates to remain in the neighborhood of
20 basis points for the remainder of the year. In the bilateral market, haircuts on
non-OMO-eligible collateral reportedly narrowed a bit over the period. In asset-backed
commercial paper (ABCP) markets, volumes outstanding remained stable over the
intermeeting period for programs with sponsors domiciled in the United States or Europe.
However, the spreads of overnight yields on ABCP with European parents over yields on
highly rated nonfinancial unsecured CP increased, while those on ABCP with U.S.
parents were little changed. Money market funds (MMFs) increased their exposures to
European counterparties a bit in July, mostly through government-security repo contracts.
The direct exposures of U.S. MMFs to Europe remained sizable at $756 billion, including
$326 billion in euro-zone holdings, dominated by French, German, and Dutch issuers.
In response to the September 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on s

demand for funding of agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.

concerns about Europe. The staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected real
equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the
equity premium—narrowed slightly but remained very wide by historical standards. An
index of option-implied one-month-ahead volatility for the S&P 500 index, the VIX, fell
in early August to levels not seen since mid-2007 and ended the period a little lower on
net. However, option-implied volatility 12 months ahead moved up slightly and is
somewhat more elevated relative to historical norms, suggesting that market participants
are less sanguine about risks to equity market performance over the medium term.
The reporting season for second-quarter earnings drew to a close over the
intermeeting period but did not leave a visible imprint on aggregate stock market prices.
Although the majority of firms in the S&P 500 index reported earnings that were higher
than private-sector forecasts, many reported revenues that failed to meet expectations,
reportedly prompting some concerns about growth going forward. An index of revisions
to analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms remained modestly
negative through the four-week period ending in mid-August.
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade
corporate bonds were little changed at near-record-low levels. The spread of yields on
corporate bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities edged down but
remained elevated relative to historical norms. The spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured s

and August, the volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds downgraded by Moody’s
Investors Service exceeded the volume of bonds upgraded, but the overall pace of
downgrades was modest. The six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms
remained low in July, and the C&I loan delinquency rate decreased further in the second
quarter. The expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s
KMV model edged down in August from moderately elevated levels.

Net debt issuance by nonfinancial firms remained strong over the intermeeting
period. The pace of investment- and speculative-grade bond issuance picked up notably
in August from an already robust pace in July. Many nonfinancial issuers reported that
they intended to use the proceeds to pay down other debt. The volume of C&I loans
outstanding increased further in August, while the volume of nonfinancial CP outstanding
was little changed on net.
In the syndicated leveraged loan market, gross issuance of institutional loans
reportedly remained solid in July and August following its strong pace in the first half of
the year—and contrary to expectations for a significant summer slowdown. In addition,
issuance of collateralized loan obligations continued apace and remained on track to post
its strongest year since 2007, reportedly supported by interest on the part of a wide range
of institutional investors. Secondary-market prices for leveraged loans were up a touch
over the intermeeting period.
The pace of gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms increased slightly
but remained subdued in August. The pace of equity retirements through cash-financed
mergers by nonfinancial firms picked up some in the second quarter, boosted by a
handful of very large deals, and share repurchases continued to be robust, leaving net
equity issuance deeply negative through the second quarter. However, announcements of
new mergers and share repurchase programs suggest that the pace of equity retirements s

will likely moderate over the rest of the year. e

mortgage rates were little changed, on net, at very low levels, with the interest rate on
30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages hovering around 3½ percent. Even so,
mortgage originations for home purchase have been about flat. Refinance originations
increased in August but remained muted relative to the prediction of staff models,

reflecting tight underwriting conditions, consolidation in the mortgage origination sector,
and low levels of home equity.
Aggregate indexes of house prices continued to increase, with the CoreLogic
index increasing for the seventh consecutive month in July. This index is now roughly
4 percent higher than its year-earlier value and almost 5½ percent higher than its low at
the end of last year. Although the rate at which mortgages are entering delinquency has
been trending down, likely reflecting the tight underwriting conditions that have
prevailed for the past few years, the fraction of existing mortgages that are seriously
delinquent remains very elevated.
Nonrevolving credit continued to grow briskly in June, owing to robust growth in
student loans originated by the federal government and, to a lesser extent, solid growth in
auto loans made by private lenders. In contrast, the surge in revolving credit in May was
partly reversed in June, leaving growth in the second quarter overall near zero. Data on
mail solicitations suggest that growth in revolving credit will remain subdued in the near
term. Delinquency rates for consumer credit stayed low, especially for revolving credit,
largely due to a compositional shift of credit supply toward higher-credit-quality
borrowers. Issuance of consumer ABS in July exceeded the elevated rate observed in the
second quarter but declined somewhat in August, partly reflecting seasonal patterns.

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds picked up in August from its
somewhat subdued pace in July, but net issuance of long-term bonds remained negative,
reflecting outsized bond retirements by state and local governments. The number of
municipal bonds downgraded by Moody’s increased in the second quarter to its highest
quarterly reading in over 10 years, partly reflecting downgrades of a large number of
bonds from the recently dissolved redevelopment authorities in California; the number of
upgrades was relatively modest. However, default rates on municipal bonds remained
very low. In addition, CDS spreads for states moved lower over the intermeeting period,

comparable-maturity Treasury securities decreased on net.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
Bank credit grew at about the same moderate pace over July and August as it had
over the first half of the year. Growth in total loans remained sluggish, reflecting
offsetting developments within major loan categories. C&I loans continued to increase
briskly, but CRE and home equity loans remained on a downtrend. Closed-end
residential mortgages grew only modestly, despite historically low mortgage rates, held
down in part by robust sales to the GSEs. Consumer loans were about flat as credit card
loans declined and other consumer loans continued to increase. Noncore loans have
slowed of late, mainly reflecting reduced repo activity with nonbanks. Banks’ holdings
of securities expanded rapidly in July and August, mainly because of one large bank’s
acquisition of a sizable amount of Treasury securities in early July. On the funding side,
domestic banks generally continued to experience inflows of core deposits while they
reduced their managed liabilities. (See the box “Bank Funding Consultations.”)
According to the Survey of Terms of Business Lending that was conducted in
August, spreads on C&I loans were little changed, as a further slight reduction in spreads
at domestic banks was largely offset by higher spreads on loans originated by U.S.
s
t
branches and agencies of foreign banks. In addition, the average maturity of C&I loans n
e
m
originated during the survey week remained at a level that is considerably higher than its p
o
l
pre-recession peak. e
v
e
D
Call Report data and bank holding company filings indicated that profitability a l
i
c
measures at domestic banking institutions were little changed in the second quarter. The n
a
n
industry-wide return on assets ticked up but remained below its average in the decade i
F
prior to the financial crisis. Low net interest margins and stagnant noninterest income
again depressed aggregate net income. The rate of loan loss provisioning continued to
decline from its 2009 peak but appears to have stabilized in recent quarters at a level that
is a bit above its pre-crisis average. Measures of credit quality generally improved
further in the second quarter, as delinquency and charge-off rates declined for all loan
categories except for residential real estate. While loans outstanding grew modestly,
unused commitments to fund loans contracted, leaving the sum of the two—banks’
aggregate lending capacity—about flat. Aggregate regulatory capital ratios remained
near their recent highs.

Bank Funding Consultations
In mid‐August, the Federal Reserve System conducted an informal survey on special topics
regarding bank funding conditions with nine banks, mostly very large institutions. The
survey asked banks about their likely reaction to the expiration at the end of 2012 of
unlimited insurance on noninterest‐bearing transaction deposits under the Dodd–Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd–Frank Act) and the maturation
of long‐term debt issued under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP).1
Overall, the respondents were not notably concerned about the expiration of either
program at year‐end, generally citing sufficient access to low‐cost funding to meet
anticipated loan demand.
Noninterest‐bearing transaction accounts have been insured in unlimited amounts at all
banks by the FDIC during 2011 and 2012, as provided for in the Dodd–Frank Act. Prior to that,
the same insurance was available to banks participating in the Transaction Account
Guarantee Program (a component of the TLGP), but many banks opted out of that coverage
during 2010. Since the Dodd–Frank insurance came into effect on December 31, 2010,
commercial banks’ holdings of deposits covered by this insurance have increased 56 percent
(see the figure below), and as of the end of the second quarter of 2012, they accounted for
nearly 19½ percent of the industry’s total domestic deposits, up from about 14½ percent at
the end of the fourth quarter of 2010.
The survey results suggest that the temporary insurance has not been the only factor
behind the rise in noninterest‐bearing transaction deposits over the past two years. The
respondents unanimously cited the importance of depositors’ increased preferences for safe
s
t
n and liquid assets, while two‐thirds cited the temporary insurance. Four banks also

The consultations also included a third set of questions regarding the Bank of England’s Funding for
Lending Scheme; see the memo to be sent to the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of
the Reserve Banks, “Discount Window Options to Encourage Bank Lending.”

holding liquid assets of this sort. Consistent with the importance of these non‐insurance
factors, the respondents generally did not expect to lose large amounts of these deposits
after the insurance expires at the end of this year.2 As a result, only about half of the
respondents plan to take any steps to retain insurance‐related deposits, mostly by marketing
other banking services rather than by raising deposit interest rates or reducing fees on
deposit accounts.
Of the six respondents that viewed insurance coverage as an important factor behind the
inflows of these deposits, five cited state and local governments as responsible for an
important share of the insurance‐related inflows. Respondents also indicated that the
insurance‐related inflows came from large corporations and to a lesser extent from
customers that must invest exclusively in government‐guaranteed investments.
Finally, the respondents widely indicated that the insurance‐related inflows of additional
noninterest‐bearing transaction deposits have not changed their willingness to originate
new loans. Consequently, there is little to reason to believe that the expiration of this
insurance will cause these banks to tighten their lending standards or terms.
An important caveat is that these results may not be representative of the funding situation
at smaller banks. In particular, community bank trade groups have argued that the unlimited
insurance on noninterest‐bearing transaction accounts has been important for those
institutions’ ability to compete with larger banks for deposits, and as a result these groups
have been lobbying for extending the coverage past year‐end, though the chances for such
an extension remain uncertain.

With respect to long‐term debt, financial institutions issued debt guaranteed by the FDIC m
p
between October 14, 2008, and October 31, 2009, through the Debt Guarantee Program, a o
l
part of the TLGP. Much of this debt has matured, mostly in the past year, and only a small e
v
e
amount is still outstanding, all of which will mature before the FDIC’s guarantee expires on D
December 31, 2012. Of the nine survey respondents, six used the TLGP to issue long‐term l
a
i
debt (defined here as debt with a duration of at least one year). Despite the maturation of c
n
the debt issued under the TLGP, these respondents reported no plans to issue new long‐ a
n
i
term debt over the remainder of the year. Two have already replaced their maturing long‐ F
term TLGP debt, and the others have decided not to replace it. In deciding to not issue new
long‐term debt, three of these four respondents cited strategic goals to reduce the size of
their balance sheets. In addition, they also indicated they had decided to replace the
maturing debt, in part, with capital or with other liabilities—largely deposits, particularly in
the form of wholesale noninterest‐bearing transaction accounts.
2
A May 2012 survey of corporate treasurers by the Association of Financial Professionals suggests a
somewhat larger scope for outflows of these deposits, as about two‐fifths of those surveyed reported plans
to make significant reductions in their noninterest‐bearing transaction deposits.
In addition, two of the largest banks expect to shed about half of their insurance‐related deposit
inflows, consistent with an overall strategy to shrink their balance sheets. Both of these banks also
reported that they do not plan to issue new long‐term debt to replace their long‐term TLGP debt.

M2 growth was rapid in July but slowed to a moderate pace in August. Even so,
the levels of M2 balances and of liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, remained
elevated relative to what would be expected based on historical relationships with
nominal income and opportunity costs. Liquid deposits increased at an annual rate of
13¼ percent in July, likely reflecting investors’ desire to hold safe and liquid assets amid
concerns about the situation in Europe. In August, as these concerns eased somewhat,
the growth in liquid deposits fell to a bit less than half its July pace. Currency grew at
about its historical average pace in July and August, while retail MMF balances and
small time deposits continued to decline. The monetary base rose as reserve balances and
currency expanded over the period. The increase in reserve balances was driven largely
by a decrease in the Treasury’s General Account. (See the box “Balance Sheet
Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”)

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
Assets of the Federal Reserve totaled $2,816 billion at the end of the intermeeting period,
down $32 billion from the time of the previous meeting (see table on next page).
Since the August FOMC meeting, the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York (FRBNY) conducted 22 operations as part of the maturity extension program:
The Desk purchased $50 billion in Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to
30 years and sold or allowed to mature without reinvestment $51 billion in Treasury
securities with maturities of 3 years or less.1 Since the maturity extension program was
announced in September 2011, the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury
holdings has risen from 6.1 years to 9.5 years. In addition, the Desk reinvested $30 billion
of agency debt and agency MBS principal payments in agency MBS securities.2
Foreign central bank liquidity swaps declined moderately to $23 billion. The net portfolio
holdings of Maiden Lane III LLC decreased $6 billion, as all remaining securities in the
Maiden Lane III portfolio were sold on August 23. The net portfolio holdings of Maiden
Lane LLC and Maiden Lane II LLC were unchanged. As part of the closeout procedures
for Maiden Lane II, eight residual securities, which had already been marked down to
zero and dropped from the Maiden Lane II portfolio holdings report, were sold. Loans
outstanding under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility continued to decline.
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, Federal Reserve notes in
s
t
n circulation increased $14 billion, while reverse repurchase agreements with foreign
e
m official and international accounts rose slightly. On August 16, as part of its operational
p
o readiness program, the FRBNY announced updated eligibility requirements for reverse
l
v e repurchase agreement counterparties.3 The FRBNY plans to conduct small‐value reverse
e
D repurchase agreement tests in the near future. The U.S. Treasury’s General Account,
a l which is highly volatile from month to month, decreased $60 billion, and other deposits,
i
c which include GSE balances, were unchanged.4 Meanwhile, reserve balances of
n
n a depository institutions increased $17 billion.5 Term deposits held by depository
i
F institutions fell to zero, as a $3 billion small‐value operation of the Term Deposit Facility
matured on August 16, 2012.
1 Purchases of $6 billion conducted on September 4, 2012, are reflected in the text but not in the
table.
2 Because of agency MBS market conventions, settlements of these transactions can occur well
after the trade is executed.
3
For more on the eligibility criteria for reverse repurchase agreement counterparties, see
www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_eligibility_criteria.html.

During the intermeeting period, GSEs held relatively high balances at the Federal Reserve ahead of
monthly principal and interest payments.

Appendix
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms
For the most part, responses to the September 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey
on Dealer Financing Terms pointed to no significant changes in the credit terms applicable to
important classes of counterparties over the past three months, but a few dealers noted a slight
easing for some counterparties.1 Continuing a pattern observed in previous surveys, large net
fractions of respondents indicated an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to
the management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries as well as
to central counterparties and other financial market utilities. Dealers reported that the use of
financial leverage by hedge funds had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.
Sizable net fractions of respondents also noted that the provision of differential terms to
most-favored hedge funds and to trading real estate investment trusts (REITs) had increased over
the past three months. 2 For several types of counterparties, modest net fractions of dealers
reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by those counterparties to negotiate more-favorable
price and nonprice terms.
As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in
new or renegotiated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives master agreements were broadly
unchanged, on balance, during the past three months. Dealers also reported that initial margin
requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were generally little changed
over the same period. About one-fifth of respondents indicated that the posting of nonstandard
s
t
n
collateral (that is, other than cash and U.S. Treasury securities) permitted under relevant
e
m
agreements had increased somewhat.

months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
markets. In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about trends
in the types of assets posted as collateral against OTC derivatives transactions. A discussion of the
responses to the set of special questions will be provided in a separate memorandum. The 22 institutions
participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to
nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was conducted
during the period from August 14, 2012, to August 27, 2012. The core questions ask about changes
between June 2012 and August 2012.

30 days or more) for these collateral types. In contrast to the June survey, nearly two-fifths of
survey respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning in the underlying markets for
non-agency RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) had improved
somewhat over the past three months.
COUNTERPARTY TYPES
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
In the September survey, about one-third of respondents indicated that they had
increased the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated
exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries over the past three months. Among the
nine “broad-scope” dealers, which have a significant presence in essentially all of the business
areas covered in the survey, a similar share reported increasing resources and attention to
management of these concentrated exposures. In the June survey, about one-half of respondents
had reported such an increase. These responses point to continued elevated concerns about the
condition of financial institutions, while the reduction in share since June also appears to reflect
in part the recent apparent easing of anxiety about the crisis in Europe.
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities
Nearly two-thirds of dealers indicated that they had increased the amount of resources
and attention each of their firms devoted to management of concentrated credit exposure to
central counterparties and other financial utilities over the past three months, roughly the same
share as in the previous survey. All but two of the nine broad-scope dealers reported an increase.
Of note, about one-fourth of all of the respondents indicated that changes in the practices of
s
t
n
central counterparties, including changes in margin requirements and haircuts, had influenced to

financing and OTC derivative transactions had remained basically unchanged over the past three
months. About one-fourth of dealers noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of
efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the same
period—the same fraction as in the June survey. Nearly all dealers indicated that the use of
leverage by hedge funds had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, a different
pattern of responses from surveys earlier in the year when modest fractions of respondents had
pointed to a reduction in financial leverage. Respondents also noted that there had been little
change, on net, in the availability of additional financial leverage under agreements currently in
place with hedge funds, which gives those funds the ability to rapidly increase their use of
leverage should they choose to do so. About one-fourth of dealers indicated that the provision of

differential terms to most-favored (as a function of breadth, duration, and extent of relationship)
hedge funds had increased over the past three months.
Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts
About one-fifth of dealers indicated in the September survey that they had eased nonprice
terms offered to trading REITs over the past three months, while price terms had remained
basically unchanged. More-aggressive competition from other institutions was cited as the most
important reason cited for doing so. Four of the nine broad-scope dealers reported an easing in
nonprice terms. Respondents indicated that use of financial leverage by trading REITs was little
changed, on balance, over the past three months. About one-fifth of respondents noted an
increase in the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and
nonprice terms over the past three months, and two-fifths of dealers reported an increase in the
provision of differential terms to most-favored clients.
Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments
A few dealers indicated that they had eased nonprice terms offered to mutual funds,
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, and endowments over the past three months, while
price terms were said to have remained basically unchanged. About one-fifth of dealers noted an
increase in the intensity of efforts by clients in this category to negotiate more-favorable price and
nonprice terms over the same period. Respondents to the September survey reported that use of
financial leverage by mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments was basically
unchanged over the past three months.

advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically unchanged over the past three
months. Efforts by investment advisers to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms on
behalf of separately managed accounts and the use of financial leverage by these clients were also
reported to be little changed.
Nonfinancial Corporations
A few dealers reported that they had eased price and nonprice terms offered to
nonfinancial corporations over the past three months. Only a very small net fraction of dealers

indicated that there had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by these clients to negotiate
more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.
Mark and Collateral Disputes
As in the previous survey, most respondents indicated that the volume, persistence, and
duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type included in the survey were
little changed over the past three months.
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES
As in previous surveys, dealers indicated that nonprice terms incorporated in new or
renegotiated OTC derivatives master agreements were broadly unchanged, on net, over the past
three months. 3 A few respondents, on net, reported that they had tightened somewhat
requirements, timelines, and thresholds for posting additional margin, and a few noted that they
had eased somewhat with respect to other documentation features including cure periods and
cross-default provisions. Nearly all of the dealers indicated that initial margins (which fall
outside the scope of master agreements) on contracts referencing most underlying collateral types
were little changed over the past three months. About one-fifth of respondents noted that the
posting of nonstandard collateral (that is, other than cash and U.S. Treasury securities) had
increased somewhat over the past three months. For most contract types included in the survey,
almost all of the dealers indicated that the volume, duration, and persistence of mark and
collateral disputes remained basically unchanged over the past three months. However, a few
dealers reported, on net, that the volume of mark and collateral disputes had increased for
contracts referencing foreign exchange and commodities and decreased for contracts referencing
s

share pointing to somewhat stronger demand for term funding. In contrast, demand for funding

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY
We continue to view the risks around the staff’s forecast for economic activity as
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by
the FOMC). This assessment partly reflects the U.S. financial crisis and the unusual
depth and persistence of the recession, which have uncertain implications for the
magnitude of slack in labor and product markets, the pace at which the recovery is likely
to proceed, and the resilience of the financial system. We also see elevated risks related
to the effects of the fiscal and financial situation in Europe. The staff’s baseline forecast
assumes that the European situation will eventually improve as their policymakers take
additional steps to contain the crisis. Of course, euro-area policymakers could move
more quickly and decisively to diffuse the crisis than we anticipate. However, we see a
greater risk that the European situation could deteriorate by more than assumed. In the
extreme, such a deterioration could result in a severe economic downturn in Europe with
substantial spillover effects to the domestic economy—effects that U.S. fiscal and
monetary policymakers may have limited capacities to counteract. The downside risks to
the economic outlook are also exacerbated by the “fiscal cliff” looming at the turn of the
year; fiscal policymakers, by choice or by gridlock, could impose more restraint on the
recovery than we have assumed in the baseline. Overall, we view the risks to economic
activity as skewed to the downside.
Although we continue to see substantial uncertainty around our outlook for
inflation, we do not view the risks as unusually high. Long-run inflation expectations and
the trend in actual inflation have remained relatively stable in recent years despite large
fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices and persistently wide margins of slack in
labor and product markets. Moreover, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as
balanced. On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations, possibly related to
concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a

timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a n t

further subdued increases in unit labor costs, and low levels of resource utilization could
cause inflation expectations, and thus actual inflation, to decline over time.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of the staff’s models. We start
with two downside risks to aggregate demand—first, that an even sharper fiscal
contraction than envisioned in the baseline could occur at the beginning of next year and,
second, that the European crisis intensifies with severe spillovers to the U.S. economy.
The next scenario considers the possibility of a faster improvement in the European
situation; the fourth scenario addresses the chance that the underlying pace of the U.S.
recovery may be more robust than assumed in the baseline. The last three scenarios focus
on inflation risks—in particular, that oil prices surge; that we have underestimated the
amount of labor market damage that has occurred and thus the potential for higher future
inflation; and that the headwinds slowing the recovery could prove to be more protracted
than we anticipate, causing inflation to decline to a very low level.
We generate the scenarios focused on domestic economic risks using the FRB/US
model and the scenarios initiated by risks centered on foreign events using the
multicountry SIGMA model. For the FRB/US simulations, we use the same estimated
monetary policy rule that governs the path of the federal funds rate in the baseline. For
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy rule that employs an alternative
concept of resource utilization.1 In all of the scenarios, the size and composition of the
SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow their baseline paths.
Fiscal Cliff
Our baseline projection assumes that the Congress will avert the fiscal cliff in its
most severe form, by extending the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and 2003,
continuing to shield most taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, and extending a
number of other non-stimulus-related tax reductions. In contrast, this scenario assumes
that none of these actions are taken, thereby increasing total tax payments by households y
t
n
i
and businesses next year by about 2½ percent of GDP relative to baseline. Moreover, in a

the alternative, the automatic spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act’s
sequestration provisions take full effect in 2013, further restraining federal purchases by
about ¼ percent of GDP relative to baseline.2 In addition, these fiscal policy
developments are assumed to weigh on consumer and business confidence by more than
in the baseline. As a result, real GDP expands only 1 percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in
2014, on average 1 percentage point per year slower than in the baseline.3 The
unemployment rate rises above 8½ percent in 2014. With a wider margin of resource
slack, inflation declines slightly to 1 percent in 2015, and the federal funds rate does not
begin to increase from its effective lower bound until mid-2015.
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers
In this scenario, the current economic and financial stress in Europe intensifies
sharply and causes Europe to plunge into a severe financial crisis and a deep recession.
Reflecting the greater financial stress, both sovereign and private borrowing costs in
Europe soar—with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline—and
the confidence of European households and businesses plummets. Real GDP in Europe
declines about 8½ percent relative to baseline by the end of 2013, despite a 25 percent
depreciation in the real effective exchange value of the euro. Europe’s difficulties are
assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to the rest of the world,
including the United States. U.S. economic activity contracts sharply, as U.S. corporate
bond spreads rise more than 300 basis points, equity prices plunge, credit availability is
restricted, and household and business confidence erodes. In addition, weaker foreign
economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.
In all, U.S. real GDP declines at an annual rate of more than 1 percent in the second half
of this year and 3 percent next year. The unemployment rate rises to 10¾ percent in 2014
before beginning to gradually decline. With substantially greater resource slack and
lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer prices decrease in 2013; prices begin to rise

trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that are about the same as in the baseline. However, e r
c
because those deficits follow a period of greater fiscal restraint, the ratio of government debt to GDP is n

3 Although taxes increase by more than 2 percent of GDP in 2013 in this scenario, the negative &

effect on real GDP next year is smaller as households in the FRB/US model adjust their spending gradually k

in response to the decline in their disposable income; accordingly, real GDP in 2014 is also restrained. R i

in 2014 as economic activity starts to recover.4 Under these conditions, the federal funds
rate remains at its effective lower bound until mid-2016.
Faster European Recovery
This scenario assumes that the European authorities progress more rapidly than
expected in addressing their fiscal and financial stresses and market participants react
quickly and positively. As a result, financial conditions improve more quickly than
anticipated, causing European corporate bond spreads to fall roughly 100 basis points
relative to baseline by mid-2013. In addition, household and business sentiment
improves markedly. Reflecting these developments, real GDP in Europe expands about
2 percent in 2013, rather than remaining nearly flat as in the baseline. U.S. net exports
are boosted by stronger economic activity in Europe and in other U.S. trading partners, as
well as by a depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar as safe-haven flows unwind;
more tightening of monetary policy in Europe than in the United States (relative to
baseline) also pushes down the dollar. All told, U.S. real GDP rises at a 3½ percent rate
on average over the next two years, the unemployment rate falls to about 7 percent by the
end of 2014, and core PCE inflation increases to 2 percent in 2013 and 2014. Under
these conditions, the federal funds rate begins to rise one quarter earlier than in the
baseline.
Faster Domestic Recovery
The recent stronger-than-expected gains in employment and retail sales, along
with continued increases in house prices, may point to a faster underlying pace of the
recovery than we anticipate. This scenario takes on board this possibility by assuming
that uncertainty about the durability of the recovery lifts more quickly than expected. In
addition, house values rise faster, reaching a level 10 percent above the baseline by late
2014, with favorable implications for construction, household wealth, and the willingness
of financial institutions to extend credit. These various factors, in turn, fuel a more robust
cycle of increased household and business confidence, employment, credit availability,
and spending that boosts the pace of the recovery. Real GDP accelerates to an average
y
4 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking t
n
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA and the relatively modest degree of structural inflation a i
t
persistence. In particular, long-run inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at 2 percent, marginal e r
c
costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital n
U
spending). In addition, import price inflation runs significantly higher than in the baseline as the initial
&
appreciation in the exchange value of the dollar is gradually reversed. Under alternative specifications of
s
SIGMA that, for instance, allowed for more structural persistence in the inflation process or a less firm k
s
anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period. R i

growth rate of 3¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, and the unemployment rate declines to
6¼ percent by the end of 2014. Upward pressure on inflation is initially tempered by the
effects of increased capital investment on labor productivity and unit labor costs. Over
time, however, greater resource utilization causes inflation to move up, to 2¼ percent in
2016 and 2017. In response to the higher inflation and stronger pace of real activity, the
federal funds rate lifts off earlier and stays higher than in the baseline; accordingly,
inflation will eventually settle back at the Committee’s longer-run objective.
Higher Oil Prices
The recent escalation of tensions with Iran over its nuclear program highlights the
significant upside risks to our outlook for oil prices. In this scenario, we assume that
greater geopolitical stresses and supply disruptions temporarily increase oil prices
$35 per barrel above baseline at the end of this year, but that prices then partially recede
and level out at $20 per barrel above baseline. U.S. domestic demand falls because
higher oil prices reduce households’ real incomes and lower the return on firms’
investments, while real exports also decline due to weaker foreign economic activity.
U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 1½ percent, on average, in the second half
of this year and next year, and the unemployment rate is 8 percent at the end of 2014,
nearly ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline. Reflecting the rise in energy costs,
overall PCE inflation jumps to nearly 3½ percent in the second half of this year.
However, because the public recognizes that the direct impetus of higher oil prices to
inflation is only temporary, and because they anticipate that the Federal Reserve will
maintain stable inflation over time, inflation expectations remain well anchored and
actual inflation subsequently moves back to baseline. In response to the offsetting
implications for policy of higher inflation and weaker real activity, the federal funds rate
lifts off from its effective lower bound at the same time as in the baseline but rises more
gradually thereafter.
Damaged Labor Market
The unusual depth and breadth of the downturn may have impaired the efficiency
y of labor markets by more than we judge. In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate
t
n
i of unemployment reached 7 percent in early 2011 (1 percentage point above baseline)
a
t
r
e and that it will remain at that level for the indefinite future. Furthermore, the trend labor
c
n
U force participation rate is assumed to decline more quickly, ending 2015 more than

1 percentage point below the baseline. These conditions imply lower long-run levels of
s
k
s household income and corporate earnings; as a result, underlying aggregate demand is
i
R

weaker, and the unemployment rate barely inches down over the next few years.
Nonetheless, a higher natural rate of unemployment implies that labor market slack
remains persistently narrower than in the baseline, leading to higher unit labor costs and
greater upward pressure on consumer prices. These price pressures are magnified by the
assumption that policymakers initially fail to recognize the weaker supply-side
conditions, which leads them to maintain a more accommodative stance of monetary
policy through late 2014 than they would have chosen with a more accurate assessment
of the supply side. In response, the public’s long-run inflation expectations are assumed
to move up (in contrast to the previous scenario), and thus consumer price inflation
eventually rises to 2½ percent. Largely reflecting these more inflationary conditions, the
federal funds rate begins to rise earlier than in the baseline.
Protracted Headwinds
Given the constraints on monetary policy, persistently weak aggregate demand
could eventually give rise to a self-reinforcing downward spiral in inflation. In this
scenario, concerns about the durability of the recovery fade more slowly than in the
baseline, leading firms to remain reluctant to hire and invest, and households to remain
cautious about their spending. In addition, the resolution of ongoing problems in the
housing market proves to be even more gradual than anticipated. Reflecting these
protracted headwinds, real GDP grows only 2 percent, on average, in 2013 and 2014, and
gains in real GDP remain below baseline into the second half of the decade. The
unemployment rate stays around its current elevated level for several years. In turn, the
sustained wide margins of slack in labor and product markets exert more-persistent
downward pressure on inflation than in the baseline, which eventually convinces
households and firms that they are in a new inflation environment. As a result, inflation
expectations begin to fall, giving rise to a steady decline in consumer inflation to a rate of
only ¾ percent starting in 2014. With inflation well below and the unemployment rate
far above the FOMC’s longer-run objectives, the federal funds rate is still at its effective
lower bound at the end of 2017.
