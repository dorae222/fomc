Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The data we have received since the March Tealbook suggest a slightly stronger D
n
pace of economic activity, on average, during the first half of this year than we had o
c
E
previously projected. Most importantly, the unemployment rate is a little lower, the level
c
i
t
of overall payroll employment a little higher, and consumer spending noticeably stronger s
e
m
than we had expected. That said, personal income appears to be on a weaker trajectory o
D
than we had projected in the March Tealbook, the trade data for January and February
were slightly disappointing on net, and the bump to defense spending early this year
seems likely to be unwound over the next few quarters. Moreover, we are mindful of the
possibility that the recent spending and production data have been boosted by
unseasonably warm weather and seasonal adjustment problems—a consideration that
dissuaded us from marking up the near-term projection more noticeably. After taking all
of this information into account, we now estimate that real GDP will increase at an
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of this year, ¼ percentage point more than in
the March Tealbook.
With most of the key background factors shaping our forecast little revised, the
broad contour of our projection is similar to that in the previous Tealbook. In particular,
we expect real GDP to expand at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the second half of 2012
and then to remain at that pace in 2013, as the impetus to growth from favorable financial
conditions, an improving credit environment, and rising confidence is offset by a
significant tightening in the stance of fiscal policy. In 2014, GDP growth is projected to
pick up to 3¼ percent as the drag from fiscal policy begins to recede. Given the
projected path for GDP, the unemployment rate is forecast to fall from 8¼ percent in the
current quarter to 7½ percent by the end of 2014; the path of the jobless rate is a little
lower than in the March Tealbook, mostly reflecting the lower-than-expected readings
seen in recent months.
We have nudged up our forecast for inflation relative to the March Tealbook in
response to higher-than-expected data on core consumer prices and the slightly narrower
margin of slack in this projection. We now expect core PCE price inflation to be
1.8 percent in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013 and 2014, 0.1 percentage point above our
previous projection in each year. With the passthrough of the recent run-up in oil prices
into consumer energy prices nearly complete and with oil prices expected to edge lower

D KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
In line with the staff’s outcome-based policy rule, we assume that liftoff of the
target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will occur in the first quarter of
2014, one quarter earlier than in the March Tealbook. At the same time, we assume that
the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s current portfolio-related policies, with
the timing adjusted in line with the revised liftoff date.
The path of the federal funds rate in the extended baseline projection, and in
particular the date when conventional monetary policy is assumed to begin to firm in the
staff projection, depends importantly on our use of the estimated outcome-based policy
rule. As discussed in Book B, liftoff would occur in the same quarter as in the baseline if
we had instead assumed that the federal funds rate would follow the prescriptions of the
Taylor (1999) rule. But using a rule that targets the level of nominal GDP would delay
the onset of conventional tightening until late 2014, and optimal-policy calculations
indicate postponing it until mid-2015. In contrast, the Taylor (1993) rule would call for a
higher federal funds rate right away, while the first-difference rule would call for
tightening to begin in the second half of 2013.1
Other Interest Rates
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has changed little, on net, since the
March Tealbook. We expect the 10-year Treasury yield to rise substantially from the
middle of this year through 2013 and end that year at 3¾ percent—1¾ percentage points
above its current level and about 10 basis points higher than in the March projection. In
2014, the yield is projected to increase an additional 15 basis points. This projection
1 All these estimates allow for dynamic feedback from the stance of monetary policy to the real
economy and inflation, which can have important implications for the estimated timing of tightening under
the different rules.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v
The FOMC published its most recent Survey of Economic Projections (SEP) following the e
D
January FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the staff economic
n
projection since the January Tealbook. o
c
E
c
The staff projection for real GDP growth has strengthened, on net, since January, with i
t
s
most of the revisions occurring in the March Tealbook. The revisions mainly reflect e
m
stronger incoming spending data, primarily affecting the first half of 2012, and revisions to o
D
the assumptions for equity prices, the exchange rate, and foreign growth that affect the
projection throughout the medium term. The lower projected unemployment rate
reflects both the stronger outlook for aggregate demand and incoming data that leave
the unemployment rate jumping off from a lower level than we had anticipated in January.
The staff projection for core PCE inflation has revised up about ¼ percentage point per
year since January, the result of both incoming data and the stronger projection for real
activity. The revision to overall PCE inflation also reflects the rise since January in crude oil
prices, but with our oil price projection now sloping more noticeably downward, overall
PCE inflation is currently projected to run a little below core inflation in 2013 and 2014.
With these changes to the economic outlook, the outcome‐based policy rule now calls for
the federal funds rate to move above its effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2014,
three quarters earlier than was the case in the January Tealbook.

reflects the movement of the valuation window through the period of near-zero short- u t
O
term interest rates, a gradual waning of the effects of nonconventional monetary policy,
&
and further unwinding of safe-haven demands as apprehensions related to the European e l
v
e
debt crisis abate and the durability of the U.S. economic recovery becomes more assured. D
n
o
c
Since the March Tealbook was published, spreads over comparable-maturity E
c
Treasury securities for BBB-rated corporate bonds and conforming fixed-rate mortgages t i
s
e
are about unchanged, on net. Still, both spreads are currently above their typical levels m
o
D
and are expected to narrow gradually over the medium term. Given our forecast of
Treasury yields, these assumptions imply that yields on these private instruments are
projected to increase moderately over the next three years.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have increased about 3 percent, on net, since the
March Tealbook. We now project that stock prices will rise at an annual rate of about
7 percent, on average, through the fourth quarter of 2014. The projected pace of
appreciation from here forward continues to reflect our expectation of a gradual decline
in the equity premium from historically elevated levels.
The CoreLogic house price index increased in January and February, whereas we
had expected it to continue drifting down a bit further. In response, we have revised up
our forecast for house prices noticeably and now forecast that they will rise about
2 percent in both 2012 and 2013, putting the projected level of house prices by late 2013
roughly 5 percent higher than in the March Tealbook; we project a further 2 percent
increase in 2014. This projection also reflects our continued expectation that mortgage
rates will remain low enough and rents will remain high enough to provide some support
for house prices despite the countervailing effects of tight underwriting standards and the
large stock of properties in the foreclosure pipeline that will only decline gradually.
Fiscal Policy
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essentially unchanged in this forecast and
continue to imply that federal fiscal policy will impart a noticeable drag on activity over
the medium term. In particular, we still assume that the payroll tax cut and the
Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program will expire next year as
scheduled under current law. We also continue to assume that federal discretionary
spending will be restrained this year by the caps set in the Budget Control Act. The

o
l
u t additional restraint imparted by the automatic spending cuts stipulated by that legislation
O
to take effect in January 2013 is assumed to be replaced by more-gradual budget restraint
&
e l that achieves the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal year 2021.
v
e
D Given these assumptions for federal policy, and also folding in the effects of state and
n
o local policies, we expect total fiscal policy to directly restrain real GDP growth
c
E
(excluding multiplier effects) by ¼ percentage point this year, 1 percentage point in 2013,
c
i
t
s and ¼ percentage point in 2014.
e
m
o
D
We project that the federal budget deficit will narrow from $1.3 trillion
(8¾ percent of GDP) last year to about $700 billion (4 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2014.
As in the March Tealbook, the expected narrowing of the deficit reflects the winding
down of stimulus policies, spending restraint from the Budget Control Act and the
drawdown of overseas military operations, and the effects of the pickup in the pace of the
recovery on tax receipts.
Foreign Activity and the Dollar
Real activity in the foreign economies increased at an estimated annual rate of
3¼ percent in the first quarter, up from only 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter. Much of
the step-up in growth reflected the normalization of supply chains in emerging Asia that
were disrupted by the floods in Thailand last year. Over the remainder of 2012, foreign
real GDP is expected to rise at about a 3 percent pace, as euro-area output continues to
contract in response to financial stress and fiscal retrenchment but the rest of the global
economy generally expands at a moderate pace. Beyond 2012, we expect foreign GDP
growth to gradually inch higher and reach 3½ percent by 2014, helped by continued
accommodative monetary policy, a firming U.S. recovery, and the easing of financial
stresses in Europe.
Since the March Tealbook, the dollar has edged up. From its slightly higher
starting point, we expect the broad real dollar to depreciate at about a 2¼ percent annual
rate through the end of 2014, little changed from our previous projection. As before, we
assume that the bulk of this depreciation will be against the currencies of emerging
market economies.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
Spot prices for major benchmark grades of crude oil have declined in recent
weeks, likely because of increased concerns about the strength of near-term global

l
demand. The spot price of Brent crude oil closed on April 17 at $119 per barrel, down u t
O
$5 since the time of the March Tealbook.2 Brent futures prices also generally moved
&
lower, but these declines were not as large as the drop in the spot price. That said, the e l
v
e
futures curve still slopes down, with spot prices commanding a nearly $15 premium over D
n
the price of futures for the end of 2014. Accordingly, market participants appear to view o
c
E
the current high level of prices as temporary. Our forecast for the price of imported oil
c
i
t
has shifted down in line with futures prices. We anticipate the price of imported oil will s
e
m
edge down from an estimated value of $111 per barrel in March to $109 per barrel at the o
D
end of this year before declining to just over $100 per barrel at the end of 2014, a bit
below the level projected in the March Tealbook.
Nonfuel commodity prices have generally edged down since the March Tealbook.
As with oil, the lower prices likely reflect increased concern regarding global growth
prospects and, in particular, rising concern about the strength of Chinese demand. An
exception has been soybeans, for which prices continue to be boosted by concerns about
growing conditions in South America. We project that nonfuel commodity prices will
remain about flat over the remainder of the projection period, a forecast in line with
quotes from futures markets.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
We now estimate that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the
first quarter of this year, ¾ percentage point above our previous projection. The upward
revision to output growth mostly reflects a combination of larger-than-expected increases
in consumer outlays in the first quarter and a higher level of government purchases than
we had forecast previously; inventory investment has also surprised us thus far this year
by running at about the same robust pace as late last year. In addition, the February and
March readings on the labor market, taken together, were a little better than our
projection in the March Tealbook. When putting together our projection for the second
quarter, we balanced the favorable developments in the first quarter against the
implications for household spending of weaker-than-expected personal income, the
likelihood that the contributions to growth from both government spending and
inventories will prove transitory, and some recent softening in regional and national

time of the March Tealbook.

The Labor Market e
D
n
The labor market continues to improve. Although private payroll employment o
c
rose only 120,000 in March, that increase followed gains averaging 250,000 in the E
c
i
preceding three months. Part of the step-down in March may represent a waning lift to s t
e
m
employment provided by unseasonably warm weather in recent months, and part may
o
D
reflect seasonal adjustment problems tied to the fact that the steepest part of the collapse
in payrolls during the recent recession occurred during the winter months. We think that
the underlying pace of employment growth over the past few months—after adjusting for
weather and seasonal effects—was probably something closer to 200,000 per month.
The unemployment rate edged down in March to 8.2 percent, extending its
decline since August. Meanwhile, other indicators of labor market activity have either
held steady or improved since the March Tealbook: Initial claims for unemployment
insurance have changed little, on balance, in recent weeks after falling for several
months, the improvements seen earlier this year in consumer expectations for
employment and unemployment have been maintained, and measures of job openings
have increased in recent months.
During the second quarter, we expect private payroll employment to increase
175,000 per month, roughly in line with the modest pace of increase in real activity and
the same as in the March Tealbook. We have taken on board the improvement in the
unemployment rate in recent months, and we expect the jobless rate to hold steady at
8.2 percent throughout the second quarter.
The Industrial Sector
Activity in the industrial sector posted a robust gain in the first quarter. Total
industrial production is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 5½ percent, as
weather-induced declines in the output of mines and utilities were more than offset by an
acceleration in manufacturing output to an annual rate of more than 10 percent.3 In the
motor vehicle sector, light vehicle assemblies jumped nearly 900,000 units to an annual
3 On March 30, the Federal Reserve published its annual revision of industrial production and
capacity utilization. In the aggregate, the contour of industrial production was little changed from its
previous estimate and recent utilization rates were little revised.

rate of 9.8 million units in the first quarter and are scheduled to rise further to a u t
O
10.2 million unit pace in the second quarter. Elsewhere in manufacturing, production
&
gains have been widespread across industries. Looking ahead, national and regional e l
v
e
manufacturing surveys point to continued gains in factory production, but at a more D

moderate pace than in the first quarter. All told, we expect growth in manufacturing o

output to slow to a 4 percent pace in the current quarter. For the first half of 2012 as a

D
Household Spending
We now estimate that real PCE rose at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first
quarter, a full percentage point faster than in the March projection. This upward revision
aligns real consumer spending more closely with the strong rise in equity prices and the
gradual improvement in sentiment that we have seen since last fall. With the exception
of energy services, where unseasonably warm weather has held down outlays, spending
increases have been widespread. However, because the stronger incoming data on
spending in the first quarter were accompanied by weaker-than-expected news about
personal income, we have made very little further adjustment to our projection of real
PCE in the near term. As in our previous projection, we expect real PCE to increase at an
annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter.
Although the recent data on housing activity have been a little stronger than we
had expected, we suspect that much of the upside surprise reflects the unusually warm
winter. Single-family housing starts topped 500,000 units at an annual rate in December
and January, but starts then fell back to a pace of about 460,000 units in February and
March. By contrast, permits—which provide a better gauge of the underlying pace of
new construction and, in particular, are less sensitive to weather anomalies—have
increased more gradually over the past year. Meanwhile, housing demand appears to be
improving slowly from very depressed levels: Existing home sales have continued to
edge up in recent months, and house prices have firmed. Still, much of the purchase
demand that does exist continues to be channeled to the still-abundant stock of relatively
inexpensive vacant houses, thereby limiting demand for new homes. As a result, we
expect single-family starts to average about 470,000 units in the coming months, the
same as in the March Tealbook and up just a little from the level of starts that prevailed
before the onset of unseasonably warm weather in December. In the multifamily sector,
starts have trended up over the past year or so from very low levels in response to rising

The growth of real spending on equipment and software (E&S) is estimated to E

have slowed to an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, but we expect outlays to s t
e
m
rise more rapidly in the current quarter. Weighting the series for different equipment
o
D
types by their importance in business investment, orders for nondefense capital goods
rose more than 4 percent over the past three months (not at an annual rate). In addition, a
number of other forward-looking indicators of business outlays, including surveys of
capital spending plans and analysts’ earnings expectations for companies that produce
capital goods, now stand at levels consistent with some acceleration. In light of these
indicators, we project that real E&S will increase at an annual rate of 8½ percent in the
current quarter.
After showing surprising strength through much of 2011, outlays on
nonresidential construction have softened noticeably in recent months, leading us to
project that real investment in nonresidential structures (excluding drilling and mining)
will decline at an annual rate of about 3½ percent over the first half of this year. The
deceleration is in line with the sector’s fundamentals. Although there are hints that
commercial real estate financing conditions have begun to ease somewhat, high vacancy
rates and low sales prices continue to put downward pressure on building activity. After
brisk increases in each of the past two years, investment in the drilling and mining sector
is expected to rise at a more moderate pace in the first half of this year. The high price of
oil should continue to spur investment in this sector, while low natural gas prices have
caused the number of natural gas rigs in operation to fall off noticeably in recent months.
Since rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter, real nonfarm inventories appear to
have increased at roughly the same pace in the first quarter. The staff’s flow-of-goods
system, as well as private surveys of inventory satisfaction and plans, suggest that
inventories (excluding motor vehicles) are generally well aligned with sales, and book-
value inventory-to-sales ratios remain near pre-recession norms. But with producers
anticipated to remain vigilant against the possibility of unwanted accumulations, we
expect stockbuilding outside of motor vehicles to proceed at a slightly slower pace in the
current quarter. In contrast, motor vehicle stocks remain relatively lean, and the step-up

s t Real federal purchases fell at an annual rate of 7 percent in the fourth quarter, led

m
by a drop in defense outlays, and we had expected another decline—albeit at a slower
o
D
rate—in the first quarter. However, spending data available through March suggest that
total real federal expenditures actually edged up last quarter. In the current quarter, we
expect real federal purchases to fall back toward a level more consistent with budget
appropriations. In the state and local sector, the incoming information suggests that real
purchases by these governments may be finally bottoming out: State and local
employment edged up in the first quarter for the first time since 2008, while their real
construction spending declined only slightly. All told, real state and local purchases are
projected to be essentially flat in the coming months.
Foreign Trade
Real exports of goods and services are expected to increase at an average annual
rate of about 6 percent in the first half of 2012, buoyed by robust growth in the emerging
market economies. This projection is a little lower than in the March Tealbook on
account of weaker-than-expected trade data for January and February. Imports are
projected to rise at a 3¾ percent pace in the first half of the year, about ¾ percentage
point faster than we had expected in the previous Tealbook, largely reflecting the
surprising strength of January imports. Overall, net exports are expected to add a little
less than ¼ percentage point to GDP growth in the first half, about ¼ percentage point
lower than in the March Tealbook.
Prices and Wages
We now project that PCE prices increased at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the
first quarter—nearly ½ percentage point faster than expected in the March Tealbook—
with the upward revision mostly attributable to higher-than-expected core PCE inflation.
As for the second quarter, the latest readings on crude oil and gasoline point to a large
deceleration in consumer energy prices, which has led us to lower our second-quarter
estimate for overall inflation to just over 1½ percent. On balance, PCE inflation is little
changed in the first half of this year relative to our previous projection.

o
l
Core PCE prices were revised up noticeably in January and are estimated to have u t
O
increased slightly faster in February and March than we had assumed in the March
&
Tealbook; as a result, core inflation is now projected at 2.2 percent in the first quarter, e l
v
e
nearly ½ percentage point above our previous estimate. Roughly half of the first-quarter D
n
surprise was due to an upward revision to nonmarket prices; historically, price inflation in o
c
E
this category has displayed little persistence. Changes in market-based prices were also
c
i
t
slightly larger than expected in the first quarter, primarily reflecting revisions to the s
e
m
January data on medical services prices; however, the latest information suggests that o
D
market-based inflation over the remainder of the quarter remained fairly close to our
expectation in the March Tealbook. As a result, we now estimate that core PCE inflation
will run at a 1.8 percent pace in the second quarter, only a tenth higher than our previous
projection.
The only new data on labor compensation since the previous Tealbook were the
readings on average hourly earnings in February and March, which were in line with our
expectations. Consequently, we continue to expect that the increase in the Productivity
and Costs measure of nonfarm hourly compensation will average an annual rate of about
2¼ percent in the first half of 2012, the same as in the March Tealbook.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
The broad contour of the medium-term projection is the same as in the March
Tealbook. In particular, we continue to project an acceleration in real GDP over the
forecast period, with the recovery supported by favorable financial conditions, improving
credit availability, and rising confidence in the durability of the expansion. That said, we
continue to anticipate the pickup in aggregate demand to be relatively mild by historical
standards because of a number of important headwinds, including ongoing concerns
about the European situation, a slow pace of improvement in the housing market, and a
restrictive stance of fiscal policy. Indeed, even assuming that the 2001–03 tax cuts and
most other expiring tax provisions are extended beyond the end of this year, total fiscal
policy is expected to directly restrain real GDP growth by ¼ percentage point this year
and a full percentage point in 2013 before easing back to about ¼ percentage point in
2014. As a result, real GDP is projected to increase at an annual rate of 2¾ percent over
the second half of 2012 and in 2013 before picking up to 3¼ percent in 2014.
Part of the fiscal restraint in our forecast is reflected in falling government
purchases. In particular, real federal expenditures are projected to decline 1¾ percent this

year and then to fall more than 4 percent in both 2013 and 2014, owing to the effects of u t
O
the Budget Control Act and the drawdown of overseas military operations. We expect
&
real purchases by state and local governments to pick up only very slowly over the e l
v
e
medium term, reflecting sluggish growth in their tax revenues. D
n
o
c
The large fiscal drag we expect next year shows through especially to our forecast E
c
i
for consumer spending. In particular, the anticipated expiration of the payroll tax cut and t
s
e
m
EUC program at the end of 2012 imparts significant restraint on the growth of real
o
D
disposal personal income, offsetting some of the positive impetus from an improving
labor market, rising confidence, and increases in household wealth. As a result, we
project that real PCE will rise 2¾ percent in both 2012 and 2013 before picking up to
3¼ percent in 2014. The figures for 2012 and 2013 are about ¼ percentage point higher
than in the March forecast, reflecting upward revisions to household wealth associated
with the higher projected paths for equity and home prices.
As in previous Tealbooks, we expect a very slow recovery in housing
construction over the medium term. Despite some encouraging signals from home sales
and house prices, the underlying level of activity in this sector remains deeply depressed,
and exceedingly tight mortgage credit appears likely to weigh on the demand for housing
for some time. Moreover, the stock of vacant houses is still sizable, and we expect that
the flow of homes from foreclosure into the resale market will remain substantial,
although it should diminish over time. Accordingly, our projection calls for single-family
housing starts to rise only gradually next year—reaching an annual rate of 580,000 units
by the end of 2013—and then to pick up at a slightly faster pace in 2014 as uncertainty
and pessimism about the housing market dissipates further.
In the business sector, we continue to expect that expenditures on E&S will rise
modestly over the medium term. Although firms have ample cash, many likely see little
reason to expand capacity aggressively in an environment of relatively sluggish demand
for their products. We project real E&S outlays to rise at an annual rate of roughly
6 percent in the second half of 2012 and in 2013 and just slightly faster than that in 2014.
Consequently, we expect a relatively slow expansion in the capital stock. (The box
“Equipment and Software Spending during the Recovery” provides additional
background on the E&S projection.)
Our outlook continues to anticipate a sluggish pace of investment in
nonresidential structures. Reflecting the weak fundamentals cited earlier, structures

Equipment and Software Spending during the Recovery
&
l
e
v
e After declining dramatically during the recession, real spending on equipment and
D
software (E&S) rose rapidly early in the recovery. From mid‐2009 through the end of
n
o 2010, real E&S spending (the black line in the figure below) grew at an average annual
c
E rate of nearly 15 percent—noticeably more steeply than during the average postwar
c
i recovery (the red line), despite the relatively modest rate of recovery in overall activity.1
t
s
e In 2011, the rate of increase in E&S investment slowed to 9 percent but remained solid.
m
o With these increases, the level of E&S investment regained its pre‐recession peak late last
D
year. In this regard, E&S contrasts sharply with both residential and nonresidential
structures investment (not shown), which also experienced deep declines during the
recession but have yet to recover appreciably.
Of course, E&S spending normally rebounds rapidly following a downturn as firms
respond to improvements in sales prospects and the relatively low costs of borrowing
that typify the onset of recovery. Indeed, as shown by the red line in the figure on the
next page, one of our standard models based on business output growth and the cost of
capital would have predicted a fairly swift turnaround in investment growth, despite the
modest recovery in output.
1
Note, however, that low levels of investment during the recession and early recovery combined
with historically high rates of depreciation to produce unusually weak growth in the E&S capital stock,
which is more in keeping with the modest pace of recovery in overall activity. As a result, the level of the
E&S capital stock remains well below its historical trend.

u
However, the growth rate of actual spending (the black line) significantly outpaced the O
model prediction. We have interpreted this surprising strength largely as the release of &
l
pent‐up demand that had built up during the crisis and recession as credit supply e
v
e
restrictions and extraordinary uncertainty caused firms to defer many investment D
projects. Indeed, some alternative models that explicitly incorporate the low level of the n
o
capital stock, which may proxy for pent‐up demand, predicted a stronger rebound than c
E
our standard models. However, we have had little success in quantifying the magnitude c
i
t
of this pent‐up demand with much precision, and the atypically brisk recovery in E&S s
e
spending might also have been driven by other factors. m
o
D
Over the medium‐term forecast horizon, we expect only moderate increases in E&S
spending, as sluggish sales growth provides limited motivation for firms to expand
capacity. Although we expect the impetus to spending from pent‐up demand or other
factors to persist, we project that it will wane in magnitude in the coming years.
Reflecting this view, our forecast for E&S growth is somewhat above the predictions of
the model throughout the forecast period, but the size of this residual diminishes over
time (see the figure below). All told, we expect E&S outlays, which contributed about
1 percentage point and ¾ percentage point to GDP growth in 2010 and 2011, respectively,
to contribute only about ½ percentage point in each year from 2012 to 2014.
The spending data that we have received in recent months are consistent with our
projection for a moderation in the rate of increase in capital expenditures this year.
However, considerable uncertainty attends our forecast. Given our limited
understanding of the factors that have driven spending above our model’s prediction,
our forecast for their persistence is largely judgmental. Thus, there are ample risks to the
forecast on both the upside and the downside.

activity, as Europe slowly emerges from its recession. Meanwhile, real imports are
projected to rise at about a 4½ percent rate on average through 2014, supported by the
growth of U.S. demand but tempered by dollar depreciation. On net, trade is expected to
make an essentially zero arithmetic contribution to real GDP growth in 2012 and in the
subsequent two years.
AGGREGATE SUPPLY, THE LABOR MARKET, AND INFLATION
Potential GDP and the NAIRU
We made only small changes to our supply-side assumptions this round. The
more substantial revisions we made last round were designed to bring the output and
unemployment gaps into closer alignment with our understanding of the dynamics of
employment during the recession. Even so, the first-quarter decline in the unemployment
rate was somewhat larger than could be explained by our estimate of near-term output
growth, leading us to make a small further downward adjustment to the past and
projected level of potential output in this forecast. We continue to assume that potential
output growth will edge up from about 2 percent in 2012 to 2¼ percent in 2014,
reflecting the projected increase in capital accumulation. In addition, we assume the
NAIRU will remain at 6 percent through 2014, the same as in the March Tealbook.4 (A
longer perspective on staff estimates of economic capacity is provided in the box
“Revisions to Measures of Economic Capacity.”)
Productivity and the Labor Market
Given the available data on hours worked and our estimate of real GDP growth,
we now judge that labor productivity edged down in the first quarter, bringing the level of
productivity close to our estimate of its trend. Over the remainder of the medium term,
4 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency
benefits on the unemployment rate, is 6.3 percent in 2012:Q1. As before, we expect the gap between the
NAIRU and the effective NAIRU to close by the middle of 2013.

Revisions to Measures of Economic Capacity
&
l
e
v
e The slow pace of the recovery raises the question of whether a significant
D
portion of the output loss inflicted by the recession and financial crisis is
n
o permanent. Although we believe that the amount of economic slack has been
c
E and remains substantial, we have also marked down considerably our
c
i assessment of the capacity of the economy compared with our projection in
t
s
e January 2008.1
m
o
D
One way to measure economic capacity is in the labor market. As shown in the
figure below, our current assumption (which we have held since late 2010) is that
the NAIRU (the solid red line) increased from 5 percent to 6 percent over 2008
and 2009, on the view that the mismatch between available jobs and
unemployed workers likely rose during the recession. Over time, we expect the
NAIRU to retrace most of that increase and to fall to 5¼ percent by late 2017, as a
strengthening labor market encourages workers and firms to make adjustments
to improve matching and as some unemployed individuals permanently exit the
labor force. That ultimate figure of 5¼ percent is ½ percentage point higher than
we had assumed in 2008 (the dashed red line), partly reflecting permanent labor
market scarring associated with the extraordinarily high level of long‐term
unemployment.
1 This analysis uses the January 2008 Greenbook as the point of comparison because it
was the first to include a long‐run forecast. Although that projection reflected the incipient
economic weakness, the staff did not forecast a recession and had not marked down potential
GDP. The long‐run forecast presented in the January 2008 Tealbook ended in 2012; however,
the staff created a projection beyond 2012 for use in the optimal‐control exercises reported in
the Bluebook. For this analysis, the January 2008 assumptions for the NAIRU, potential GDP,
and structural labor productivity beyond 2012 are taken from this longer‐run projection.

Additionally, we have lowered our assumption about the trend labor force, O
reflecting a net downward revision to the working‐age population in recent years &
l
and surprisingly weak readings on the labor force participation rate (LFPR). e
v
e
Although we think much of the decline in the LFPR reflects cyclical and other D
factors, we also view it as suggesting that the downtrend in participation has n
o
been somewhat steeper than we had previously assumed and so marked down c
E
our trend participation rate a bit beginning in 2009 in response (not shown). c
i
t
s
e
Another way to measure economic capacity is potential GDP, shown by the red m
o
lines in the lower‐left figure. We now estimate that the level of potential GDP at D
the end of 2011 was nearly 4 percent lower than in our January 2008 projection.
By way of comparison, the actual level of GDP at the end of 2011 came in about
8 percent lower than our 2008 forecast.
A decomposition of potential GDP can help provide insight about the sources of
the revision. In the staff’s accounting, potential GDP comprises trend labor input
and structural labor productivity. Much of the downward revision to our
estimate of potential GDP through 2011 reflects lower trend labor input—in
particular, the revisions to our assumptions about the NAIRU and the trend labor
force discussed earlier. In addition, we revised down our estimate of structural
productivity growth, shown in the lower‐right figure. Some of the downward
revision to structural productivity growth since the onset of the recession comes
from a smaller contribution from capital input during and after the recession.
The remainder reflects a lower estimate of the growth rate of structural
multifactor productivity, the part of productivity not attributed to other inputs.

implying a rate of actual productivity growth that is similar to its trend growth rate.

We expect the pace of private employment growth to hold fairly steady, with e
D
private job gains averaging nearly 200,000 per month through 2013—little changed from n
o
c
our March forecast—and continuing at a similar pace throughout 2014. In the E
c
i
government sector, we expect state and local employment to change little this year and t
s
e
m
then to rise modestly over the next two years as budget pressures ease somewhat. All
o
D
told, these employment gains push the unemployment rate down to about 7¾ percent by
the end of 2013 and to just below 7½ percent by the end of 2014; throughout the next
three years, the projected path of the unemployment rate is slightly lower than our
forecast in the March Tealbook, reflecting its lower starting point.
Resource Utilization
Our estimates of economic slack in this projection are a little narrower than those
in the March Tealbook. Nevertheless, economic slack is expected to remain sizable over
the medium term, with the unemployment rate at the end of 2014 projected to be
1½ percentage points above the NAIRU and the output gap to be 2¾ percent.
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly reflects trends in the
labor force, our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of
plants to produce with the equipment that is in place and ready to operate; it does not take
account of the potential workforce, either inside the industrial sector or outside of it.
Given these differences, we expect capacity utilization in the industrial sector to continue
to be taken up more quickly than is reflected in the GDP gap, both because
manufacturing output growth is anticipated to exceed real GDP growth over the forecast
period and because manufacturing capacity is projected to rise less rapidly than potential
GDP over the next two years. In 2014, potential GDP and manufacturing capacity are
projected to increase at about the same rate. As a result, our projection calls for the
factory operating rate to rise to its long-run average in the second half of this year and
then to move above it over the next two years despite a still-sizable GDP gap.
Prices and Compensation
We continue to expect that the wide margin of slack in the labor market and low
rates of price inflation will restrain the increase in labor costs over the medium term.

O
2012 and 2013—a touch more than we projected in our March forecast—and around
&
3 percent in 2014. This small upward revision mainly reflects the slightly lower path of e l
v

with our projection for moderate productivity gains over the medium term, imply only a o

Prices of imported core goods were little changed in the first quarter, held down
o
D
by the lagged effects of the steep decline in nonfuel commodity prices that occurred late
last year. Core import price inflation is expected to pick up to about 1½ percent by the
end of 2012 and then persist at that rate through 2014, consistent with the projected pace
of foreign CPI inflation, moderate dollar depreciation, and the flattening out of
commodity prices. Relative to the March Tealbook, stronger-than-expected import price
data for March led us to revise up slightly our forecast for core import price inflation in
the first half of this year, but our projection is essentially unchanged over the medium
term.
Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on net, since
the time of the March Tealbook. Median 5-to-10-year expected inflation from the
Michigan survey ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 3 percent in March and remained at
that rate in the preliminary April release.5 Meanwhile, the TIPS-based measure of the
five-year forward rate of inflation compensation has increased about ¼ percentage point
since the March Tealbook, but we estimate that only a relatively small portion of that
increase reflects higher inflation expectations.
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that the projected low level of resource
utilization will help to hold the average pace of inflation below the Committee’s
objective. However, in light of the narrower margin of slack in this forecast and higher
readings on inflation early this year (even leaving aside the noisy nonmarket data), we
have nudged up our forecast for core consumer price inflation over the medium term. We
now project that core PCE prices will increase 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent in
both 2013 and 2014, up 0.1 percentage point in each year relative to the March Tealbook.
Increases in energy prices are projected to push total PCE inflation slightly above the
core rate of inflation this year, but with energy prices expected to decline over the next
5 The average differential between longer-term Michigan inflation expectations and core PCE
inflation over the past decade is about 1 percentage point.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
D
e
n
o
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and c
E
our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors. c
i
t
s
e
The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key assumptions: m
o
D
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent, consistent with
the Committee’s statement after the January meeting on its longer-run goals
and monetary policy strategies. The federal funds rate continues to be set
according to the estimated outcome-based rule.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates over the 2014–17 period, but as the
System’s portfolio holdings normalize, this downward pressure wanes and
thereby contributes somewhat to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield.
Beyond 2017, the System’s asset holdings are expected to have little influence
on the level of term premiums.
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal
levels, and banks further ease their lending standards.
 The federal government budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) narrows
from around 4 percent of GDP in 2014 to about 3¼ percent of GDP in 2017,
primarily reflecting the effects of the recovery on tax receipts and the
budgetary restraint imposed by the Budget Control Act. Thereafter, the deficit
widens because of fast-rising transfer payments, mostly for programs related
to health care.
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2 percent per year
from 2014 to 2017. The pace of dollar depreciation tapers off thereafter. The
price of crude oil edges down about $2 per year from 2014 to 2016 and
remains flat in real terms thereafter. Foreign real GDP rises at an average
annual rate of 3¼ percent in 2015 through 2017 and then gradually edges
down to a 3 percent pace by late in the decade.

below 2 percent in 2017. Late in the decade, the economy settles down at an
unemployment rate near 5¼ percent (the assumed long-run NAIRU), with inflation at
2 percent (the Committee’s objective) and a nominal funds rate close to 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign economic activity expanded at an estimated 3¼ percent pace in the first
quarter, up from the 1¼ percent rate recorded for the final quarter of 2011. As expected,
the factors that suppressed output growth late last year, most notably the supply chain
disruptions brought on by the floods in Thailand, proved temporary. In fact, because
recent indicators, particularly in the emerging market economies, came in a little stronger
than we had anticipated, our first-quarter estimate of foreign GDP growth is a touch
higher than in the March Tealbook.
k
o
o
l
t
In contrast to the somewhat improved indicators for global activity, financial u
O
conditions in Europe have backtracked of late, with markets becoming concerned once &
l
again about developments in Spain and Italy. (See the box “Continuing Vulnerabilities in e
v
e
the Euro Area” for further details.) So far, the recent increase in tensions remains D
n
broadly consistent with our baseline view that Europe will muddle through its crisis but o
c
E
face periodic setbacks along the way. Continued financial stress and fiscal austerity l
’
t
n
should keep the euro area in recession throughout 2012 and hold down growth to a I
subpar pace into 2014. The risk remains, of course, that financial strains in Europe will
snowball into a more severe crisis, a scenario that we explore in the Risks and
Uncertainty section.
Assuming that this risk does not materialize, we project that real GDP growth in
the foreign economies should average about 2¾ percent during the remainder of this year
before picking up to 3½ percent by 2014. Growth strengthens as monetary policy
remains generally accommodative, the U.S. recovery solidifies, and conditions in the
euro area improve. Our outlook is little changed from the March Tealbook.
Readings on foreign inflation came back down in the first quarter, to below
2½ percent from around 3 percent in the second half of 2011. With oil and other
commodity prices largely quiescent since the March Tealbook and projected to remain so
over the forecast period, we expect inflation to stay near 2½ percent through 2014. Our
forecast envisions some further monetary policy easing this year in Japan and the United
Kingdom. However, as growth improves and output gaps narrow, we expect that central
banks will begin withdrawing accommodative measures in 2014.

Continuing Vulnerabilities in the Euro Area
The normalization of financial conditions in the euro area appears to have stalled
since the time of the March Tealbook. Most strikingly, market concerns about
Italy and Spain have intensified, as shown by a renewed rise in their sovereign
bond spreads (see lower‐left figure on next page). Additionally, euro‐area bank
stock prices have fallen, and bank CDS spreads have generally risen, with the
greatest increase in Spain. This turnaround in financial conditions partly reflects
the fact that, despite significant progress, financial backstops for vulnerable
euro‐area governments remain inadequate. With their fundamental fiscal and
competitiveness problems still unresolved, this situation leaves euro‐area
k
o countries—most notably Italy and Spain—susceptible to shifts in market
o
l sentiment.
t
u
O
Italy’s vulnerability to such changes in sentiment stems primarily from the
&
country’s weak economic growth prospects and high debt‐to‐GDP ratio (see
l
e
v lower‐right figure on next page). Political challenges to addressing these
e
D problems are significant, and further setbacks over the intermeeting period in
n the approval of a major labor market reform have revived doubts about the
o
c ability of the technocratic government to implement structural reforms.
E
l
’
t
n For Spain, three factors appear to be behind the resurgence of market pressure,
I
which has sent Spanish 10‐year bond yields above Italian yields for the first time
since last summer. First, economic activity has continued to be very weak, with
GDP contracting at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter and the
unemployment rate soaring to nearly 24 percent in February, about three times
its level before the global financial crisis. We expect GDP in Spain to contract
2¼ percent (from fourth quarter to fourth quarter) in 2012 and to stagnate in
2013. In principle, growth could be revived through structural reforms and
resulting improvements in competitiveness, but reforms are progressing only
slowly and, in any case, their effect on competitiveness is not likely to take hold
quickly.
Second, Spain’s fiscal performance has been disappointing. The 2011 budget
deficit was recently announced to be 8.5 percent of GDP, significantly above the
target of 6 percent. In addition, after somewhat messy renegotiations with
European authorities, the country’s deficit target for 2012 was revised up to
5.3 percent from 4.4 percent. The 2013 deficit target remains unchanged at
3 percent of GDP. Both of those targets will prove challenging to achieve.
Spain’s fiscal difficulties in 2011 were due to stagnant economic output and tax
revenues as well as to poor budget performance among regional and local
governments, which have considerable budget autonomy in Spain.1 Further,
largely due to recognition of regional and local government arrears, the Spanish
government recently announced that it expected public debt to increase to
1
On April 12, parliament passed the Budget Stability Law, intended to roughly replicate
the European Fiscal Compact at the national level and thereby gain control of regional
budgets, but it remains to be seen how effective the law will be.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) April 18, 2012
80 percent of GDP in 2012, about 6 percentage points more than previously
anticipated. This revision still leaves the debt‐to‐GDP ratio of Spain well below
that of Italy’s but suggests the potential for rapid increases in debt.
Third, markets worry that public debt could be significantly boosted by further
bank bailouts, importantly related to the on‐going bust in the property market.
Housing sales have remained severely depressed, and house prices in March
were down 11.5 percent over the previous 12 months and almost 30 percent
below their peak in December 2007. About 8 percent of loans at Spanish banks
are nonperforming, the majority of which are related to construction and real
estate. In early February, the Spanish government gave banks until the end of
2012 to increase loan loss provisions and capital buffers by up to €50 billion. This
increase appears likely to cover embedded losses in the system, though a few
k
individual banks, especially those already in receivership, might require more o
o
public assistance this year. Additional provisioning will likely be necessary in 2013 l
t
u
and 2014 as real estate values decline further and unemployment remains high. O
Although Spanish authorities hope banks will be able to handle such provisions &
through earnings retention, capital raising, and mergers, significant additional l
e
public capital injections may be necessary if the severity of macroeconomic stress v
e
worsens. D
n
o
As indicated in the lower‐right figure, even under the staff’s somewhat c
E
pessimistic assumptions for GDP growth and fiscal performance, Spain’s debt‐to‐ l
’
t
GDP path is relatively favorable. Even so, a deeper recession and greater n
I
deterioration of banking conditions than we currently anticipate would have the
potential to burden the government’s balance sheet with significant additional
debt, further weakening prospects for fiscal stabilization. Markets are clearly
focused on these downside risks at present.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
Our forecast of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) is
broadly unchanged from the March Tealbook. After stalling in the fourth quarter, AFE
GDP is expected to grow at a 1¼ percent pace in 2012. We continue to project a mild
contraction of the euro-area economy this year, with a more severe downturn in the
peripheral European countries, where financial stresses and fiscal consolidation are very
pronounced. Amid an eventual easing of these financial stresses and some strengthening
of demand from the United States, we project that GDP growth in the AFEs will rise to
1¾ percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in 2014.
k
o
o
t l Recent inflation data in the AFEs are also broadly in line with our March
u
O
Tealbook projections. We estimate that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of
&
l 2 percent in the first quarter of 2012. As the effect of the earlier rise in oil prices
e
v
e dissipates, we project that inflation will moderate to 1½ percent in the second quarter and
D
n remain at about that pace through 2014. Contained inflation and persistent economic
o
c
E slack should allow the major foreign central banks to maintain stimulative monetary
l
’
t
n policy at least until 2014.
I
Euro Area
Recent data are in line with our forecast of a mild contraction of economic
activity. The euro-area composite PMI for the first quarter moved up off its fourth-
quarter low but remained under 50. Industrial production over the first two months of the
year fell below the fourth-quarter average. Labor market conditions deteriorated further,
as the unemployment rate reached 10.8 percent in February, its highest level since 1997.
Consumption indicators were mixed through March.
European policymakers made some progress in surmounting the hurdles
associated with the debt crisis. The Greek government successfully concluded a debt
exchange of privately held domestic bonds. And European authorities, in conjunction
with the IMF, approved a second rescue package for Greece that secures additional
financing through the end of 2014. European policymakers also agreed to increase the
combined lending capacity of their rescue facilities from €500 billion to €700 billion, of
which €500 billion remains uncommitted. However, this action fell short of calls to raise
the lending capacity to over €900 billion and could prove insufficient to backstop
vulnerable euro-area economies.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) April 18, 2012
After having improved significantly earlier this year, financial conditions
worsened more recently as incoming data continued to point to declining euro-area output
and as fiscal and political developments in Spain and Italy were disappointing. Sovereign
bond spreads are up in many countries in the region, and stock prices are down,
especially for banks. (One manifestation of the financial pressures weighing on several
peripheral economies is discussed in the box “Euro-Area TARGET2 Balances.”) In the
March Tealbook, we had already anticipated that financial stresses would only slowly
diminish over the forecast period, with occasional bouts of financial turmoil likely.
Accordingly, in our current projection, we marked down the euro-area forecast only
¼ percentage point in 2012 and a touch in early 2013. We still expect GDP to contract
k
o
through the end of this year and to expand a meager 1 percent in 2013 before accelerating o
l
t
u
to a 2 percent pace by the end of 2014. This recovery is anticipated to be weak, as tight O
fiscal and financial conditions weigh considerably on economic activity. &
l
e
v
e
Euro-area inflation stepped down to a 2.5 percent pace in the first quarter from D
n
3.8 percent in the fourth. With considerable resource slack and moderating energy prices, o
c
E
we expect inflation to fall further to around 1¾ percent in 2012 before settling at
l
’
t
n
1½ percent in 2013 and 2014. The European Central Bank (ECB) left policy rates I
unchanged at its past two meetings. We expect the ECB to keep its benchmark policy
rate at 1 percent over the forecast period and to continue to provide significant liquidity
support to banks. If pressures in sovereign bond markets become great enough, the ECB
may resume purchases of peripheral sovereign bonds under its Securities Markets
Programme.
United Kingdom
Recent data, including strong readings on services and construction PMIs, led us
to revise up somewhat our estimate for GDP growth in the first half of this year, to
1¼ percent, following a 1.2 percent contraction in the fourth quarter. We expect growth
to stay at that pace in the second half of this year but to rise to 2¾ percent in 2014.
However, this growth is insufficient to substantially narrow the output gap. The
U.K. government’s deficit reduction plans, which were reaffirmed in the 2012 budget, are
expected to shave nearly 1 percentage point from GDP growth over the forecast period.
We expect inflation to move down to 2¼ percent in 2012 from a rate of nearly
5 percent in the previous year. That said, we marked up our inflation forecast nearly
½ percentage point in 2012 because of surprisingly high March inflation and the

Euro-Area TARGET2 Balances
The extent to which the ECB should continue to provide funding to troubled
euro-area banks—and at what terms—has become a source of considerable
debate among the various euro-area national central banks (NCBs).1 The recent
sharp rise in TARGET2 balances has provided a focal point for this debate.2
The TARGET2 system settles domestic and cross-border interbank payments in
the euro area by crediting and debiting banks’ reserve accounts at their
respective NCBs. For example, if an Italian resident requests that its bank make a
payment to a German bank (say to purchase a German product or to open a
k
o German bank account), TARGET2 generates a deposit in the German bank’s
o
l account at the Bundesbank and subtracts a matching amount from the Italian
t
u
bank’s account at the Bank of Italy. At the end of each day, if an NCB has
O
received more payments than it has made, it acquires a TARGET2 claim against
&
l the ECB. If it has made more payments than it has received, it acquires a
e
v TARGET2 liability. These claims and liabilities are the TARGET2 balances in
e
D question.3
n
o
c As shown in the figures on the next page, before the global financial crisis and
E
l subsequent European sovereign debt crisis, TARGET2 claims and liabilities
’
t
n (shown in red) were small. Even though Greece and Spain ran sizable current
I
account deficits, and thus made substantial cross-border payments, private
capital inflows adequately financed these outgoing payments. In early 2008,
however, as banks in both Spain and Greece found it more difficult to obtain
private market funding, they began to rely increasingly on NCB funding (shown in
black). Later, in the summer of 2011, as the euro-area sovereign debt crisis
intensified, lending by the Bank of Italy to Italian banks began to increase rapidly
as well. The NCB lending in these countries helped avoid the potential
disruptions that might have occurred from forced deleveraging by peripheral
banks and fire sales of assets. At the same time, however, the resulting
injections of liquidity into the peripheral banking systems financed payments
outflows, leading to increased TARGET2 liabilities for these countries’ NCBs. As
recipients of payments flows, banks in Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and
Luxembourg greatly reduced their reliance on liquidity drawn from their own
NCBs, and the NCBs in those countries acquired large TARGET2 claims. The
Bundesbank is now the largest creditor, with TARGET2 claims in excess of
€600 billion, about 25 percent of German GDP, and total TARGET2 liabilities have
grown from near zero in 2007 to almost €1 trillion at present.
1
Reflecting such tensions, the Bundesbank and the Austrian National Bank recently
announced that they would stop accepting as collateral bank debt guaranteed by countries
with EU support programs.
2
TARGET2 is an acronym for Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement
Express Transfer. Like the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire, it is a real-time gross settlement system
settled in central bank money.
3
Some features of the TARGET2 balances are analogous to those of the Federal Reserve’s
interdistrict settlement balances.

Do TARGET2 balances pose risks to the Eurosystem? Some observers argue that
large TARGET2 claims will hinder liquidity provision by the respective NCBs, but
no such limit on NCB lending exists. Additionally, some fear that the risks
associated with Eurosystem lending may fall disproportionately to those
countries with large TARGET2 claims. So long as the Eurosystem remains intact,
however, these fears are unfounded. According to Eurosystem rules, capital
losses are allocated according to the respective capital shares of the NCBs in the
Eurosystem, not according to TARGET2 balances. Nonetheless, creditor nations
may worry about the value of their TARGET2 claims in the event of a messy
dissolution of the euro area, as there are no agreements among member
countries on how to share losses if a country were to leave the euro area or the
union were to be entirely dissolved.
k
The legitimacy of these worries is difficult to assess, but concerns about the o
o
TARGET2 balances have prompted some German politicians to call for caps on l
t
u
these balances. Although the Eurosystem is politically insulated by design, O
political pressure could lead to implicit constraints on the conduct of monetary &
policy, potentially lessening the ECB’s effectiveness. Should political pressure l
e
ultimately result in explicit controls on cross-border payments, the viability of the v
e
monetary union itself would be in doubt. Even though these dire scenarios may D
well be avoided, the recent expansion of TARGET2 balances is an indicator that n
o
the fundamental causes of the strains in the euro area have yet to be resolved. c

announcement of supplementary tax measures in the recent budget. Inflation then
moderates further to 1¾ percent in 2013 and 2014. We continue to project that the Bank
of England (BOE) will increase the scale of its asset purchase program by £50 billion.
However, with economic indicators a bit stronger and our outlook for inflation slightly
higher, we now expect that the BOE will not resume purchases until the second half of
this year when the BOE can be more certain that inflation pressures are subsiding. The
current program is scheduled to be completed this month, bringing the overall size of the
program to £325 billion (22 percent of GDP).
Japan
k
o
o Following a contraction of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, we estimate that
l
t
u
O Japanese real GDP rebounded 2¾ percent in the first quarter, fueled by the recovery of
& key parts suppliers in Thailand, car purchase incentives, and a step-up in post-earthquake
l
e
v reconstruction activity. However, some recent indicators suggest the underlying pace of
e
D
growth is weaker. In particular, February exports barely edged up, and the Bank of
n
o
c Japan’s (BOJ) Tankan index—a key indicator of business confidence—failed to improve.
E
’ l Accordingly, we project that real GDP growth will slow to 1½ percent by the end of the
t
n
I year. Growth should remain at that pace in 2013 and 2014, as the effects of a pickup in
global economic output are roughly offset by the completion of reconstruction activity.
Higher-than-expected food and energy prices pushed consumer prices up at an
estimated pace of 1 percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage point more than projected in
the March Tealbook. After declining for the past three years, consumer prices are
expected to remain roughly constant over the forecast period. Inflation will still be well
below the BOJ’s stated medium-term inflation goal of 1 percent. Accordingly, we
anticipate that the BOJ will expand its asset purchase program somewhat further.
Canada
Recent data have been slightly more upbeat than we had expected, leading us to
raise our estimate of first-quarter GDP growth a touch to 2¼ percent. In March, the
manufacturing PMI strengthened and employment posted a substantial gain. We expect
growth to pick up from 2¼ percent this year and next to 3 percent by the end of 2014,
supported by accommodative monetary policy and the projected U.S. recovery. Our
GDP forecast is largely unchanged from the March Tealbook. However, one concern is
that, unlike in most other advanced economies, household debt continues to rise relative
to disposable income, posing some risk of a pullback in housing and consumption.

As the effects of recent increases in the prices of food and energy fade, we expect
inflation to move down from 2½ percent in the first quarter to 2 percent over the rest of
the forecast period. With moderate resource slack and diminishing price pressure, we
continue to assume that the Bank of Canada will keep its target for the overnight rate at
1 percent through 2013 and will tighten starting in early 2014.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
Recent data from the emerging market economies (EMEs) have been reasonably
upbeat. We now estimate that real GDP growth in these countries rebounded to an
annual rate of about 5¼ percent in the first quarter from just 2½ percent in the fourth. k
o
o
The rebound is due importantly to the restoration of supply chains following last year’s l
t
u
O
flooding in Thailand as well as to some recovery of both external and domestic demand.
&
We project that growth will stabilize at a near-trend rate of about 4¾ percent during 2012 l
e
v
and 2013 before rising to 5 percent in 2014. The projection for the first quarter and the e
D
next are revised up a touch, relative to the March Tealbook, in light of stronger-than- n
o
c
expected indicators in much of emerging Asia. E
l
’
t
n
I
Headline inflation in the EMEs moderated to an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the
first quarter. This rate is about 1 percentage point below our March projection, reflecting
the faster-than-expected dissipation of food price pressures, especially in China and
Mexico. We see inflation remaining at 2¾ percent in the second quarter before rising to
3¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.
Most central banks have kept policy rates unchanged since the March Tealbook,
although central banks in Brazil and India eased policy. Capital flows into EME-
dedicated funds slowed in March after an earlier sharp run-up in late January and
February. In response to the earlier increase in flows, the Brazilian government extended
a 6 percent tax, previously applied to external loans and bond issuances with duration of
up to three years, to those of up to five years.
China
Chinese real GDP growth edged down to 7½ percent in the first quarter from a
revised 7¾ percent in the fourth, both figures about ½ percentage point lower than in the
March Tealbook. Investment moderated somewhat, in part reflecting weakness in the
residential property sector. However, consumer demand remained robust, with retail
sales growing around their fourth-quarter pace, and industrial production picked up in

March. The trade surplus widened in the first quarter, as exports rose and imports were
flat. And credit conditions eased, with bank lending moving significantly higher in
March. In view of these supportive indicators, we project that Chinese real GDP growth
will rise to about 8½ percent in the second quarter.
Over the remainder of the forecast period, we continue to expect GDP to expand
at about an 8¼ percent pace. Restrained growth in the advanced economies will keep
external demand on the soft side, leaving the path for Chinese growth a little below our
estimate of potential. This outlook is little changed from the March projection. We still
believe that Chinese authorities have sufficient scope for policy action to avoid a hard
k
o
landing, but a less benign outcome, possibly owing to difficulties in the property and
o
l
t
u banking sectors, remains a risk.
O
&
e l Chinese headline consumer price inflation moved down further in the first quarter,
v
e
D to an annual rate of 1½ percent. The sharp decline in recent quarters—from 6 percent in
n
o the third quarter of last year—is largely a result of food price increases subsiding as
c
E
supply conditions improved. Assuming food prices flatten out as projected, inflation is
l
’
t
n expected to move back up to around 3 percent over the next three years.
I
Other Emerging Asia
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, we estimate that real GDP rebounded at an annual
pace of 6½ percent in the first quarter after being flat in the fourth, as supply chains
disrupted by flooding were largely restored. This increase is about ¾ percentage point
faster than in our March Tealbook forecast. The Thai economy is recovering
considerably more quickly than we had expected from last year’s floods. In addition,
first-quarter indicators of both external and domestic demand in the rest of the region also
surprised on the upside. Industrial production strengthened and exports, especially to the
United States, rose substantially in several economies. PMIs increased further into the
expansion range in March. As the temporary boost from the restoration of supply chains
fades away, we look for growth in the region to step down to around 4½ percent in the
second half of this year before edging up to 5 percent in 2014.
We estimate that quarterly inflation in the region subsided to an annual rate of
about 3 percent in the first quarter, as previous increases in food prices were reversed. As
the trajectory of food prices flattens out, inflation should pick up to about 3¼ percent
over the remainder of the forecast period.

Latin America
We estimate that real GDP growth in Mexico stepped up to 4 percent in the first
quarter from a disappointingly weak pace of 1¾ percent in the fourth. The step-up in
Mexican activity in the first quarter is in line with the sharp jump in U.S. manufacturing
output. Exports improved through February, and the PMI increased in the first quarter.
Looking forward, we see Mexican growth moderating to 3½ percent for the rest of this
year and to 3 percent in 2013 before recovering somewhat in 2014, consistent with the
projected path for the growth of U.S. manufacturing production.
For South America, we estimate economic growth edged up to an annual rate of
k
o
3¾ percent in the first quarter and project it to strengthen slightly further over the forecast o
l
t
period. In Brazil, it appears that real GDP accelerated to a 3¼ percent pace in the first u

dipping down further in the current quarter before settling at about 3½ percent over the
remainder of the forecast period, a bit below the upper bound of the central bank’s target
range.
In Brazil, inflation slowed to an annual rate of 4¼ percent in the first quarter, and
we expect it to ease further to about 4 percent in the current quarter. With economic
growth having stalled in the second half of last year, the central bank has been loosening
policy since August. Most recently, in March, the central bank reduced its policy rate by
75 basis points to 9.75 percent and alluded to the possibility of further cuts. However, we
project that Brazilian inflation will move back up as accommodative monetary policy
supports an improvement in economic growth.

Financial Developments
Broad financial market conditions were little changed, on balance, over the
intermeeting period. Nonetheless, investors’ economic and policy outlooks swung
significantly during the period in response to official statements and incoming economic
data. Early in the period, risk appetite seemed to improve following the March FOMC
statement, the release of the results from the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review (CCAR), and other incoming information pointing to an improved economic
outlook. Later in the period, however, market participants appeared to pull back from
risk amid signs of increasing financial strains in Europe and as some foreign and U.S.
economic data releases came in weaker than expected.
On balance, domestic asset prices were little changed. Policy expectations edged
down, while Treasury yields were about flat. Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices ended
the period at about the same levels as the day before the March FOMC meeting, and
option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose a little, although it remained near the
low end of its recent range. Risk spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little
changed, on net, while spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds ended the period a
bit higher. In contrast, broad indexes of foreign equity prices generally declined and
s
t

yield spreads on Italian and Spanish sovereign debt to German bunds rose considerably. e
m
The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was about p

a
i
c
n
Financing flows for financial and nonfinancial corporations remained solid, a

supported by continued strong corporate bond issuance and further gains in commercial F
and industrial (C&I) loans. In the household sector, nonrevolving consumer credit
expanded briskly, while revolving credit contracted somewhat after posting a robust
fourth-quarter increase. Mortgage refinancing activity remained subdued despite low
mortgage rates. Nonetheless, responses to the April SLOOS indicated that, in the
aggregate, modest net fractions of domestic banks eased their lending standards on core
loans and experienced somewhat stronger demand for such loans in the first quarter of
2012, and moderate to large net fractions of institutions had eased many terms on
C&I loans to firms of all sizes (see appendix).

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
Policy expectations edged down, while nominal Treasury yields ended the
intermeeting period about unchanged, on net, despite some notable fluctuations within
the period. The March FOMC statement prompted a modest rise in yields, reportedly as
market participants perceived a more optimistic tone in the economic assessment than
they had been expecting. Yields rose a bit further following the release of the CCAR
results later that afternoon and continued to move higher overnight as investors digested
the day’s news. Investors seemed to read the FOMC minutes as suggesting a higher bar
for additional balance sheet expansion than previously thought, prompting a notable
increase in policy expectations and longer-term Treasury yields. However, interest rates
dropped later in the period, as concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis and the
outlook for global growth resurfaced following downbeat news about the Spanish fiscal
situation and some soft economic data releases in the United States and abroad. In
particular, the March employment report came in weaker than investors had expected,
prompting a substantial decline in policy expectations and Treasury yields. Speeches by
FOMC participants over the period were interpreted as displaying a wide range of views
among Committee members regarding the outlook for monetary policy but appeared to
have only a modest effect on market measures of policy expectations and Treasury yields
on net.

increase in the federal funds rate. Dealers expected no major change in the language of

the FOMC statement at the April meeting except possibly an acknowledgment that the
pace of labor market improvement has slowed and tensions in European markets picked
up a bit. In response to questions about possible future options for easing, participants
assigned a slightly lower probability to additional securities purchases or changes in
balance sheet guidance and a slightly higher probability to a lengthening of the duration
of the SOMA portfolio within the next two years. Dealers largely maintained their
forecasts for real GDP growth and core and headline PCE inflation in the next
three years.
Treasury yields also edged down, remaining near the bottom end of their
historical range. (See the box “What Explains the Current Low Level of the

Treasury securities under the maturity extension program proceeded as planned and did
not appear to have any material adverse effect on Treasury market functioning.2
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years declined 13 basis
points, likely reflecting in part some recent stabilization in commodity prices. The
TIPS-based five-year forward measure increased 20 basis points on net; however,
swaps-based forward measures of inflation compensation indicate a much smaller

What Explains the Current Low Level
of the 10‐Year Treasury Term Premium?
Estimates of the 10‐year Treasury term premium from the staff’s standard term
structure model declined substantially from June 2011 through December 2011
and then increased modestly and are currently at a historically low level.1 These
changes in the estimates can be attributed to various factors, including safe‐
haven demand resulting from the European crisis, the maturity extension
program, and other economic variables. To examine the importance of these
factors, the estimated 10‐year term premium is regressed on a set of macro and
financial variables. On balance, this analysis attributes most of the decline in the
term premium from June 2011 to March 2012 to a reduction in uncertainty about
future interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s nonconventional monetary policy,
and investor concerns about the European debt situation.
The list of independent variables in the regression analysis includes interest rate
uncertainty (as measured by implied volatilities from near‐term options on 10‐
year Treasury note futures), capacity utilization (to capture the cyclicality of the
term premium), and foreign custody holdings of Treasury securities at the FRBNY
as a percentage of nominal GDP (to capture the relatively inelastic demand for
Treasury securities from foreign official institutions).2 In addition, the list
includes both the S&P 500 implied volatility and the 30‐day rolling correlation
between S&P 500 returns and changes in the 10‐year Treasury rate to capture the
safe‐haven demand for Treasury securities resulting from domestic equity market
s
t
n volatility. To capture the effects of total Treasury supply and SOMA holdings on
e
m term premiums, we include the amounts of Treasury securities outstanding and
p
o SOMA‐held Treasury securities, both measured in 10‐year equivalents, as a
l
v e percentage of nominal GDP.3 Finally, the average spread of Spanish and Italian
e
D 10‐year sovereign yields over German 10‐year sovereign yields is included as a
a l proxy for euro‐zone worries.4

The results of this regression are reported in the second column of the table
below. All parameter estimates are statistically significant and have the expected
signs. The third column in the table uses the model estimates to decompose the
change in the term premium over the period from June 2011 to March 2012. Out
of a total decrease of about 75 basis points in the estimated term premium over
this period, about 20 basis points can be attributed to lower interest rate
uncertainty, about 20 basis points to the change in SOMA Treasury holdings, and
about 20 basis points to concerns about the European crisis. The fit of the model
is better for the period from June 2011 through December 2011, and it attributes a
larger portion of the decline in the term premium over this period to rising
worries about the European situation. However, the regression predicts a
sharper rise in the term premium as those worries eased this year than is
estimated to have occurred.

Inflation Probability Distributions Implied by Inflation Caps
Inflation caps and floors are option‐like securities with payoffs tied to the rate of realized
headline CPI inflation measured at various horizons. A zero‐coupon inflation cap (floor)
delivers a nonzero payoff if the rate of cumulative inflation at the time of maturity is
above (below) the strike rate. The market for inflation caps started around 2007; it
remains small compared with the TIPS market, but market participants indicate that the
inflation caps market has been growing rapidly in recent years.1
The staff uses a nonparametric methodology to derive a risk‐neutral distribution of future
inflation based on caps with a range of strikes.2 The two panels in the figure below show
the estimated risk‐neutral probability distributions of annualized cumulative inflation
over the next 5 and 10 years, respectively, for the most recent date (solid bars) and the
day before the March FOMC meeting (dashed lines). 3 Some of the probability mass in
the right tail of the distribution for inflation over the next 5 years shifted notably to the
left over the intermeeting period, consistent with lower readings of inflation
compensation from TIPS and inflation swaps. In comparison, the risk‐neutral distribution
over the next 10 years remains largely unchanged.

The two panels in the figure below show changes in the same risk‐neutral probability
distributions over a six‐month period from October 18, 2011 (dashed lines), to April 17,
2012 (solid bars). Over the next 5 years, the implied distributions suggest a shift in the
probability mass away from low inflation outcomes toward inflation outcomes between
2 and 4 percent. Presumably, this shift reflects the gradual improvement in the U.S.
economic outlook and the recent run‐up in energy prices. Over the next 10 years, the
probability mass from the left tail of the distribution has shifted toward the center of the
distribution.
In summary, quotes on inflation caps and floors provide useful information about
changes in the perceived distributon of future inflation. The staff will continue to
monitor those instruments in addition to TIPS and inflation swaps in gauging inflation
expectations and market assessments of inflation risks.

maturity of unsecured financial commercial paper outstanding was about unchanged for
institutions with European parents and slightly higher for institutions with U.S. parents.
For both types of institutions, average maturities remained above recent historical
averages.
In secured funding markets, general collateral repo rates generally remained
slightly elevated, reportedly reflecting increased funding demand from dealers in the face
of heavy seasonal issuance of Treasury bills and continued sales of short-term securities
by the Federal Reserve. Spreads on overnight asset-backed commercial paper over rates
on AA-rated nonfinancial paper were unchanged to slightly lower, and the level of those
spreads remained similar for U.S. and European institutions.
Over the intermeeting period, equity prices of U.S. financial institutions
outperformed broader stock market indexes, boosted in part by the CCAR results, as
investors reportedly viewed the stressed capital ratios of some institutions as being higher
than expected and in some cases found the payouts to shareholders to be greater than
expected. First-quarter earnings at several large banking organizations also appeared to
come in somewhat above expectations, on balance, partly reflecting improvements in
mortgage banking revenue. CDS spreads for the largest domestic bank holding
s
t
n
e companies narrowed following the CCAR announcement. However, these spreads
m
p subsequently retraced when broader market sentiment appeared to turn more negative,
o
l
e
v and ended the period slightly wider on net. Bond issuance by financial firms picked up
e
D
further in March from its strong pace in the previous two months, as issuers took
l
a
i advantage of the improved market sentiment following the CCAR.

F On April 3, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the credit rating of GE
Capital’s senior unsecured debt to A1. The downgrade resulted from the implementation
of a revised global rating methodology for financial institutions that attributes a higher
risk profile to market-funded financial institutions. The firm’s CDS spreads have
widened moderately since the downgrade, in line with those of other large financial
institutions. While the possibility of additional ratings downgrades for financial
institutions remains in the near term, the effect on market sentiment appeared to be
limited.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Financial strains within the euro area increased over the period. Sovereign
spreads in Spain and Italy moved notably higher, European bank equity indexes dropped
sharply, and CDS premiums on Spanish banks surged. Partly as a result, headline foreign
equity indexes declined and corporate credit spreads widened.
Amid some volatility, yields on benchmark sovereign bonds for Germany, Japan,
and the United Kingdom ended the period roughly unchanged, and foreign headline
equity indexes declined 2 to 6 percent. Both benchmark yields and equities decreased
late in the period in reaction to weaker-than-expected euro-area macroeconomic data and
the U.S. employment report as well as to signs that financial pressures in the euro area
were increasing.
After falling steadily since late last year, sovereign spreads of Italian and Spanish
debt over comparable-maturity German bunds have risen sharply since the March FOMC
meeting. These spreads rose partly in response to news that Spain would miss its fiscal
target for this year and would need to make further budget cuts, as well as to renewed
concerns about the prospects for Spanish banks. Although funding pressures in the euro
interbank market continued to abate over the period, with the three-month euro
LIBOR–OIS spread narrowing to about 30 basis points, euro-area bank stocks plummeted t s
n
e
by over 14 percent, driven by sharp declines in the share prices of Spanish and Italian m
p
banks. In addition, five-year bank CDS premiums rose across the euro area; CDS o
l
e
v
premiums for Spanish banks increased sharply and reached levels close to the peaks seen e
D
last year. Despite a successful debt restructuring and a new aid package for Greece, the l
a
i
c
yield on Greece’s new post-restructuring, 10-year bond is above 21 percent, close to n
a
levels seen last September. n
i
F
The staff’s broad nominal dollar index is about unchanged over the intermeeting
period, as the dollar appreciated against most emerging market currencies but depreciated
moderately against the yen and sterling. Although the dollar was little changed against
the euro, the Swiss franc strengthened against the euro in response to the heightening of
concerns regarding the euro area and very briefly breached the Swiss National Bank’s
stated ceiling for the franc against the euro, prompting the central bank to reiterate that it
was prepared to prevent the franc from trading beyond that level.

The People’s Bank of China increased the width of its daily trading band of the
renminbi to plus or minus 1 percent from ½ percent. However, because the Chinese
authorities routinely intervene in the foreign exchange market and also reset the central
parity for the renminbi every day, this move does not necessarily imply a change in the
pace of appreciation. As part of its gradual efforts to internationalize its currency and
liberalize its markets, China allowed the government of Japan to buy Chinese
government debt, signed a currency swap agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia,
permitted greater foreign purchases of Chinese securities, and relaxed restrictions on
short sales of foreign currency.
Foreign official investors purchased a sizable amount of U.S. Treasury securities
in January and made additional purchases in February. Acquisitions were widespread
across countries and reflected in part a return to reserve accumulation by emerging
market economies in the first quarter. FRBNY custody data for March show further
moderate increases in official holdings of Treasury securities. TIC data for January and
February are consistent with some improvement in risk appetite among private investors
during those two months. Foreign private investors, on net, bought Treasury securities
over this period, although these purchases were well below the level of “flight to safety”
purchases in the fourth quarter. They returned to purchasing U.S. equities, although the
purchases were small. U.S. private investors purchased foreign equities in both January

the first quarter. Looking forward, an index of revisions to analysts’ forecasts of
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms is estimated to have registered roughly zero in
March and April, suggesting that the spate of negative revisions that occurred last fall and
winter has eased.
Yields and spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds changed little over the
intermeeting period, while yields and spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds
increased some on balance. Although yields on corporate bonds are low by historical
standards, staff models indicate that the risk premium component remains relatively
wide, suggesting that investors continued to be somewhat wary of corporate credit risk.
The spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on
highly rated nonfinancial issues were about flat, on net, over the intermeeting period.
BUSINESS FINANCE
Nonfinancial firms continued to raise funds at a strong pace over the intermeeting
period. Bond issuance by both investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial firms was
robust in the first quarter, as was the growth in C&I loans at commercial banks. By
contrast, the volume of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was little changed on
net. Leveraged loan issuance was strong in the first quarter, reportedly supported by
demand for assets from newly issued collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) as well as t s
n
e
pension funds and other institutional investors. Indeed, first-quarter CLO issuance, m
p
estimated at about $6 billion, was large by recent standards (a total of only $13 billion in o

CLOs was issued in all of 2011). Secondary-market syndicated loan prices were about e

Lagging data indicate that share repurchases and cash-financed mergers by nonfinancial
firms remained robust in the fourth quarter, leaving net equity issuance deeply negative.
Announcements of mergers and of new share repurchase programs suggest that equity
retirements were strong again in the first quarter.
Available indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to
be quite solid. The aggregate ratio of debt to assets is estimated to have been stable at a
relatively low level in the fourth quarter, as proceeds from firms’ heavy bond issuance
have been used, in large part, to refinance other debt, and the liquid asset ratio remained

near its highest level in more than 20 years. Over the first quarter, the pace at which
Moody’s upgraded nonfinancial corporate bonds exceeded that of downgrades. The
six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms remained low in February and
March, and the C&I loan delinquency rate fell again in the fourth quarter. The expected
year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s KMV model was
unchanged in March.
In contrast, financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector
remained strained amid weak fundamentals and tight underwriting conditions. Prices for
CRE properties continued to fluctuate at low levels, while vacancy rates and delinquency
rates remained elevated. CMBS issuance in the first quarter of 2012 is below that of the
first quarter of last year. CMBS delinquency rates ticked up again in March, as
borrowers struggled to refinance much of the approximately $33 billion in maturing
five-year loans that were originated at the peak of CRE prices in 2007. The
announcement of possible sales of Maiden Lane III assets on April 3 may also have
weighed on CMBS markets, as spreads on AAA tranches, which had narrowed since the
start of the year, widened notably following the announcement. That said, according to
the April SLOOS, a modest net fraction of domestic banks reported having eased
standards on CRE loans, and a significant net fraction experienced increased demand in
such loans.

By contrast, consumer credit has grown at a solid pace, on balance, in recent

strength in student loans, which are now almost entirely originated by the federal
government. Revolving credit contracted somewhat of late after posting robust gains in
the fourth quarter, in part because nonprime borrowers have continued to face tight
underwriting standards for credit cards. Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained

higher-quality borrowers due to still-tight credit conditions. Issuance of consumer ABS
ticked up in recent months, with auto loan ABS issuance particularly strong.
A set of special questions was included in the April SLOOS regarding banks’
residential real estate (RRE) lending policies. Almost uniformly and on a loan-weighted
basis, banks indicated that periods of high volumes of loan applications exceeding their
application processing capacity were a factor currently impeding their ability to originate
or purchase additional residential mortgage loans. In addition, banks primarily cited the
greater risk of putbacks of delinquent mortgages by the GSEs and borrowers’ higher
costs or increased difficulty in obtaining mortgage insurance as reasons why banks are
less likely to originate some GSE-eligible residential mortgage loans than they were in
2006. Looking ahead, portfolio-weighted survey responses indicated that a moderate net
fraction of banks anticipate reducing their exposure to RRE assets—such as residential
mortgage loans or government-backed or other mortgage-backed securities—over the
next year.
Another set of special questions in the April SLOOS asked about banks’
participation in HARP 2.0. On a portfolio-weighted basis, nearly three-fourths of the
respondents to the April SLOOS reported that they were “actively soliciting such
s
applications and satisfying most demand as it comes in.” 3 A similar fraction of banks n t
e
m
stated that, based on their experiences to date, they anticipated that 60 percent or more of
p
o
applications under HARP 2.0 would be approved and successfully completed. e l
v
e
Respondents reported that difficulties in securing transfers of existing private mortgage D
l
insurance coverage, identifying junior-lien holders, and obtaining resubordination of a a
i
c
n
known second lien were important factors reducing their willingness or ability to offer a
n
additional refinance loans through HARP 2.0. Only about one-fourth of respondents F i
reported that they were actively soliciting applications to refinance underwater loans
outside of HARP 2.0.
3 To date, HARP 2.0 does not appear to have had a material effect on aggregate mortgage
refinancing volume. The staff will have a better measure of this effect when the April Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac prepayment data are released in early May.

GOVERNMENT FINANCE
Since the March FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned
$199 billion in nominal securities and $13 billion in 10-year TIPS. The auctions were
generally well received, with bid-to-cover ratios and indirect bidding ratios close to their
recent averages. Market participants reportedly continued to expect that the Treasury
will announce its intention to introduce a floating-rate notes program in the May
quarterly refunding statement.
Gross long-term issuance of municipal bonds was subdued in the first quarter, and
net issuance of long-term bonds was slightly negative, as municipalities appeared
reluctant to increase their debt levels despite generally accommodative market
conditions. Ratings downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to
substantially outpace upgrades in the fourth quarter, and higher-frequency data on ratings
changes suggest that this trend likely continued in the first quarter of 2012. Nevertheless,
average CDS spreads for states declined, on net, over the intermeeting period, and yields
on long-term general obligation municipal bonds moved up only modestly.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
Bank credit slowed in March but expanded at a solid 4½ percent pace in the first
s
t
n
quarter as a whole. The recent deceleration was mainly attributable to a few banks e
m
reducing their holdings of securities rather than to a renewed slowdown in loan growth. p
o
l
e
Indeed, core loans continued to show modest gains in March and have now increased for v
e
D
10 consecutive months. The expansion of C&I loans at domestic banks remained robust
l
a
in March, with growth concentrated at large domestic banks. In contrast, C&I loans at i
c
n
branches and agencies of foreign banks declined, continuing a general pattern of relative a
n
i
F
weakness since late last year. Growth in real estate loans remained mixed in March.
While CRE loans and home equity loans continued to run off, banks’ holdings of
closed-end residential mortgage loans expanded moderately. Consumer loans on banks’
books rose modestly, partially reversing their recent declines. Reportedly, growth has
been fueled by originations of new auto loans, and banks are actively pursuing new
personal loans. Noncore loans, which had been quite strong during much of 2011, have
been slowing over the past four months. Banks’ holdings of securities increased during
March at a slower pace than in previous months.

The April SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, domestic banks eased their
lending standards on core loans modestly and experienced somewhat stronger demand for
such loans in the first quarter of 2012. Regarding C&I loans, very large net fractions of
domestic banks indicated that they reduced spreads of C&I loan rates over their cost of
funds to firms of all sizes; the net fractions of banks that reported such decreases were
near the highest on record. In addition, modest net fractions reported easing standards on
C&I loans to large and middle-market firms; standards on loans to small firms were little
changed. Domestic banks also reported an increase in demand for C&I loans, on balance,
from firms of all sizes. Only a modest net fraction of domestic banks reported having
eased standards on CRE loans, though a significant net fraction reported having seen
increased demand for such loans. In contrast to their domestic counterparts, branches and
agencies of foreign banks reported that spreads on C&I loans were about unchanged,
standards on such loans were tightened, and loan demand had weakened. Concerning
lending conditions for households, when responses are weighted by banks’ holdings of
RRE loans, the survey showed that standards on such loans were little changed on net. In
addition, small net fractions of banks reported having eased standards and seen increased
demand on most types of consumer loans, especially auto loans, in the first quarter.
The M2 aggregate expanded moderately again in March, reflecting growth in
liquid deposits and currency that was partially offset by further declines in small time
s
t
n
e deposits and balances in retail money market funds. However, the levels of M2 and its
m
p largest component, liquid deposits, remain elevated relative to what would be expected
o
l
e
v based on historical relationships with nominal income and opportunity costs, suggesting
e
D
investors’ continued strong desire to hold safe and liquid assets. Currency advanced at a
l
a
i 10¾ percent annual rate in March, as both domestic and foreign demand for U.S. bank
c
n
a notes appeared to increase solidly. In spite of the solid growth in currency, the monetary
n
i
F
base contracted at an 18½ percent annual rate in March, reflecting a sharp decline in
reserve balances that month that was driven mainly by a decrease in foreign central
banks’ draws on the dollar liquidity swap lines. (See the box “Balance Sheet
Developments over the Intermeeting Period” for a discussion of changes in reserve
balances and other balance sheet items since mid-March.)

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
Over the intermeeting period, total assets of the Federal Reserve decreased
$12 billion to $2,881 billion (see the table on the next page).
Since the March FOMC meeting, the Open Market Desk conducted 25 operations
as part of the maturity extension program: The Desk purchased $56 billion in
Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years and sold $44 billion
in Treasury securities with maturities of 3 months to 3 years.1 In addition, the
Desk purchased $35 billion in agency MBS securities as part of the policy of
reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS.2
Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decreased $33 billion to $32 billion, reflecting
a decline in draws by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The net
portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC and Maiden Lane II LLC declined $2 billion
and $4 billion, respectively, primarily because of asset sales. Proceeds from asset
sales from the Maiden Lane II portfolio enabled the repayment of the remaining
outstanding balances of the loans from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
(FRBNY) and AIG to Maiden Lane II on March 1, 2012, and March 15, 2012,
respectively.3 After review with the Board, the investment objective of Maiden
Lane III was revised on April 3, 2012, and now is consistent with asset sales; no
sales have taken place yet, although a competitive bidding process for the largest
position in the portfolio has been initiated.4 The net portfolio holdings of Maiden
Lane III LLC were about unchanged over the intermeeting period. Loans
s outstanding under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were
t
n
e slightly lower, reflecting, in part, the first maturity of a TALF loan with a three‐
m
year initial term.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
Overall, in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,
modest net fractions of domestic banks reported having eased their lending standards and having
experienced stronger demand over the past three months.1 Econometric analysis shows that the
amount of easing reported in the April survey was somewhat more than might have been
expected after accounting for a number of bank-specific factors and the evolution of several key
macroeconomic variables over the survey period. Meanwhile, modest net fractions of foreign
respondents, which mainly lend to businesses, reported having tightened lending standards and
having experienced decreased demand for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. The April
survey contained a number of special questions regarding banks’ residential real estate lending
policies; it also repeated a set of special questions on lending to firms with exposures to European
economies.
The survey results for C&I loans are consistent with continued strong growth in such
loans held on banks’ books in recent months. A modest net fraction of domestic banks reportedly
eased standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms.2 Standards to small firms for
such loans were reportedly about unchanged. No domestic bank indicated having tightened
standards on C&I loans. Moderate to large net fractions of domestic banks eased many terms on
C&I loans to firms of all sizes. Domestic banks also reported an increase in demand from firms
of all sizes. A considerable fraction of domestic banks noted an increase in business as a result of
s
t
a decrease in competition from European banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries. Indeed, a n
e
m
small net fraction of foreign respondents again reported a tightening of their lending standards on
p
o
C&I loans and a decrease in demand for such loans. l
e
v
e
D
A modest net fraction of domestic banks reported having eased standards for commercial
l
a
real estate (CRE) loans. In the January survey, banks had indicated little change in standards for i
c
n
such loans. As has been the case recently, significant net fractions of domestic banks reported a
n
that demand for CRE loans had strengthened. On net, foreign branches and agencies reported i
F
that standards and demand for CRE loans were little changed.
1 The April 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses
and households over the past three months. This appendix is based on responses from 57 domestic banks
and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Respondent banks received the survey on or after
March 27, 2012, and responses were due by April 10, 2012.
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased
standards. For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.
2 Large and middle-market firms are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million or
more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

In response to a set of special questions, most of which were also asked in the previous
two surveys, both domestic and foreign banks again reported tightening standards on loans to
European banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries as well as on loans to nonfinancial firms with
substantial business in Europe. However, the net fractions reporting such tightening were much
smaller than in the January survey.
Regarding loans to households, on a loan-weighted basis, standards on prime residential
mortgage loans were about unchanged. 3 Standards for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)
were little changed on net. However, the April survey also indicated a small weakening in
demand for both types of loans on a weighted basis. Looking ahead, on a loan-weighted basis a
moderate net fraction of banks anticipate reducing their exposure to residential real estate assets
over the next year. With respect to consumer loans, on a loan-weighted basis, moderate net
fractions of banks reported that they had eased standards on most types of these loans over the
past three months. In addition, demand for all types of consumer loans increased somewhat, on
net, with demand for auto loans showing the largest increase.
In response to a set of special questions on banks’ residential real estate lending policies,
banks cited a variety of factors that were limiting their current ability to originate or purchase
additional residential real estate (RRE) loans. In particular, respondents almost uniformly
indicated that there have been periods in which the volume of loan applications exceeded their
capacity to process such loans. In addition, survey respondents generally indicated that, relative
to 2006, they were less willing to originate GSE-eligible residential mortgage loans for home
purchases by borrowers with low FICO scores. One of the most important factors for this
decrease in willingness was a higher risk of putbacks by the GSEs of mortgages that could
become delinquent. Another was the higher cost of, and greater difficulty that borrowers had in t s
n
obtaining, mortgage insurance. e
m
p
o
A large share of banks reported that they were actively soliciting applications for the e l
v
revised Home Affordable Refinance Program, or “HARP 2.0.” Most banks reported that they e
D
expect that a majority of the applications for the program will be approved and successfully l
a
i
completed. Respondents also noted that a variety of factors had limited their willingness to offer c
n
a
refinancing loans through HARP 2.0. Some of the factors cited as most important were the risk n
i
that the GSEs might put back the mortgage and difficulty in securing transfer of existing private F
mortgage insurance coverage.

Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending
A modest net fraction of domestic banks stated that their credit standards on C&I loans to
large and middle-market firms eased over the first quarter of 2012. Standards on such loans to

branches and agencies of foreign banks reportedly tightened their standards on C&I loans for the
third consecutive quarter. The tightening by foreign survey respondents was limited to some of
the U.S. branches and agencies of European banks.
Moderate to large net fractions of domestic banks eased many terms on C&I loans to
firms of all sizes. A very large fraction of respondents indicated that they had decreased spreads
on C&I loan rates over the cost of funds to both large and middle market firms and to small firms.
The net fractions of banks reporting these decreases are near the highest on record. A sizeable net
fraction of banks also indicated a reduction in their use of interest rate floors.
Almost all domestic banks that reported having eased standards or terms on C&I loans
cited more-aggressive competition from other banks and nonbank lenders as a reason for having
done so, with fewer than half of those banks attributing the change to an improved or less
uncertain economic outlook. The few banks that reported having tightened at least one C&I loan
term cited a variety of reasons, including a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a
worsening of industry-specific problems, a reduced tolerance for risk, and increased concerns
about legislative, supervisory, or accounting policies.
Meanwhile, a moderate net fraction of foreign survey respondents increased the costs of
credit lines on C&I loans. A few European respondents acknowledged an increased cost of funds
due to more-expensive dollar funding. The foreign respondents that reported having tightened
their standards or terms on C&I loans cited a variety of reasons, including a less favorable or
more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific problems, a reduced tolerance
for risk, deterioration in their current of expected liquidity position, and increased concerns about
t s legislative, supervisory, or accounting policies.
n
e
m
p For the second straight survey, reports from domestic banks of stronger demand for C&I
o
e l loans outnumbered reports of weaker demand. About two-thirds of the domestic respondents
v
e who reported competing with European banks for business noted an increase in business as a
D
l result of decreased competition from European banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries.
a
i
c Domestic banks also reported a net increase in the number of inquiries from potential business
n
a
n borrowers regarding new or increased credit lines. Banks reporting stronger demand cited shifts
i
F in borrowing from other bank and nonbank sources, as well as increases in customers’ funding
needs related to inventories, investment in plant or equipment, accounts receivable, and mergers
and acquisitions as important factors underlying the increase. The small fraction of banks
indicating that demand had decreased cited an increase in their customers’ internally generated
funds, as well as decreases in customers’ funding needs related to inventories, investment in plant
or equipment, accounts receivable, and mergers and acquisitions. In contrast, a small net fraction
of foreign respondents saw weaker demand for C&I loans, and those that did cited customers’
decreased investment in plant and equipment and reduced financing needs for merger or
acquisition activity as some of the reasons.

Special Questions on Lending to Firms with European Exposures
A set of special questions in the April survey asked respondents about lending to banks
headquartered in Europe and their affiliates or subsidiaries (regardless of the location of the
affiliates and subsidiaries), as well as to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United
States and significant exposure to European economies (regardless of the location of the firms).
Most of these questions were also asked in the previous two surveys, conducted in January 2012
and October 2011.
Moderate net fractions of both domestic and foreign respondents reported having
tightened standards on loans to European banks, and small net fractions stated that they had also
tightened standards on loans to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United States and
significant exposure to European economies. However, in all cases, the net fractions that
reported having tightened were substantially smaller than in the January survey. Demand for
credit was reportedly little changed, on net, from European banks (or their affiliates and
subsidiaries) and from nonfinancial firms with significant European exposures.
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending
A modest net fraction of domestic banks reported easing their standards on CRE loans in
the April survey. Even so, lending standards on CRE loans likely remain relatively tight: Such
standards were widely described in a special question in the July 2011 survey (four quarters ago)
as being at or near their tightest levels since 2005, and these standards were reportedly little
changed over the previous three surveys. Foreign survey respondents indicated that their
standards on CRE loans were about unchanged.

As has been the case in recent surveys, moderate net fractions of domestic banks reported n
e
m
that demand for CRE loans had strengthened, on net, over the past three months. In contrast, the
p

foreign respondents reported that demand for CRE loans had changed little over that period. The

Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending
Most banks continued to report little net change in standards on prime residential
mortgage loans, when responses are weighted by the outstanding closed-end mortgage balances
held on the respondents’ books. Moreover, weighted responses, which may better account for
overall activity in mortgage lending given that it is highly concentrated among the largest banks,
have also shown weaker demand. On a weighted basis, banks reported standards on
nontraditional residential mortgage loans were little changed, while a moderate net fraction
reported weaker demand for those loans.
When survey responses are weighted by the amount of banks’ outstanding HELOCs,
standards on that category of credit were little changed over the past three months. The previous

five surveys had shown easings on standards for HELOCs. Meanwhile, the demand for such
loans continued to weaken, on net, if the responses are weighted. The small amount of easing in
standards and the weakness in demand are consistent with the continued runoff in banks’ holdings
of HELOCs.
Special Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending
A set of special questions asked survey respondents about residential real estate lending
policies at their institutions. One such question asked banks about factors currently affecting
their ability to originate or purchase additional RRE loans. Almost uniformly, on a loan-weighted
basis banks cited periods during which the high volume of RRE loan applications exceeded their
application processing capacity as a factor. More than half of banks cited difficulties in
completing timely and accurate underwriting as at least somewhat of a factor, while about
one-third of respondents reported difficulty in completing timely and accurate appraisals or in
hiring sufficient servicing or loan processing staff as at least somewhat of a factor.
Banks were also asked to compare their willingness to originate a GSE-eligible 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage loan intended for home purchase today with their willingness in 2006 for
borrowers with FICO (or equivalent) credit risk scores of 620, 680, and 720, and down payments
of 10 or 20 percent (for a total of six categories of borrowers). When weighted by their holdings
of RRE loans, somewhat more than half of banks indicated that they were less likely to originate
a GSE-eligible mortgage loan to potential borrowers with a FICO score of 620 and a 10 percent
down payment than they were in 2006. Raising the down payment to 20 percent reduced the
fraction of banks less likely to originate such a loan to about 40 percent. Less than 20 percent of
banks were less likely to originate loans to borrowers with a FICO score of 680, regardless of
s
down payment size, and banks were, on net, about as likely to originate loans to borrowers with a n t
e
FICO score of 720 now as they were in 2006. These results are broadly consistent with data m
p
showing changes between 2006 and 2011 in the number and share of loans actually originated to o
l
e
borrowers with such characteristics. Almost all banks cited borrowers having higher costs or v
e
greater difficulty in obtaining mortgage insurance coverage as an important factor contributing to D
l
the reduced likelihood of originating GSE-eligible mortgage loans. A somewhat smaller fraction a
i
c
of respondents noted the higher risk of putbacks of delinquent mortgages by the GSEs as an n
a
n
important factor; however, that factor was listed as the most important one by the largest number
i
F
of banks. More than half of respondents reported higher servicing costs if mortgages were to
become delinquent and less favorable or more uncertain outlooks for house prices, or the
economy more broadly, as important reasons.
Several special questions asked about banks’ participation in HARP 2.0. When weighted
by RRE loans held in their portfolios, nearly three-fourths of banks reported that they were
actively soliciting HARP 2.0 applications and satisfying most demand as it came in. A similar
fraction reported that they anticipated that 60 percent or more of such applications would be

approved and successfully completed.4 About three-fourths of respondents reported difficulty in
obtaining transfers of existing private mortgage insurance coverage as a factor reducing their
willingness or ability to offer additional refinance loans through HARP 2.0. Nearly half of
respondents cited difficulty in identifying junior lien holders or in obtaining resubordination of a
known second lien as a factor reducing their willingness or ability to offer such loans.
Meanwhile, only about one-third of respondents cited the risk that the GSEs might put back the
mortgage as an at least somewhat important factor, although among all factors it was rated as the
most important one by the largest number of respondents. On a portfolio-weighted basis, about
one-fourth of banks reported that they were actively soliciting applications and satisfying most
demand as it came in for refinancing underwater loans outside of HARP 2.0 for borrowers who
have been current on their existing mortgage for at least 12 months.
Looking ahead, on a portfolio-weighted basis, a moderate net fraction of banks reported
that they anticipated reducing their exposure to RRE assets over the next year (such as RRE loans
or government backed or other mortgage-backed securities), suggesting that, in the aggregate, the
amount of residential mortgage loans available to consumers is likely to contract. However, these
results are attributable to the answers of a few very large banks. On an unweighted basis, the
majority of banks indicated that they expected to increase their exposure to the residential
mortgage market.
Questions on Consumer Lending
As in the previous four surveys, on a portfolio-weighted basis, small fractions of
domestic banks reported having eased standards on auto and other consumer loans. In contrast,
standards on credit card loans were tightened modestly. All three loan categories saw modest t s
n
easings of standards on an unweighted basis. Moderate net fractions of banks reported having e
m
narrowed spreads on auto and other consumer loans. However, other terms across the categories p
o
l
of consumer loans were little changed on net. e

A moderate net fraction of banks reported stronger demand for auto loans, consistent with l

F
net share of banks that indicated that they experienced higher demand for other consumer loans
increased a bit relative to the previous survey. Net fractions for all three categories were
somewhat larger than was the case in the January survey.
4 To date, HARP does not appear to have had a material effect on aggregate mortgage refinancing
volume. Staff will have a better measure of this effect when the April Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
prepayment data are released in early May.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY
We continue to view the risks around our projection for economic activity as
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by
the FOMC).1 The aftereffects of the financial crisis and subsequent recession still impart
an unusual degree of uncertainty regarding the level of economic slack and the future
pace of the recovery. However, relative to the January Tealbook, when we last reported
our assessment of this issue, we now consider the risks around the outlook for real
activity to be roughly balanced rather than clearly skewed to the downside. Recent
improvements in labor market conditions, industrial production, and consumer spending
increase the probability that a more robust recovery than we have projected could
develop. At the same time, considerable downside risks remain, most notably those
associated with the European fiscal and financial situation. Moreover, the capacity of
U.S. fiscal or monetary policy to counteract any weakening in economic activity is
uncertain.
With regard to inflation, although we see substantial uncertainty about our
inflation projection, we do not view these risks as unusually high. Long-run inflation
expectations have remained relatively stable, and the evolution of inflation over the past
several years has been fairly consistent with our assessment of how anchored inflation
expectations, changes in the prices of crude oil and other commodities, and economic
slack influence consumer prices. Moreover, we continue to see the risks surrounding our
baseline forecast as balanced. On the downside, low levels of resource utilization,
subdued increases in unit labor costs, and the possibility that economic conditions might
be less favorable than in the baseline could cause inflation to drift down over time. On
the upside, concerns related to the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the
ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy might cause inflation to
y
1 This assessment of heightened uncertainty holds even though the benchmark estimates of t
n
uncertainty about real activity have increased markedly over the past few years. In particular, as the fixed a i
t
20-year window used to assess the typical size of forecast errors has rolled forward to include the e r
c
pronounced volatility of the past few years, the estimated standard errors for out-year projections of the n
U
unemployment rate almost doubled between 2008 and 2011, and have remained at this higher level with the
&
new sample. Thus, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity are no longer dominated by
s
the experience of the Great Moderation period. In contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about k
s
inflation are essentially unchanged. R i

rise, as could a sharper depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar or a larger
amount of damage to the supply side of the economy.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first
scenario considers the upside risk that the recent improvements in some measures of
economic activity are early indications that the recovery will accelerate more rapidly than
anticipated. The second scenario builds on the previous one by assuming that, in the
context of a robust economic expansion, the unprecedented size of the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet causes inflation expectations to rise. The third scenario examines the
downside risk associated with a “fiscal cliff” at the beginning of 2013. The fourth
scenario considers the risk that the continued high level and duration of unemployment
over the next few years lead to more-significant corrosion in the long-run productive
capacity of the economy than assumed in the baseline. The fifth scenario considers the
possibility that inflation will decline by more than we anticipate because the persistently
wide margins of slack in labor and product markets begin to erode inflation expectations.
The sixth scenario analyzes the risk to the U.S. economic outlook associated with a
severe fiscal and financial crisis in Europe that spills over to the United States and the
rest of the global economy. The last scenario considers the effects of a substantial
increase in oil prices caused by heightened geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions.
We generate the first five scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated
policy rule for the federal funds rate that responds to core PCE inflation and the staff’s
estimate of economic slack. The last two scenarios are generated using the multicountry
SIGMA model and a different policy rule that employs an alternative concept of resource
utilization.2 In all of the scenarios, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are
assumed to follow their baseline paths.

upturn in house prices for some time could indicate that a faster-paced recovery may be
emerging. This scenario assumes that a stronger self-reinforcing cycle materializes, with
increasing optimism and declining aversion to risk leading to higher consumer
expenditures, more hiring and investment spending by firms, and improved credit
availability and overall financial conditions: After several years during which it has been
a drag on activity, the financial accelerator shifts into forward gear. This virtuous circle
causes real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 3¾ percent on average until 2014, roughly
1 percentage point higher than in baseline. As a result, the unemployment rate declines
to 6¼ percent by the end of 2014, 1 percentage point below baseline. Upward pressure
on inflation is initially tempered by the effects of the higher level of capital investment on
labor productivity and unit labor costs, along with well-anchored long-run inflation
expectations. Over time, however, tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to
move noticeably above baseline. In response to the stronger pace of real activity, the
federal funds rate begins to rise in the second half of this year.
Virtuous Circle with Higher Inflation
In the previous scenario, we assumed that long-run inflation expectations would
remain well anchored despite a fairly sizable acceleration in real economic activity.
However, in the context of a faster recovery, the unprecedented size of the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet and the excess reserves held by banks could fuel an expansion in
lending large enough to spark concerns about the ability of monetary policy to react in a
timely manner to keep inflation pressures in check. Reflecting these concerns, this
scenario builds on the previous one by assuming that long-run inflation expectations rise
to 2¾ percent by the end of next year, causing headline inflation to reach 2½ percent by
2014 and 3 percent thereafter. In response to higher inflation, the federal funds rate rises
more steeply and is 1 percentage point higher in both 2014 and 2015 than it was in the
previous scenario. With tighter monetary policy, the growth rate of real activity by the
middle of the decade is somewhat more restrained and the unemployment rate ends up at
5¾ percent by the end of 2017, almost ½ percentage point higher than in the preceding
scenario.

i
R

--- Page 97 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) April 18, 2012
that all of these tax provisions are allowed to expire next year, increasing household and
business tax payments by a total of about 2 percent of GDP relative to baseline. In
addition, the automatic spending cuts required by the sequestration associated with the
Budget Control Act take full effect in 2013 rather than being phased in gradually as
assumed in the baseline, thereby restraining federal purchases by ¼ percent of GDP
relative to baseline.3 Moreover, these developments, in conjunction with the political
wrangling likely to surround the raising of the federal debt limit late in the year, are
assumed to weigh on consumer and business confidence. All told, real GDP expands
only 1½ percent in 2013 and 2¾ percent in 2014, on average 1 percentage point per year
slower than in the baseline.4 As a result, the unemployment rate is still above 8 percent
at the end of 2014. With a wider margin of slack in both labor and product markets,
inflation edges down to 1¼ percent in 2014, and the federal funds rate does not begin to
increase until early 2015.
Corrosion
Our baseline projection assumes that the persistence of a wide margin of slack in
labor markets will not appreciably reduce future expansion of the productive capacity of
the economy. In this scenario, the continued underutilization of labor resources begins to
significantly erode the skills and labor force attachment of unemployed workers while
intensifying the mismatch in the labor market. In particular, the NAIRU rises from its
assumed current level of 6 percent to 7 percent by the end of 2014, 1 percentage point
above baseline; the NAIRU remains at 7 percent thereafter. In addition, the trend labor
force participation rate falls steadily to 63 percent by the end of 2014, 1 percentage point
below baseline. This greater labor market damage reduces the level of potential output
by 2 percent by the end of 2014 relative to baseline. Under these conditions, real GDP
rises at an average annual rate of only a little more than 2 percent through the middle of
the decade as households and businesses recognize the weaker trajectory of income and
earnings. The expansion in aggregate demand is sufficiently weak that the
unemployment rate remains above 8 percent through 2016. As a result, economic slack is
on average little different from baseline despite the more-pronounced deterioration in the
y supply-side conditions of the economy, so inflation is only slightly higher. With both the

c
n trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that are about the same as in the baseline but resulting in a

lower ratio of government debt to GDP.
& 4 Although taxes increase by 2 percent of GDP, the effects on spending are considerably smaller in
s
k the short run as households in the FRB/US model adjust their spending only gradually to changes in

amount of slack and inflation similar to the baseline, the path for the federal funds rate is
also comparable to the baseline.
Disinflation
The stability of various measures of expected inflation may be misleading us
about the potential for further disinflation, particularly in the context of a baseline
outlook in which a considerable margin of slack in labor and product markets persists for
some time. In this scenario, both expected and actual inflation drift down over time, with
core PCE inflation falling to below ½ percent by 2014; such declines would be in line
with the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips curve models. As inflation slows,
financial market participants are assumed to become increasingly concerned that the
economy could fall into persistent deflation; as a result, bond premiums increase, which
restrains spending modestly and raises unemployment relative to baseline. In response to
lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate remains at its effective
lower bound until the end of 2015.
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers
In this scenario, the recent slippage in European financial market conditions
presages an even sharper downturn, and Europe plunges into a severe financial crisis and
a deep recession. This outcome could result from some combination of a disorderly
sovereign default, the failure of a large European financial institution, and a loss of
confidence by the public in the ability of European governments to resolve the crisis.
Reflecting this stress, both sovereign and private borrowing costs in Europe soar—with
corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline—and the confidence of
households and businesses plummets. Real GDP in Europe declines more than 8 percent
relative to baseline by the end of 2013, notwithstanding a 20 percent depreciation in the
real effective foreign exchange value of the euro. Europe’s difficulties are assumed to
have important financial and economic spillovers to other parts of the world, including
the United States. U.S. economic activity contracts sharply in response to a widening of
U.S. corporate bond spreads of more than 300 basis points, a much weaker stock market,
reduced access to credit, and an erosion in household and business confidence. In y
t
n
addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar i

r
depress U.S. net exports. All told, U.S. real GDP declines at an annual rate of 2¾ percent e

zero in the second half of 2012 and in 2013; inflation turns positive in 2014 as an
economic recovery begins to take hold.5 Under these conditions, the federal funds rate
remains near zero until the second half of 2016.
Higher Oil Prices
The continued tension with Iran over its nuclear program highlights the
significant upside risks to our outlook for oil prices. In this scenario, we assume that
geopolitical developments and supply disruptions temporarily push oil prices
$50 per barrel above baseline in the current quarter, but that oil prices gradually recede
thereafter. Although a supply-driven increase in oil prices would ordinarily be expected
to cause the dollar to depreciate, we assume instead that heightened geopolitical tensions
increase the demand for dollar-denominated assets and cause the dollar to appreciate
slightly. U.S. domestic demand falls relative to baseline because higher oil prices
effectively reduce the real incomes of households and lower the return on firms’
investments, while real exports also decline due to weaker foreign economic activity. All
told, U.S. real GDP rises only about 2 percent, on average, this year and next, and the
unemployment rate remains elevated, ending 2014 at 8 percent, ½ percentage point
higher than in the baseline. Reflecting the rise in energy costs, overall PCE inflation
averages 3½ percent this year but then moderates as oil prices begin to decline. Core
inflation is boosted modestly relative to baseline for several years as firms pass on their
higher production costs to consumers. Although the liftoff of the federal funds rate is
unchanged from baseline, the removal of monetary accommodation thereafter proceeds a
bit more gradually.
OUTSIDE FORECASTS
In the April 10 report (which was based on responses collected on April 4 and 5
before the release of the most recent labor market report), the Blue Chip consensus
projection showed real GDP rising 2.4 percent over the four quarters of 2012 and
increasing 2.7 percent in 2013, both similar to the staff forecast. The Blue Chip
y
5 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking t
n
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA. In particular, long-run inflation expectations remain firmly a i
t
anchored at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and e r
c
productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital spending). In addition, import price inflation runs n
U
significantly higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial appreciation is gradually reversed. Under
&
alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, allow for more structural persistence in the inflation
s
process or a less-firm anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period. k

consensus forecast for the unemployment rate was 8.0 percent at the end of 2012, the
same as in the staff projection, and 7½ percent at the end of 2013, ¼ percentage point
below the staff projection. Regarding inflation, the consensus of Blue Chip panelists
anticipated that the overall CPI will increase 2.3 percent in 2012 and 2.2 percent in 2013,
¼ and ¾ percentage point above the staff projection in, respectively, this year and 2013.
