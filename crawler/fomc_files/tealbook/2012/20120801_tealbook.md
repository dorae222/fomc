Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information we have received since the June Tealbook suggests that the D
n
recovery is proceeding at a more sluggish pace than we thought six weeks ago. Incoming o
c
E
news on consumer spending, government purchases, private-sector employment, and
c
i
t
industrial production have all been softer than expected, and we have marked down our s
e
m
estimate of real GDP growth in the first half of this year from 1¾ percent to 1½ percent.1 o
D
The recent data, combined with the disappointing tone of some more-forward-looking
indicators, have led us to trim a similar amount from our projection for real GDP growth
in the second half of this year, which now also stands at an annual rate of about
1½ percent.
The current projection takes on board the continuation of the maturity extension
program (MEP) that the Committee adopted in June. However, it also sees the
underlying trajectory for economic activity as having weakened somewhat. In our
assessment, these two opposing influences are of roughly equal strength. As a result, the
contour of our medium-term projection is quite similar to the one in the previous
Tealbook. Although the situation in Europe remains a source of great uncertainty, thus
far it appears to be unfolding approximately as we had expected. Financial stresses in
Europe are anticipated to intensify further this year and then recede slowly thereafter, as
policymakers are finally impelled to take more-aggressive steps to avert a catastrophe.
Similarly, we continue to assume that domestic fiscal policy will restrain economic
growth considerably next year, but that fiscal policymakers will find a way to sidestep the
even more severe consolidation that would ensue if all provisions of current law were
allowed to take effect. Taking into account these influences, we project that real GDP
will rise 1½ percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 3¼ percent in 2014. In addition to
exerting important influences on the baseline forecast, the European financial crisis and
domestic fiscal situation both continue to pose significant downside risks to the outlook.
With growth in real GDP expected to be close to that of potential output through
2013, no material progress is made in reducing the slack in labor markets until late in the
forecast period. Indeed, we project that the jobless rate will tick up in the second half of
1 On Friday, the BEA will publish the annual revision to the national income and product accounts
covering the first quarter of 2009 through the first quarter of 2012. At the same time, they will release the
advance GDP estimate for the second quarter of this year

this year before edging down ¼ percentage point to a little over 8 percent by the end of u t
O
2013. Moreover, even the slight decline next year is attributable, in our reckoning, to the
&
expiration at the beginning of the year of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation e l
v
e
(EUC) program. By the end of 2014, the unemployment rate is expected to decrease to D

7¾ percent, about the same as in the previous Tealbook. o

Readings on inflation have come in near our expectations, and the fundamental t
s
e
m
inflation picture remains as it has for some time: With long-term inflation expectations
o
D
assumed to remain well anchored but wide margins of slack in labor and product markets
expected to persist, our baseline forecast has inflation running at about 1½ percent over
the medium term. Compared with the June Tealbook, our projection of total consumer
price inflation this year is about ¼ percentage point higher, reflecting the recent rise in oil
prices along with higher food price inflation later this year that is related to the current
drought in the Midwest. Beyond this year, our inflation forecast is little revised.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
The stance of monetary policy is slightly more accommodative in this projection.
In line with the prescriptions from the estimated outcome-based policy rule, we assume
that liftoff of the target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will occur in the
fourth quarter of 2014, one quarter later than in the June Tealbook. In addition, our
assumed portfolio-related policy now reflects the extension of the MEP that the FOMC
announced after the June meeting. We assume no additional balance-sheet actions over
the projection period.
The path of the federal funds rate would differ if we had chosen some other
method to set it.2 As discussed in Book B, liftoff would occur in the second quarter of
2015 if we had used a rule that targets the level of nominal GDP, and not until the second
quarter of 2016 under a standard optimal control exercise with commitment.3 Liftoff
would occur in the same quarter as in the baseline if we had followed the prescriptions of
the Taylor (1999) rule. In contrast, the Taylor (1993) rule and the first-difference rule
2 For details on the outcome-based and other policy rules, see the appendix on policy rules in
Book B.
3 The optimal control policy noted here is conducted under the strong assumption that, if economic
conditions were to evolve as expected, future policymakers would remain committed to the plan currently
judged to be optimal. If future policymakers were instead assumed to follow a discretionary policy of
reoptimizing over time, then the optimal-control liftoff date would shift back to the second quarter of 2015.

u t call for a liftoff of the federal funds rate that is earlier than under the outcome-based rule;

&

v
e
D
n Other Interest Rates
o
c
E The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has decreased about 25 basis points, on
c
i
s t net, since the June Tealbook. This decline reflects weaker-than-expected economic news,
e
m
safe-haven flows related to ongoing concerns about the euro-area situation, and the
o
D
announced continuation of the MEP, which was only partly priced in to yields at the time
of the June Tealbook. Over the projection period, the MEP is expected to hold down the
10-year Treasury yield by about 10 basis points. Through early 2013, Treasury yields
continue to be damped by safe-haven demands stemming from the European financial
crisis and the effects of uncertainty about the U.S. fiscal situation on the pace of the
economic recovery. As these concerns abate and the economic recovery strengthens, the
path of Treasury yields rises, reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window
through the period of near-zero short-term interest rates, along with a gradual waning of
the effects of nonconventional monetary policy. In total, the 10-year Treasury rate
increases by 2 percentage points over the forecast horizon, bringing the rate to around
3½ percent by late 2014.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have decreased roughly 40 basis
points since the June Tealbook, about 20 basis points more than yields on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities. Over the projection period, we assume that the spread on
BBB-rated bonds will hold fairly steady until early 2013 and then narrow nearly a full
percentage point by the end of 2014 as the recovery accelerates. As a result, interest rates
on BBB-rated bonds increase only half as much as those on comparable-maturity
Treasury securities and are projected to be about 5¼ percent by the end of 2014. In
contrast, conventional mortgage rates largely follow Treasury rates.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have edged up about 1 percent, on net, since the
June Tealbook. We project only a modest increase in stock prices through early 2013, as
concerns about the circumstances in Europe and the effects of the U.S. fiscal situation are
4 All of these estimates allow for dynamic feedback from the stance of monetary policy to the real
economy and inflation, which can have important implications for the estimated timing of tightening under
the different rules.

assumed to continue to weigh on the confidence of market participants. With these u t

The CoreLogic house price index rose in May about in line with our expectations. n
o
c
We continue to expect that the brisk pace of house price increases observed in the first E

half of 2012 will slow considerably later this year, partly in response to an expected t
s
e
m
increase in foreclosure proceedings, as five large mortgage servicers make progress
o
D
implementing the terms of the settlement with the State Attorneys General. In total,
house prices are expected to rise 5 percent this year and then increase at the more modest
average rate of about 2 percent in 2013 and 2014.
Fiscal Policy
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essentially unchanged in this forecast and
continue to imply that federal fiscal policy will exert a substantial drag on economic
growth in the medium term. In particular, we still assume that the temporary payroll tax
cut and the EUC program will expire at the beginning of next year, as scheduled under
current law. We also continue to assume that federal discretionary spending will be
restrained by the caps in the Budget Control Act and by reductions in defense spending as
overseas military operations are scaled back. However, the additional cuts scheduled to
take effect in January 2013 under the automatic sequestration stipulated by the Budget
Control Act are assumed to be replaced by more-gradual budget measures that achieve
the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal year 2021. We have also
maintained our assumption that most federal tax provisions set to expire at the end of this
year under current law will not, in fact, be allowed to expire, but instead will be
eventually extended.5 These provisions include the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and
2003, relief for most taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, and a number of other
non-stimulus-related tax reductions.
The legislative process for extending these tax cuts, along with replacing the
automatic spending sequestration with deficit reduction measures that are more gradual,
is likely to be contentious and protracted. Accordingly, the baseline projection envisions
that the process for reaching agreement will probably involve a number of short-term
5 In addition, we assume that the debt ceiling will be lifted in time to avert a default on the
federal debt.

u t extensions at the end of this year and in 2013. This legislative wrangling is assumed to
O
weigh on household and business confidence.
&
l
e
v
e We continue to expect fiscal policy in the aggregate will directly restrain the rate
D
n of real GDP growth (excluding multiplier effects) by ½ percentage point this year,
o
c
E 1 percentage point in 2013, and ¼ percentage point in 2014. Reflecting both the assumed
c
i
t fiscal policy tightening and an anticipated acceleration in tax revenues as the economic
s
e
m
recovery strengthens, the budget deficit is projected to narrow from $1.1 trillion
o
D
(7¼ percent of GDP) in the current fiscal year to about $700 billion (4 percent of GDP) in
fiscal 2014.
Foreign Activity and the Dollar
We estimate that foreign real GDP growth slowed to 2¼ percent in the second
quarter, reflecting a deceleration in emerging market economies as well as a contraction
in Europe. We continue to expect rapid fiscal consolidation and elevated financial
stresses to be a major drag on real GDP growth in Europe in the near term, while activity
elsewhere should expand at a moderate pace. As in the June Tealbook, we anticipate that
financial tensions related to Europe will increase in the near term before starting to ease
next year. This easing, in conjunction with supportive monetary conditions, should pave
the way for a gradual pickup in foreign GDP growth from 2¼ percent in the second half
of this year to 3¼ percent in 2014. Of course, this outlook remains quite uncertain as
European policymakers still must overcome major hurdles in order to address their fiscal
and banking-sector vulnerabilities.
Since the June Tealbook, the dollar is about unchanged, on net, as it appreciated
against the euro but depreciated against most other currencies. We expect the dollar to
appreciate into the fourth quarter of 2012, similar to our projection in the June Tealbook
and in line with our assumption that the euro-area crisis is likely to worsen in the near
term. Thereafter, as financial stresses begin to ease, the dollar is projected to depreciate
at about a 3½ percent annual rate through the end of 2014.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
The spot price of Brent crude oil closed at $104 per barrel on July 23, up about
$8 since the time of the June Tealbook.6 The increase follows a sharp decline from late
6 The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed on July 23 at $89 per barrel,
about $6 higher than at the time of the June Tealbook.

March through late June that was driven largely by greater pessimism regarding global u t
O
economic growth and an easing of concerns regarding Iran. The subsequent rebound in
&
crude oil prices appears to reflect a resurgence in tensions with Iran and increased e l
v
e
violence in the Middle East. Brent futures prices have also moved higher, although by D
n
less than the spot price, causing the Brent futures curve to become more steeply o
c
E
downward sloping. Our current projection calls for the price of imported oil to gradually
c
i
t
decline from $97 per barrel in the current quarter—a level that is over $8 higher than in s
e
m
the previous projection—to $85 per barrel at the end of 2014, slightly below the June o
D
Tealbook.
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices is about unchanged from the time of
the June Tealbook, as a jump in food prices about offset declining prices for industrial
metals. Poor growing conditions in the United States and overseas, and consequent
downward revisions to production forecasts, have pushed up prices for most field crops,
with corn and soybean prices reaching record highs. In contrast, metals prices have
fallen, on net, likely reflecting concerns over global growth. For the projection period,
we expect nonfuel commodity prices to decline slightly.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
Economic activity now appears to have increased at an even more modest pace
during the first half of this year than we had anticipated in June, and the available
indicators for the second half are a little less encouraging as well. After folding in
generally softer spending data, primarily for consumption expenditures and defense
outlays, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the
second quarter, compared with the 1½ percent increase we had forecast previously. The
data for household spending, along with news from the employment report, capital goods
orders, and the downbeat tone of the handful of indicators we have for July, led us to
shave our projection for GDP growth in the second half by a little more than
¼ percentage point, to an average annual rate of about 1½ percent.
The Labor Market
After improving significantly during the late fall and winter, conditions in the
labor market have shown little to no net change over the past several months, with private
payrolls posting mediocre gains and the unemployment rate leveling out. Compared with
the June Tealbook, the incoming labor market news has been just a little below our
expectations.

Private employment rose about 90,000 per month in the second quarter, well u t
O
below the average gains of 225,000 per month in the first quarter. While we estimate that
&
some of this deceleration can be explained by a payback from the warm winter weather e l
v
e
and distortions to seasonal adjustment related to the sharp employment declines in late D
n
2008 and early 2009, we also discern a genuine weakening in labor market conditions: o
c
E
Abstracting from weather and seasonal influences as well as noise in the data, the
c
i
t
underlying pace of private payroll gains appears to have slowed from about 195,000 per s
e
m
month in the first quarter to about 130,000 per month in the second quarter. Meanwhile, o
D
the unemployment rate remained at 8.2 percent in June, and initial claims for
unemployment insurance have continued to be in a range consistent with only modest job
gains in coming months.
Taken together, the recent data on the labor market and our less favorable outlook
for the broader economy have led us to weaken slightly our near-term employment
forecast. We now expect the pace of private employment gains to average about 110,000
per month over the rest of the year, a little lower than our projection in the June
Tealbook. We expect the unemployment rate to tick up to 8.3 percent in the second half
of the year, just a bit higher than in our previous projection.
The Industrial Sector
Manufacturing production increased at an annual rate of only 1½ percent in the
second quarter, a dramatic step-down from the nearly 10 percent pace registered in the
first quarter. Unusually warm weather this winter and the resolution of motor vehicle
supply chain disruptions related to last year’s natural disasters in Japan and Thailand
likely contributed to the earlier surge and subsequent pullback in factory
production. Nonetheless, we think that the bulk of the slowdown represents an actual
weakening of conditions in the manufacturing sector and cannot be attributed to these
special factors. (For a discussion on labor market conditions in manufacturing, see the
box “Skilled Labor Shortages in the Manufacturing Sector.”)
Furthermore, nearly all of the indicators of manufacturing activity in the near term
have weakened in recent months. In particular, both the ISM new orders index and the
average of the indexes from the regional surveys slipped below 50 in June, and the
available surveys for July remain downbeat. As a result, we have revised down our near-
term projection for factory output, and we now expect manufacturing production to

Skilled Labor Shortages in the Manufacturing Sector
&
l
e
v
e Anecdotal reports suggest that some firms have been struggling to find sufficient numbers of
D
skilled workers. For instance, over the past year, Beige Books have repeatedly cited this concern;
n
o the June edition mentioned “widespread reports that firms continued to face difficulty finding
c
E highly trained or skilled workers—especially in information technology, engineering, and
c
i manufacturing fields” (page vii). Here we focus on the manufacturing sector. Although
t
s
e manufacturing accounts for only around 11 percent of private employment, the reports of labor
m
o shortages are often specific to this sector.1 Indeed, earlier this year, inquiries conducted by the
D
Philadelphia and New York Federal Reserve Banks suggested that skilled labor shortages were a
significant factor restraining hiring in the manufacturing sector—though slow expected growth of
sales and a desire to keep costs low were the most important reasons cited.2
Further information about the extent of skilled labor shortages in manufacturing—and,
importantly, how they have changed over time—can be seen in data from the Census Bureau’s
Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QSPC). The QSPC, which is jointly funded by the Federal
Reserve Board and the Department of Defense, provides the data used to benchmark the Federal
Reserve Board’s measures of manufacturing capacity. The survey asks roughly 7,500 plant
managers about their plants’ actual production and total sustainable productive capacities, and,
when applicable, the reasons that plants are operating at less than capacity.
As shown in the figure and table below, “Insufficient supply of local labor force/skills” was cited as
a factor restraining production by more than 20 percent of respondents in the late 1990s and by
nearly 15 percent during the expansionary period leading up to the most recent recession.3 The
share of plant managers choosing this reason plummeted to less than 2 percent during the
1
For instance, the National Association of Manufacturers stated in its 2011 Skills Gap Report that skilled labor
shortages were a pressing problem within manufacturing, but noted that “[t]his problem is not new” (p. 1).
2
“Cannot find workers with required skills” was the third most frequently named factor in the case of New
York (40 percent of respondents) and fourth in the case of Philadelphia (28 percent). These figures are higher than
in similar inquiries conducted in early 2011; unfortunately, comparisons are not available for periods before the most
recent recession, when the labor market was tighter.
3
The responses are weighted by plant size; unweighted results are similar.

recession. The share reporting that skills shortages were a restraint on production has moved up e
v
e
somewhat since then: As of the first quarter of this year, the proportion had risen to 7½ percent. D
Nevertheless, this share remains below its historical average, and moreover, it is consistent with a n
o
regression‐based prediction using the unemployment rate and the manufacturing capacity c
E
utilization rate. Both historically and currently, the dominant reason cited by plant managers for c
i
t
operating at less than capacity has been “Insufficient orders” (the red line in the figure); this s
e
reason was chosen by 83 percent of respondents in the first quarter of this year and remains above m
o
its long‐run average.4 D
Even when the QSPC data are disaggregated to the level of major industries within the
manufacturing sector, they suggest that skilled labor shortages are not a major factor restraining
production. The figure below presents results for two industries that are frequently mentioned in
press reports as facing labor shortages: machinery and fabricated metals. Plant managers in these
industries historically have been significantly more likely than other managers to report that skilled
labor shortages are restraining production. However, even for these two industries, the share of
survey respondents in recent quarters who cited skilled labor shortages as a reason for operating
below capacity has remained well below the share before the recession.
All told, while some skilled labor shortages are being reported in the manufacturing sector, the
extent to which these shortages are restraining production appears about in line with the current
weakness in the labor market and the degree of slack in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore,
the finding that skilled labor shortages are not a significant and widespread restraint on production

In addition to “Insufficient orders” and “Insufficient supply of local labor force/skills,” the other choices are:
“Not most profitable to operate at capacity,” “Sufficient inventory of finished goods on hand,” “Insufficient supply
of materials,” “Equipment limitations,” “Seasonal operations,” “Lack of sufficient fuel or electrical energy,”
“Storage limitations,” “Logistics/transportation constraints,” “Strike or work stoppage,” and “Environmental
restrictions.” Respondents may choose as many factors as are applicable.

Household Spending e
D
n
After having risen at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter, real PCE is o
c
estimated to have increased only 1 percent last quarter, noticeably less than projected in E
c
i
the June Tealbook. If not for a rebound in spending on energy services following the s t
e
m
unusually mild winter, the slowdown would have been still more pronounced. To be
o
D
sure, a decline in outlays for motor vehicles, a volatile component of spending, was an
important part of the second-quarter deceleration, and we expect a rebound in this
category in the second half. Still, with consumer sentiment downbeat and the incoming
news on retail sales weaker than expected, we have marked down our projection of real
PCE growth about ¼ percentage point over the second half of this year, to an annual rate
of 2¼ percent.
We estimate that real disposable personal income (DPI) accelerated in the second
quarter to an annual rate of 2½ percent after having barely increased over the preceding
year. The sharp drop in consumer energy prices following their first-quarter increases
played an important role in last quarter’s acceleration. Declining energy prices and
ongoing growth in nominal income should continue to boost households’ purchasing
power in the second half. With weak consumer spending data and firming real income,
the personal saving rate, which had fallen to a surprisingly low level in the first quarter,
has edged up in recent months, a trend we expect to continue in the second half.
Housing activity appears to be on a gradual uptrend, albeit from a very depressed
level. Smoothing as best we can through the volatility associated with the unseasonably
warm weather last winter, single-family housing starts and permits look to have moved
up a little from their levels late last year. In addition, some signs indicate that housing
demand is slowly improving: Both new and existing home sales have edged up over the
past year, on balance, and—as was noted earlier—measures of house prices have turned
up since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, given the ongoing restraint on demand
from difficult credit conditions and uncertainty about employment and income prospects,
as well as the likelihood that the still-abundant stock of relatively inexpensive vacant
houses will continue to divert demand from new construction, we project that single-
family starts will increase only slightly over the rest of the year.

u t In contrast, construction activity in the multifamily sector has picked up more
O
rapidly than in the single-family sector in the past several years, likely in response to
&
e l rising rents and falling vacancy rates, as many of the factors restraining home purchases
v
e
D have increased demand for rental units. We expect these conditions to persist, and so we
n
o project that multifamily starts will continue to move up in coming months.

t Business Investment

m
After rising at a modest annual rate of 3½ percent in the first quarter, real business
o
D
spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to have risen at an annual rate of
nearly 7 percent in the second quarter. However, we view the second-quarter pace as
unlikely to be sustained: Over the past three months, new orders for capital goods have
declined noticeably and the backlog of unfilled orders has decelerated sharply.
Moreover, forward-looking indicators of business investment have also softened in recent
months, partly reflecting concerns about the situation in Europe. Notably, indexes from
various recent surveys of business conditions have dropped to low levels and analysts’
earnings expectations for capital goods producers have deteriorated. As a result, we have
trimmed our forecast for the increase in E&S spending over the second half of this year to
an annual rate of less than 3 percent, 2 percentage points less than in the June Tealbook.
Following a period of surprising strength through much of 2011, spending on
nonresidential construction (excluding drilling and mining) rose at a more moderate pace
in the first half of this year, a deceleration in line with the sector’s weak fundamentals.
Although there are hints of some easing in financing conditions for existing commercial
real estate, we anticipate that high vacancy rates, low commercial real estate prices, and
difficult financing conditions for new construction will continue to put downward
pressure on building activity for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, investment in the
drilling and mining sector appears to have turned down in the first half of 2012 following
the brisk increases seen in 2010 and 2011. This downturn is probably related to the
sizable decline in natural gas prices over the past year. Outlays for drilling and mining
structures are expected to edge up some, on balance, over the rest of the year as natural
gas prices have recently moved back up somewhat.
Firms in the nonfarm business sector appear to have accumulated inventories in
the first half of this year at a moderate pace, only a little above that in the fourth quarter
of last year. Available estimates from the staff’s flow-of-goods system, book-value
measures of the inventory-to-sales ratio, reports on dealer inventories of motor vehicles,

and surveys of inventory satisfaction and plans all indicate that overall inventory stocks u t
O
are fairly well aligned with sales. With producers thought to be apprehensive about the
&
sustainability of the recovery, we expect the pace of stockbuilding to rise slowly and to e l
v
e
contribute only modestly to real GDP growth over the rest of the year. D
n
o
c
Government E
c
i
We estimate that real federal purchases fell at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the s t

second quarter, a steeper decline than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook. In the
o
D
second half of the year, we anticipate that the downtrend in these expenditures will slow
to a 2½ percent rate—a pace we judge to be more in line with budget appropriations.
Purchases by state and local governments have also continued to contract. We estimate
that real state and local purchases fell at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter,
but we expect that these expenditures will only edge down in the second half, as the
declines in both the payrolls and construction spending of these governments moderate.
Taken together, federal, state, and local purchases are expected to subtract ½ percentage
point from the rate of real GDP growth this year.
Foreign Trade
Real exports of goods and services are estimated to have increased at an annual
rate of 4½ percent in the second quarter, supported by both moderate growth in emerging
market economies and previous dollar depreciation. Over the second half of this year, we
expect real export growth to move down to a 3¼ percent pace, as the dollar rises and the
positive effect of previous declines fades. Meanwhile, real imports are estimated to have
increased 3¼ percent in the second quarter of this year; this estimate is 1¼ percentage
points lower than in the June Tealbook, mainly due to a large downward revision to our
estimate of oil imports. Over the second half of 2012, we expect real import growth to
step up to an average pace of 4¾ percent, boosted by the rising dollar over the remainder
of this year. All told, net exports are now estimated to have been neutral for real GDP
growth in the second quarter, an upward revision of about ¼ percentage point relative to
the June Tealbook, but we anticipate that they will subtract about ½ percentage point
from real GDP growth in the second half of the year, roughly unchanged from the June
projection.
Prices and Wages

we continue to estimate that total PCE price inflation stepped down from an annual rate

of 2½ percent in the first quarter to around ¾ percent in the second quarter, largely u t
O
reflecting the sharp drop in energy prices in the spring. In the current quarter, we
&
anticipate that consumer prices will again rise at a ¾ percent pace, up somewhat from the e l
v
e
June Tealbook because the partial rebound in oil prices in recent weeks points to a less D
n
dramatic decline in gasoline prices. Later this year, a flattening in retail energy prices o
c
E
and a pickup in PCE food price inflation are expected to push total PCE inflation back up
c
i
t
to about 1½ percent. s
e
m
o
D
Lower-than-expected data on consumer food prices in May led us to revise down
our estimate for PCE food price inflation in the second quarter to an annual rate of just
¾ percent. However, grain prices rose rapidly in late June and early July as a wide swath
of the country was scorched by hot, dry weather, which cut the USDA’s projections of
crop yields considerably. Compared with its level at the time of the June Tealbook, a
weighted average of crop-related futures prices is currently about 25 percent higher; an
average of projected livestock prices also has increased, though by much less. Typically,
the immediate pass-through of farm commodity price increases into PCE food prices is
limited, and our third-quarter projection is only a little higher than in the June Tealbook.
However, we anticipate that the pass-through will pick up steam in the fourth quarter,
with retail food prices increasing at an annual rate of 3¼ percent, an upward revision of
about 1¾ percentage points from the June Tealbook. Still, given the relatively small
weight of food prices in overall inflation, this upward revision has only a minor effect on
total consumer price inflation.
Core PCE price inflation was boosted in the first quarter by a transitory jump in
the price increases of both core goods and services in January; since then, these prices
have risen at a more subdued pace, consistent with our estimate that the annual rate of
core price inflation was 1¾ percent in the second quarter. We expect core PCE inflation
to edge down further to an annual rate of 1½ percent over the second half of 2012, as core
goods prices decelerate in line with the slowing in import and commodity prices. The
slightly slower pace of core inflation in the second half is consistent with the recent
downturn in the price index for core intermediate materials, which fell at an annual rate
of 3 percent over the three months ending in June.
Regarding wages, following two quarters of being essentially flat, compensation
per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of
2 percent in the second quarter, close to our expectations in the June Tealbook. We

D
e THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
n
o
c Although our near-term outlook has softened, our medium-term projection for
E
c GDP growth has changed little since the June Tealbook, in large part because we have
i
t
s
e taken on board the extension of the MEP. After increasing 1½ percent this year, real
m
o
D GDP is projected to rise 2 percent next year and 3¼ percent in 2014. As before, the
modest acceleration in real GDP is supported by further expected improvements in
financial conditions, an eventual easing of the financial crisis in Europe, and rising
household and business confidence in the durability of the recovery. While the tightening
of fiscal policy is anticipated to impose a substantial drag on economic growth in 2013,
these effects are expected to ease considerably in 2014. A number of other factors also
still weigh on the outlook, including tight credit in some markets, an overhang of vacant
homes restraining housing activity, and subdued foreign demand. As a result, the
projected recovery remains subpar, and we anticipate that the jobless rate will not drop
below 8 percent until 2014—when real GDP finally starts to grow materially faster than
potential.
Part of the fiscal restraint in our projection for real GDP growth shows up directly
as declines in government purchases. As in our previous projection, real federal
purchases are anticipated to drop more than 4 percent in both 2013 and 2014, reflecting
the expected effects of the Budget Control Act and a further drawdown of overseas
military operations. The recovery in the purchases of state and local governments is
projected to be quite slow, as fiscal conditions in the sector are likely to remain tight for
some time, partly reflecting the relatively slow pace of the broader economic recovery.
Although state tax revenues have been rising at a reasonable rate, local taxes, which are
dominated by property taxes, have been stagnant, and the stimulus-related federal grants
have essentially ended. As a consequence, real state and local purchases are expected to
just edge up in 2013 and to rise at only a tepid pace in 2014.
The large fiscal drag we expect next year also shows through indirectly in other
categories of aggregate spending. In particular, the anticipated expiration of the
temporary payroll tax cut and the EUC program at the end of this year impart significant
restraint on consumer spending next year. Nonetheless, real PCE growth is expected to
expand 2¼ percent next year, supported by, among other factors, a rebound in household

k
o
o
l
confidence that is expected to accompany the easing in financial conditions once the u t
O
situation in Europe begins to resolve and the threat of a domestic fiscal calamity recedes.
&
In 2014, we project that consumer spending will accelerate further, as fiscal restraint e l
v
e
ebbs, employment prospects improve, and household net worth continues to rise. D
n
o
c
Real exports are projected to increase a subdued 3¾ percent next year, held back E
c
i
by weak demand from the advanced foreign economies—notably Europe—before t
s
e
m
stepping up to a 5½ percent pace in 2014, boosted by increasing foreign growth and a
o
D
depreciating dollar. Meanwhile, real imports are expected to rise at an average pace of
4½ percent in 2013 and 2014. Overall, net trade is expected to make a small negative
contribution to growth in 2013 and then be a neutral factor in 2014, about the same as in
the previous projection.
With sluggish demand emanating from the government, consumer, and foreign
sectors, businesses likely see little reason to expand capacity significantly. Despite the
fact that large firms have ample cash on hand, we project that the business sector as a
whole will remain cautious until the recovery is clearly on a stronger footing. We
therefore expect expenditures on E&S to strengthen only gradually over the medium
term, to an average annual rate of 5¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, similar to our previous
projection. These same factors, along with persistently high vacancy rates, are
restraining investment in structures (other than drilling and mining). As a result, we still
foresee small declines through next year and only small gains in 2014. In contrast,
investment in drilling and mining is expected to turn back up over the medium term
following this year’s retreat, as the continued deployment of horizontal drilling
techniques should keep spending growth in this sector at respectable rates.
We continue to expect the recovery in housing construction to be slow.
Ordinarily, historically low mortgage rates would be expected to provide a substantial
boost to home purchases and to new construction over the medium term. However, this
impetus is likely to continue to be markedly attenuated by ongoing difficulties for many
households in accessing mortgage credit and by persistent uncertainty about job and
income prospects. In addition, the flow of homes from foreclosure into the resale market
is expected to remain substantial, keeping the stock of vacant houses at a high level and
thus limiting the demand for new construction. Accordingly, we project single-family
housing starts to move up only gradually over the forecast period to a little over 650,000

Potential GDP and the NAIRU c

We have made no changes to our estimates of aggregate supply in this projection. i
t
s
e
We continue to assume that potential GDP will increase roughly 2 percent through 2014, m
o
and we have retained our assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent over that D
period.7
The Labor Market
Although we expect the pace of private employment growth to rebound some
from the slow pace in the second and third quarters, private job gains are anticipated to
remain subdued, averaging only about 120,000 per month in 2013, a bit less than in our
June forecast. With this subpar rate of job creation, it is only the expiration of the EUC
program—and the accompanying exit of those individuals who remained in the labor
force to maintain eligibility for benefits—that induces the unemployment rate to drift
down at all, from 8¼ percent currently to 8 percent by the end of 2013. In 2014, stronger
growth in aggregate demand pushes up job gains to 200,000 per month and reduces the
unemployment rate to 7¾ percent by the end of that year, roughly the same level as in the
June Tealbook.
Resource Utilization
As in our previous projection, labor market slack remains substantial throughout
our medium-term forecast, with the unemployment rate still 1¾ percentage points above
our estimate of the NAIRU at the end of 2014. Likewise, our estimate of the output gap
only narrows materially in 2014, ending the projection at negative 3½ percent.
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in
labor input, our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of
plants to produce with the equipment that is in place and ready to operate; it does not take
account of the potential workforce, either inside the industrial sector or outside of it.
7 We estimate that the boost to the “effective” NAIRU from the emergency and extended
unemployment insurance programs has diminished and is worth only about ¼ percentage point at present.
The gap between the two measures is expected to close completely next year as these programs are fully
wound down.

From the end of 2007 through 2010, factory capacity plunged about 6 percent. As a u t
O
result, resource utilization in the industrial sector is currently higher than in the broader
&
economy; indeed, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector in June was e l
v
e
77.7 percent, only about 1 percentage point below its long-run average rate. Our D
n
projection calls for the factory operating rate to rise gradually over the projection period, o
c
E
reaching its long-run average by the end of 2014 despite a still-sizable GDP gap.

Prices and Compensation

We expect inflation to remain low and steady over the medium term. The
stability of inflation expectations in recent years, which we expect to continue in the
projection period, is one important factor underpinning our inflation trajectory. Readings
on longer-term inflation expectations have remained little changed since the previous
Tealbook. The median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectation from the Michigan
survey stood at 2.8 percent in July, well within the narrow range seen over the last few
years. The TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation for the next 5 years is about
unchanged since the Tealbook, and the corresponding measure for 5-to-10 years ahead is
down about 20 basis points.
Import prices are another factor that we expect to contribute to continued low
inflation, especially in the second half of this year when the lagged effects of a rising
dollar and previous declines in commodity prices are expected to lead to a decline in core
import prices. In 2013 and 2014, core import price inflation is expected to rise to an
annual rate of just 1¼ percent, consistent with our projection for modest dollar
depreciation and a relatively flat trajectory for commodity prices.
These factors, together with the considerable underutilization in labor and product
markets expected over the medium term, lead us to project core inflation rates of
1.5 percent in the second half of 2012 and 1.6 percent in both 2013 and 2014. After
posting sizable declines in the near term, retail energy prices are anticipated to continue
to edge lower over the next couple of years, consistent with our assumed path for crude
oil prices. For that reason, headline inflation is expected to run a little below core
inflation in both 2013 and 2014 despite modest upward pressure from food prices, as the
recent run-up in farm commodity prices passes through to retail prices late this year and
early next year. With these low rates of consumer price inflation and the wide margin of
slack in the labor market, nonfarm hourly compensation and the employment cost index
are each projected to rise less than 3 percent in both 2013 and 2014.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK u t
O
&
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and
l
e
v
our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors. e
D
The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key assumptions: n
o
c
E
c
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent, consistent with i
t
s
e
the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 2012 meeting. The m
o
federal funds rate continues to be set according to the estimated outcome- D
based rule.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates over the 2014–17 period. However, as
the time of portfolio normalization draws nearer, this downward pressure
wanes, and that waning contributes to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield.
Beyond 2017, the process of normalization should be essentially completed.
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal
levels, and banks further ease their lending standards.
 The federal government budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) narrows
somewhat further, from 4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3¾ percent of GDP in
2017, as the boost to tax receipts from the expanding economy slightly
outpaces gains in federal spending. Meanwhile, federal debt held by the
public remains around 75 percent of GDP. After 2017, the deficit widens
again and the ratio of federal debt to GDP begins to increase because of fast-
rising transfer payments for retirement and health-care programs.
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2¼ percent per year
from 2014 to 2017. The pace of dollar depreciation tapers off thereafter. The
price of crude oil is roughly flat from 2014 to 2016 and then holds steady in
real terms. Foreign real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 3½ percent in
2015 through 2017 and then gradually edges down to a 3 percent pace by late
in the decade.
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to
5¼ percent at the end of 2017 as conditions in the labor market continue to
improve, and it remains at 5¼ percent in the long run. Potential GDP

k
o
o
l
u t increases at an average annual rate of around 2½ percent from 2015 through
O
the end of the decade.
&
l
e
v
e The economy is projected to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level,
D
n the unemployment rate above the assumed NAIRU, and inflation lower than the long-run
o
c
E objective of the Committee. In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in
c
t i household and business confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and more-supportive
s
e
m financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of about 3½ percent
o
D from 2015 through 2017. With real GDP expanding at a pace faster than the growth rate
of potential output, labor market conditions improve further, and the unemployment rate
ends 2017 at about 6 percent. With long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain
well anchored and the margin of slack in labor and product markets diminishing,
consumer price inflation edges up gradually but is still only 1¾ percent in 2017. Late in
the decade, the economy converges to an unemployment rate near the long-run NAIRU,
an inflation rate at the Committee’s longer-term objective, and a nominal federal funds
rate of 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
We estimate that foreign GDP growth moderated to an annual rate of 2¼ percent
in the second quarter, as activity decelerated in emerging market economies (EMEs) and
contracted in Europe. In the near term, fiscal retrenchment and financial stresses are
expected to remain a substantial drag on GDP growth in Europe, while activity elsewhere
should expand at a moderate pace. We assume that euro-area leaders take actions
sufficient to allow financial tensions related to the euro-area crisis to start to ease by next
year. This reduction in financial stresses, in conjunction with supportive monetary policy

o
around the world, should pave the way for a pickup in foreign GDP growth from o
l
t
u
2¼ percent in the second half of 2012 to 3¼ percent by 2014. Compared with the June O
Tealbook, this outlook is just a bit weaker in the current quarter and little changed &
l
e
thereafter. v
e
D
n
Despite a flurry of announcements by European policymakers, financial stresses o
c
E
in Europe have worsened since the June Tealbook. Market participants reacted positively l
’
t
n
to a cut in policy rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) and welcomed pledges by I
European leaders to establish a single supervisory mechanism for banks and to allow the
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to recapitalize banks directly. However, this
positive response was short lived, as investors came to recognize that European
policymakers must still overcome major hurdles to address their fiscal- and banking-
sector vulnerabilities. Sovereign spreads climbed appreciably in Italy and Spain, and
European bank stocks plunged. Accordingly, we continue to expect financial conditions
in Europe to deteriorate further over the course of this year until policymakers are forced
to take more-decisive policy actions, eventually leading to gradual financial and
economic improvement. However, as discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section, the
possibility of more-dire outcomes remains significant.
Foreign inflation slowed from 2.6 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter to
an estimated 2 percent pace in the second quarter, primarily reflecting declines in retail
energy prices. Inflation is expected to pick up in the current quarter, as oil prices have
firmed of late and agricultural commodity prices have jumped because of droughts in
North America and elsewhere. With commodity prices projected to level off over the
next couple of years and economic slack widening slightly, we continue to expect foreign
inflation to remain contained through the forecast period.

In response to the slowing in output growth and inflation over the first half of the
year, many central banks eased the stance of monetary policy during the intermeeting
period. Notably, the ECB, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and the Central Bank of
Brazil cut their policy rates, while the Bank of England (BOE) expanded its quantitative
easing program and launched a new facility to support lending to the nonfinancial sector.
We expect foreign central banks to take further accommodative actions in coming
quarters.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
k Recent indicators suggest that GDP growth in advanced foreign economies
o
o
t l (AFEs) slowed from 1.5 percent in the first quarter to around ¾ percent in the second
u
O
quarter, a little weaker than in the June Tealbook, as U.K. GDP contracted much more
&
l sharply than anticipated. We expect AFE growth to remain near that anemic pace in the
e
v
e second half of this year. Despite agreement among European leaders to move forward on
D
n a number of fronts to address the crisis, we assume that financial tensions in the euro area
o
c
E will increase in coming months, leading to a deepening of the euro-area recession. Partly
l
’
t
n reflecting spillovers from the euro-area downturn, output growth in the other major AFEs
I
should remain modest. As the euro-area recession abates and global economic conditions
slowly improve, GDP growth in the AFEs should pick up to 1¼ percent in 2013 and
reach 2 percent in 2014, about unchanged from the June Tealbook.
Headline inflation in the AFEs stepped down from 2.2 percent in the first quarter
to less than ¾ percent in the second quarter. This decline is ¾ percentage point greater
than we had anticipated, mostly reflecting a surprisingly large fall in retail energy prices
in Canada. AFE inflation should average 1¼ percent through the end of 2013 before
edging up to 1½ percent in 2014. Recent increases in energy prices prompted us to raise
our inflation forecast a little for the second half of this year relative to the June Tealbook.
Our projection for inflation is mostly unchanged thereafter. Amid subdued inflation
prospects and sizable output gaps, we expect AFE central banks to ease further in the
second half of this year.
Euro Area
Our projection for economic activity in the euro area is little changed relative to
the June Tealbook. Recent indicators suggest that euro-area real GDP contracted at an
annual rate of about 1 percent in the second quarter. Industrial production and retail sales
remain well below their first-quarter levels despite an increase in May, and the
Page 36 of 122

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
unemployment rate reached a record-high 11.1 percent in May. In June, confidence
indicators edged down and the composite PMI stayed firmly in contractionary territory;
flash estimates for July point to continued weakness in the current quarter. We expect
GDP to fall at a 1½ percent rate in the second half of the year and ¼ percent in 2013
before increasing only 1 percent in 2014.
Euro-area inflation moderated to an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second
quarter from 2.6 percent in the first quarter, largely as a result of earlier declines in
energy prices. We expect inflation to remain around 2 percent in the second half of this
year—a little higher than in the June Tealbook—reflecting recent euro depreciation and
k
higher energy prices. Thereafter, we project that inflation will edge down to 1½ percent o
o
l
t
in 2013 and 2014. At its July 5 meeting, the ECB cut its benchmark policy rate to u
O
0.75 percent and reduced the rate on its overnight deposit facility to zero. (We examine &
l
the effect of the deposit rate cut on money market functioning in the box “The Effects of e
v
e
the European Central Bank’s Deposit Rate Cut” in the Financial Developments section.) D
n
We expect the ECB to lower its benchmark policy rate to 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter o
c
E
and to continue to provide significant liquidity to banks.
l
’
t
n
I
European leaders announced new plans to address the crisis at their June 28–29
summit, including some steps toward a banking union. During the intermeeting period,
policymakers also approved a loan package of up to €100 billion to shore up the Spanish
banking sector and allowed Spain more time to bring its deficit down. (For further
details, see the box “Recent Developments in the Euro Area.”) Investor enthusiasm was
short lived, however, as it became clear that many of the agreed-upon measures still face
daunting technical, legal, and political challenges. Moreover, progress on the
strengthening of Europe’s financial rescue facilities has flagged, with German approval
of the ESM on hold pending a ruling by the German Constitutional Court scheduled for
mid-September. Thus, Europe still lacks a firewall sufficient to protect vulnerable
countries from possible adverse shocks, such as a breakdown of negotiations between the
newly elected Greek government and its official creditors over a resumption of EU–IMF
financing. Amid these ongoing uncertainties, we expect a further deterioration in
financial conditions, which will eventually force policymakers to take actions aggressive
enough to stabilize the situation and ultimately restore investor confidence.

Recent Developments in the Euro Area
Over the intermeeting period, euro‐area leaders announced several measures
designed to increase regional financial integration and enhance support for
vulnerable economies, particularly Spain. Despite these announcements,
financial stresses in the euro area have worsened (see the figures on the
following page), as critical details of the plans have yet to be worked out,
implementation is expected to be time consuming and contentious, and further
policy measures will likely be needed.
At their June 28–29 summit, European leaders announced plans for deeper
k
o economic and financial integration. First, they agreed to establish a single bank
o
l supervisory mechanism involving the ECB. The European Commission intends to
t
u
present specific proposals in September, and European leaders plan to consider
O
them by the end of the year. Second, leaders agreed that when such a
&
supervisory mechanism is established, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
l
e
v will be able to directly recapitalize banks rather than channel assistance through
e
D governments. These steps are in line with a proposal by a few key regional
n officials for the euro area to move toward a banking union (including a pan‐
o
c European approach to deposit insurance and bank resolution) and a fiscal union
E
l (including issuance of common debt and greater constraints on national fiscal
’
t
n policies). Although European leaders did not endorse this proposal, they invited
I
its authors to further develop it and to present another report in October.
In addition, euro‐area policymakers announced measures to assist vulnerable
economies. They agreed to extend from 2013 to 2014 the deadline for Spain to
bring its fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP. They also worked out key terms of
Spain’s financial assistance package (to fund the recapitalization of its banks),
which include plans for comprehensive assessments of bank capital needs,
transfers of impaired bank assets to an external asset management company,
and the imposition of losses on shareholders and some junior creditors of banks.
The loans provided to Spain in the package will not have explicit seniority vis‐à‐vis
private claims and thus may avoid further constraining Spain’s ability to issue
new debt. Euro‐area policymakers also announced that the government of
Cyprus had formally requested financial assistance from euro‐area governments
and the IMF. Much of this assistance will likely be devoted to the recapitalization
and restructuring of Cypriot banks, which are heavily exposed to Greece. Finally,
euro‐area member states agreed to a €120 billion (1.3 percent of euro‐area GDP)
growth package, which includes an increase in the capital of the European
Investment Bank, reallocation of EU funds toward growth‐enhancing projects,
and credit enhancements for infrastructure bonds.
Although these measures are positive developments, critical details remain
unsettled and implementation risks are substantial. It remains unclear how
supervisory authority will be allocated between the ECB—the presumptive
pan‐European supervisor—and national financial supervisors. Further, following
the summit, statements by some policymakers created confusion as to whether
Page 38 of 122

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
direct recapitalization by the ESM would actually absolve individual sovereigns of
the cost of recapitalizing banks in their jurisdictions. As a related matter, some
market participants believed that, once the single supervisory mechanism and
the ESM’s authority to directly recapitalize banks were both in place, the loans to
Spain’s government to finance recapitalization would be replaced by direct
equity stakes in its banks. However, subsequent statements by euro‐area
policymakers have raised doubts regarding these expectations.
An additional concern is that the process of strengthening the financial
backstops for vulnerable governments has met with delays. In particular, the
establishment of the ESM, which is intended to supplement and supplant the
k
resources of the temporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), is falling o
o
behind schedule. The original target of July will not be met, as legal challenges l
t
u
will delay Germany’s ratification of the ESM treaty until mid‐September or later. O
As a result, with claims on EFSF resources growing (including financial assistance &
for Spanish banks and Cyprus), the financial backstops will remain inadequate in l
e
the near term for a wide range of adverse scenarios. v
e
D
Greece remains a potential trigger of such scenarios. After prevailing over the n
o
far‐left anti‐bailout party, SYRIZA, in national parliamentary elections on June 17, c
E
the center‐right New Democracy party formed a pro‐bailout coalition with a l
’
t
strong parliamentary majority. The new coalition government is now n
I
cooperating with its official creditors in an effort to keep Greece in the euro area.
However, Greece’s adjustment program is substantially off track, and the Greek
government cannot receive additional program funds until it agrees with its
creditors on a strategy to restore credibility. Such a strategy will likely require
very unpopular policy commitments by the Greek government (including
additional fiscal austerity measures worth at least 5 percent of GDP). In addition,
Greece’s creditors will likely have to commit additional financing, debt relief, or
both. Negotiations are likely to be difficult, and the timing is tight. About
€3 billion of Greek government bonds held primarily by the Eurosystem will
mature on August 20. Even if a makeshift solution to this immediate problem is
found, Greece’s official creditors will likely have to decide by September whether
to augment or to suspend Greece’s program.

United Kingdom
The U.K. economy shrank 2.8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter
according to the preliminary estimate, marking the third consecutive quarterly decline.
This estimate is substantially lower than in the June Tealbook owing in part to a
surprisingly sharp drop in construction. The contraction in GDP was exacerbated by a
special holiday to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Although the Summer
Olympics in London should temporarily boost activity in the third quarter, low
confidence, aggressive fiscal consolidation, and negative spillovers from the euro area are
expected to weigh on the underlying pace of economic activity. After contracting
k ¼ percent in 2012, economic activity should rise at a pace of 1¾ percent in 2013 and
o
o
l 2½ percent in 2014, supported by accommodative monetary policy and the diminution of
t
u
O financial stresses in Europe.
&
l
e
v U.K. inflation slowed to 1 percent in the second quarter from 2.1 percent in the
e
D
first quarter amid ample spare capacity and weak wage growth. We expect these factors
n
o
c to keep inflation just below 1¾ percent on average in 2013 and 2014. With output falling
E
’ l and inflation moderating, the BOE announced a £50 billion expansion of its quantitative
t
n
I easing program to £375 billion (almost 25 percent of GDP). In addition, the BOE
released details of a new Funding for Lending Scheme that will provide banks with long-
term funds at below-market rates to encourage them to lend to the nonfinancial sector.
(See the box “The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme” in the Financial
Developments section.)
Japan
The outlook for Japan is little changed relative to the June Tealbook. We estimate
that real GDP growth slowed from 4.7 percent in the first quarter to 2¼ percent in the
second quarter, primarily reflecting reduced support from fiscal stimulus measures. In
addition, recent data point to reduced momentum, with the composite PMI falling into
contractionary territory in June. Accordingly, we expect GDP growth to slow to a
modest ¾ percent pace in the second half of the year. As the global recovery gradually
gains momentum, we forecast GDP growth to pick up to 1 percent in 2013 and to nearly
1½ percent in 2014.
We estimate that Japanese inflation turned negative again last quarter. Consumer
prices should continue to decline at a slow pace through the end of 2013 before rising
1 percent in 2014 because of a planned 3 percentage point hike in the consumption tax.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
Earlier this month, the Bank of Japan slightly altered the composition of its Asset
Purchase Program but left its size unchanged. Amid ample resource slack and below-
target inflation, we continue to anticipate a further easing of monetary policy going
forward.
Canada
We estimate that real GDP grew 2 percent in the second quarter, the same rate as
in the first quarter. Recent data are consistent with our view that the Canadian economy
will continue to expand at a moderate pace in the near term. In June, the manufacturing
PMI ticked up to a solid 54.8 and employment edged up following outsized gains in the
k
o
spring. The latest Business Outlook Survey by the Bank of Canada (BOC) indicates that o
l
t
businesses have remained optimistic about sales, investment, and hiring over the coming u
O
year. As in the June Tealbook, we project that Canadian GDP will continue to expand at &
l
e
a 2 percent pace through the end of 2013 and then accelerate to a 2½ percent rate in 2014 v
e
D
as global GDP growth rises.
n
o
c
E
Consumer price inflation fell to zero in the second quarter, 1¾ percentage points
l
’
t
below our projection in June, as Canadian retail energy prices fell sharply. With retail n
I
energy prices having bottomed out, we expect inflation to rebound to 1¾ percent in the
second half of 2012 and stay close to that pace thereafter. With low inflation and with
global headwinds restraining Canadian GDP growth, we continue to expect the BOC to
keep its target for the overnight rate at 1 percent until the second quarter of 2014.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
We estimate that GDP growth in the EMEs slowed to 4 percent in the second
quarter, down from 5.2 percent in the first quarter. As expected, activity decelerated in
most countries, reflecting in part the passing of factors that had boosted output in the first
quarter, notably the bounceback from last year’s flooding in Thailand. However, the tone
of recent data was somewhat weaker than anticipated. For China, although second-
quarter real GDP growth came in as expected, the first-quarter reading was revised down
significantly. Accordingly, and consistent with the lower path for U.S. GDP growth, we
marked down EME growth a touch in the near term.
The outlook for activity in the EMEs further out is little changed. After holding at
a bit below trend for the next several quarters, output growth should edge up to about
4½ percent by 2014, as economic activity in the advanced economies firms and as
Page 41 of 122

--- Page 45 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
policymakers in the EMEs pursue more-accommodative policies. A significant
deterioration of the situation in Europe and a sharp slowing of the U.S. economy are key
downside risks to EME growth. In addition, we remain attentive to the risk of a sharp
slowdown in China, perhaps triggered by a collapse in the property market. (See the
scenario “Hard Landing in China” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.)
Headline inflation in the EMEs remained at 3 percent in the second quarter, with
declines in most countries largely offset by a nearly 20 percent spike in inflation in India.
We project EME inflation to hold near 3 percent before picking up to 3¼ percent by the
end of the forecast period, as GDP growth strengthens. This outlook is similar to that in
k
o
the June Tealbook. With inflation and economic growth moderating, some countries,
o
l
t
u including Brazil, China, and Korea, have recently loosened monetary policy.
O
&
l
e China
v
e
D Real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the second quarter, up
n
o from a downwardly revised pace of 6.6 percent in the first quarter. Data were weak
c
E
across all sectors of economic activity in April. However, retail sales, investment, and
l
’
t
n
I bank lending accelerated late in the quarter, partly in response to policy easing,
suggesting a stabilization of domestic demand growth after several months of softening.
China’s trade surplus widened in the second quarter, reflecting a small increase in exports
and a decline in imports. For the second half of this year, we see Chinese real GDP
growth remaining relatively subdued by historical standards at 7¾ percent. Output
growth should then gradually strengthen to a rate of 8¼ percent by the end of 2014,
reflecting policy stimulus and an improvement in global demand. Nonetheless, a hard
landing in China remains a nonnegligible risk.
Chinese consumer price inflation fell sharply in June, reflecting a large drop in
domestic food prices following a run-up earlier in the year. For the second quarter as
whole, inflation was 2½ percent at an annual rate. The drop in food prices led us to lower
our estimate of current-quarter inflation ½ percentage point, to 1¾ percent. With food
price inflation expected to normalize, headline inflation is projected to be 2½ percent in
the fourth quarter before edging up to 3 percent by 2014 as economic activity accelerates
and wage growth remains strong. Amid contained inflation and concern about GDP
growth, the PBOC cut banks’ one-year lending and deposit rates in early July to 6 percent
and 3 percent, respectively, the second cut in these rates in the past two months. We
assume additional monetary and fiscal accommodation in the coming quarters.

Other Emerging Asia
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, data suggest that GDP growth slowed from
5.5 percent in the first quarter to 3½ percent in the second quarter. We had anticipated
that economic activity in the region would moderate after the rebound from the
widespread supply disruptions following last year’s floods in Thailand. However, the
incoming data have been weaker than we had expected. In Singapore, the advance
release indicates that real GDP fell unexpectedly in the second quarter. For other
economies in the region, indicators such as industrial production, PMIs, and exports were
soft. These data and the lower path of U.S. output growth in the near term led us to mark
down a bit our forecast for the region in the second half of this year to 4 percent.
k
o
Thereafter, the outlook is unchanged, with growth averaging 4¼ percent in 2013 and o
l
t
u
4½ percent in 2014. O
&
l
e
We estimate that inflation in the region increased to an annual rate of 4¼ percent v
e
D
in the second quarter, largely driven by an outsized rise in inflation in India, where a
n
recent sharp depreciation of the rupee passed through to consumer prices. We expect o
c
E
inflation to moderate in coming quarters to about 3 percent and then to stay near that rate l
’
t
n
for the remainder of the forecast period. In Korea, with the balance of concerns shifting I
from inflation to output growth, the central bank lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points
to 3 percent.
Latin America
In Mexico, recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth slowed to 2¾ percent
in the second quarter, down from a robust 5.3 percent in the first quarter. The
manufacturing PMI in the second quarter stood below its first-quarter average, and retail
sales, exports, and industrial production through May also pointed to a deceleration of
activity. These data, along with downward revisions to U.S. manufacturing production,
led us to mark down Mexican GDP growth in the second quarter by ¼ percentage point.
GDP growth is projected to increase slightly to about 3 percent over the remainder of the
forecast period.
For South America, real GDP growth is estimated to have dropped from
3.2 percent in the first quarter to 2½ percent in the second quarter, largely reflecting a
sharp deceleration of economic activity in Venezuela. We project that growth in the
region will rise to nearly 4 percent by the end of 2014. In Brazil, favorable data on
consumption and an anticipated rebound in agricultural output (which had suffered a
Page 43 of 122

--- Page 47 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
large weather-related contraction in the first quarter) suggest that GDP growth picked up
to 2 percent in the second quarter from below 1 percent in the first quarter. This rebound
is a bit smaller than estimated in the June Tealbook, as recent data on industrial
production and exports have been disappointing. We expect Brazilian growth to rise to
about 4 percent by the end of 2014, supported by a firming of economic activity in the
advanced economies and accommodative macroeconomic policies domestically. The
Brazilian central bank cut the Selic rate by 50 basis points to a historic low of 8 percent,
bringing the cumulative policy rate reduction since last August to 450 basis points. In
addition, Brazilian authorities announced another round of fiscal stimulus in late June.
k
o
Mexican inflation declined sharply to 2½ percent in the second quarter because of
o
l
t
u the implementation of electricity subsidies. We expect that inflation will rebound to an
O
& annual rate of 4½ percent in the current quarter, reflecting the unwinding of the effect of
l
e these subsidies and increases in food prices resulting from the ongoing drought in Mexico
v
e
D and the United States. Mexican inflation should then moderate to 3½ percent over the
n
o remainder of the forecast period. In Brazil, inflation continued to decline against the
c
E
l background of weak output growth, dipping to below 4 percent in the second quarter.
’
t
n
I We project that Brazilian inflation will rise gradually to 5½ percent in 2014 as economic
activity improves.

Financial Developments
Financial conditions registered mixed changes over the intermeeting period,
reflecting several important influences, including generally weaker-than-expected recent
domestic economic data releases, concerns about the euro-area crisis and the outlook for
global growth, actual and expected changes in U.S. monetary policy, and
better-than-anticipated profits at some S&P 500 firms. On net over the period, the
expected path of the federal funds rate shifted down moderately. Yields on nominal
Treasury securities decreased, reflecting the lower expected federal funds rate, the
continuation of the maturity extension program (MEP) through the end of the year, rising
expectations that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy further, and increased
safe-haven demands related to the euro-area crisis. Market-based measures of inflation
compensation declined despite a rise in the prices of oil and agricultural commodities.
Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices edged lower, on net, but spreads on investment- and
speculative-grade corporate bonds relative to comparable-maturity Treasury securities
narrowed slightly. Despite concerns about European developments, conditions in
short-term unsecured dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting
period.
s
In foreign markets, sovereign yields generally declined over the period amid t
n
e
continued weak economic conditions, flight-to-safety flows, and monetary policy easing m
p
by several major central banks, including the ECB. Yields on most euro-area peripheral o
l
e
v
sovereign debt were notable exceptions. As concerns over Spanish public finances and e
D
uncertainties over future steps to be taken by European policymakers mounted, the spread l
a
i
c
on Spanish 10-year bonds relative to German bunds rose to its highest level since the n
a
n
beginning of the euro-area debt crisis. On net, European benchmark equity prices i
F
decreased slightly while European bank equity prices fell sharply. The broad dollar index
rose as the dollar appreciated nearly 5 percent against the euro.
Domestic financing flows were relatively stable over the period.
Investment-grade corporate bond issuance remained robust in June and July, and
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to grow briskly. Consumer credit
expanded further in May. Results from the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on
Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicate that a modest fraction of banks, on net, eased
lending standards over the past three months, and demand for all major categories of

loans strengthened somewhat (see appendix). Those results are consistent with the
modest growth in bank credit observed over that same period. M2 has expanded at a
solid pace of late, likely stemming from investors’ continued desire to hold safe and
liquid assets amid ongoing concerns about the euro-area and the global growth outlook.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
The expected path of the federal funds rate shifted down modestly and Treasury
yields dropped to historic lows over the intermeeting period in response to generally
weak domestic economic data, heighted concerns about the euro area and the global
growth outlook, and increased expectations that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy further. Overall, the June FOMC announcement was viewed as broadly in line
with expectations. However, the FOMC’s decision to continue the MEP was reportedly a
slightly more substantial easing move than some market participants had expected.
As a result, the nominal Treasury yield curve flattened a bit on the announcement.1
Subsequent FOMC communications over this period, including the Chairman’s monetary
policy testimony, elicited limited reactions in financial markets.
The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS rates shifted down
some and now first rises above the current target range in the third quarter of 2014, about
two quarters later than at the time of the June FOMC meeting. The modal federal funds

1 Expectations regarding a continuation of the MEP likely moved longer-term Treasury yields
lower before the extension was announced on June 20. Taking market expectations into account, the
responses of Treasury yields to the announcement appeared to be broadly consistent with predictions from
staff term structure models as described in Canlin Li and Min Wei (2011), “Term Structure Modeling with
Supply Factors and an Application to Maturity Extension Program Evaluation,” memorandum, Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, September 15; and Canlin Li and
Min Wei (2012), “Term Structure Modeling with Treasury and Agency MBS Supply Factors,”
memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs,
January 18.
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

now view the first quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increase in the target
rate, one quarter later than in the June survey. In addition, dealers revised up the
probability that the FOMC will announce additional asset purchases within the next year
from 50 percent to 65 percent, but saw only a 25 percent probability that such an action
will be announced at the August meeting. Dealers also assigned higher odds to the
Committee changing its forward guidance language or the Federal Reserve lowering the
interest rate paid on excess reserves within the next year. In response to a new survey
question, dealers assigned a 30 percent probability that a new tool would be used within
the next year and a 40 percent probability that one would be used within the next two
years. In their written commentary, dealers’ views on what form the new tools would
take varied, though the most frequently cited was a program similar to the Bank of
England’s Funding for Lending Scheme.
On net over the intermeeting period, nominal Treasury yields decreased and the
yield curve flattened moderately, with 2-year yields down 8 basis points and yields on
10- to 30-year Treasury coupon securities lower by 20 to 27 basis points on net. Market
contacts reported that the decline in 2-year yields reflected in part growing expectations
that the interest rate paid on reserve balances may be reduced in coming months,
consistent with the ECB’s decision to cut its deposit rate to zero.
s The staff’s term structure model attributed about half of the drop in longer-term
t
n
e
m Treasury yields to lower real term premiums, likely due to continued investor demand for
p
o the relative safety and liquidity of Treasury securities amid persistent concerns about the
l
e
v euro-area crisis, as well as somewhat increased investor expectations for additional
e
D
policy-easing actions by the FOMC. A smaller portion of the decline in long-term
l
a
i
c nominal Treasury yields appears to have reflected lower inflation expectations and
n
a
n inflation risk premiums. Consistent with this view and despite an increase in commodity
i
F
prices, TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years declined 15 basis
points, while the TIPS-based five-year forward measure decreased 7 basis points, on net,
over the intermeeting period. Swaps- and caps-based measures of inflation compensation
also fell, while survey-based measures of expected inflation were about unchanged.
The Desk’s outright purchases and sales of Treasury securities under the MEP
continued as planned and did not appear to have any material adverse effect on Treasury

market functioning.3 Most measures of Treasury liquidity conditions, including average
trading volumes by primary dealers and the average fitting error from the staff’s nominal
Treasury yield curve, were little changed over the period and stayed close to their recent
averages. Bid–asked spreads were also about unchanged.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Financial stresses in the euro area have intensified, despite some initial easing
following the European summit in late June. (See the box “Recent Developments in the
Euro Area” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section in this
Tealbook.) Spreads on Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds over German equivalents rose
more than 80 basis points over the period, and the Spanish spread reached its highest
level since the beginning of the euro-area debt crisis. Amid this retreat from the
periphery, the yields on 10-year sovereign bonds of Germany and the United Kingdom
declined 30 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. In addition, 2-year sovereign
bonds of Germany and a few other European countries traded at yields below zero after
the ECB cut its policy rates by 25 basis points. The main refinancing rate was lowered to
75 basis points, and, surprising market participants, the ECB’s deposit rate—which sets a
floor under overnight interest rates—was lowered to zero. (See the box “The Effects of
the European Central Bank’s Deposit Rate Cut.”)
s
t
Several other foreign central banks eased policy over the intermeeting period. n
e
m
In support of its fixed-exchange-rate regime against the euro, Denmark’s central bank p
o
reacted by lowering its short-term deposit rate to negative 20 basis points. The Bank of e l
v
e
England increased the size of its asset purchase program by £50 billion to £375 billion. D
l
The bank also announced details on its new Funding for Lending Scheme, which is a
i
c
n
designed to boost bank lending to the nonfinancial sector. (See the box “The Bank of a
n
i
England’s Funding for Lending Scheme.”) In response to slowing growth and F
moderating inflation, the central banks of Brazil, China, and South Korea all reduced
policy rates as well.
3 The Federal Reserve purchased $49 billion and sold or redeemed $61 billion of Treasury
securities over the intermeeting period under the MEP; the average maturity of SOMA Treasury holdings
has lengthened by about three years since the beginning of the program last September. In addition, the
Federal Reserve reinvested $30 billion in agency MBS from principal payments on its holdings of agency
securities.

The euro depreciated sharply against the dollar following the ECB’s policy
announcement and continued to fall as euro-area stresses intensified. However, the broad
nominal index for the dollar is up only modestly over the intermeeting period, as the
dollar’s moves against most other currencies were small and generally offsetting.
Headline equity price indexes in the advanced foreign economies fluctuated over
the period with euro-area developments but were little changed on net. Although
European equity prices rose following the June 29 release of the euro-area summit
statement, these gains were subsequently erased as investor sentiment regarding
euro-area prospects soured again. However, shares in euro-area banks, which are highly
sensitive to any concerns about sovereign conditions, decreased 14 percent over the
period, in part reflecting the downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service of 9 European
banks with global capital market operations, as well as an additional 28 Spanish banks.
Equity prices are down in many key emerging market economies on fears that their
economic performance might be adversely affected by any further slowing in global
growth, with prices in Brazil, China, and South Korea down more than 5 percent.
Foreign official investors’ holdings of Treasury securities increased in May at
about the pace seen since the beginning of the year. More-recent data on custody
holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate further foreign official
purchases of Treasury securities in June and early July, but these purchases were largely s
t
n
offset by sales of agency securities. Foreign private purchases of Treasury securities e

the intermeeting period, although most peripheral euro-area institutions continued to have i

spread—an indicator of dollar funding pressures faced by European banks—was down
slightly on net. The outstanding amount of central bank dollar liquidity swaps edged up
$3 billion to $27 billion, reflecting a small increase in foreign banks’ demand for dollar
funding from the ECB. LIBOR–OIS spreads were little changed. While the scandal
surrounding LIBOR intensified after Barclays settled charges brought by U.S. regulators,
so far there have been no notable disruptions in markets for securities based on LIBOR or
in funding markets more generally. In addition, the spread between the rates implied by

The Effects of the European Central Bank’s Deposit Rate Cut
In response to the ongoing euro‐area debt crisis and mounting downside risks to
euro‐area economic growth, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its key policy
rates 25 basis points during the intermeeting period. The ECB’s main refinancing
rate fell to ¾ percent, and the interest rate the ECB pays on deposits fell to zero.
Short‐term market interest rates moved down in response to the cuts, raising
questions about the viability of money market funds (MMFs) and the smooth
operation of securities repurchase markets and other short‐term funding
markets.
Following the ECB’s action, the overnight interbank interest rate fell roughly
20 basis points to just above one‐tenth of a percent. Short‐term interest rates on
sovereign securities from core euro‐area countries also fell noticeably following
the ECB’s cut. Three‐month Treasury bill rates, shown in the lower‐left figure on
the following page, fell into negative territory in France and the Netherlands,
while German rates, which were already negative, fell further. More surprisingly,
as shown in the lower‐right figure on the following page, two‐year bonds in
Germany and the Netherlands also traded at rates below zero.
The ECB’s rate cut also exerted downward pressure on short‐term interest rates
in neighboring countries that try to constrain exchange rate fluctuations against
the euro. In Switzerland, where the foreign exchange value of the Swiss franc
against the euro has stayed close to the Swiss National Bank’s stated ceiling, two‐
s year interest rates have remained quite negative. The Danish central bank, which
t
n
e pegs its currency to the euro, followed the ECB’s cut by lowering its key policy
m
rates, including reducing the rate on one‐week certificates of deposit (not
p
o shown) to negative 0.20 percent.
l
e
v
e
D Negative short‐term interest rates do not appear to have disrupted market
l
a functioning in the euro area. Trading volumes in euro‐area overnight funding
i
c
n markets (not shown), which had already been low amid the abundance of
a
n liquidity provided by the ECB, have remained at the low end of their historical
i
F
range. Concerns about an increase in fails in repurchase markets, where rates
have also turned negative, do not seem to have been borne out as yet. Although
they play a relatively small role in money markets, several euro‐denominated
MMFs have closed to new investments since the ECB’s cuts, given the low rates
of return they expect to earn on their holdings.
The legal structure of European MMFs differs from that in the United States in
ways that may mitigate the effects of the ECB’s rate cut on that sector. In
particular, most euro‐denominated funds are less restricted than U.S. funds in
the classes of assets they can hold, and some of the funds redeem shares at
Page 54 of 122

--- Page 58 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
variable, rather than fixed, net asset values. As a result, at least some of these
funds may be able to hold assets of slightly lower quality or longer duration that
continue to offer positive returns, and some funds may also have greater
flexibility in accepting negative rates. Although these funds can continue to
operate, the low interest rate environment is likely to reduce their profit margins
and require adjustments to their investment strategies.
Past experiences in advanced foreign economies have shown that activity in
money markets declined in low interest rate environments, although this
damping effect does not appear to have been permanent. During periods of
zero interest rates in Japan, activity in uncollateralized money markets was
essentially nonexistent. Activity in money markets quickly recovered, however,
once the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate above zero, even though the
interest rate never rose above 50 basis points.
In Switzerland and Sweden, the effect of very low interest rates was even less
severe. In 2003, Switzerland experienced a period of very low overnight interest
rates. Trading volumes in overnight markets declined, but there were no other
noticeable effects. During a period of low interest rates between July 2009 and
July 2010, the central bank of Sweden, the Riksbank, charged banks 25 basis
points to place funds in its overnight deposit facility. The Riksbank kept its
deposit rate below zero during that period to maintain a meaningful opportunity
cost for the use of its facility. In Sweden’s case, the negative rate on central bank
s
deposits had only a modest effect on money markets. t
n
e
m
In all, the ECB’s rate cuts successfully lowered euro‐area short‐term interest p
o
rates. The policy action is intended to ease financial conditions and, hence, to e l
v
boost lending and economic activity. While it is possible some adverse effects in e
D
financial markets may develop, if short‐term interest rates stay at these levels for
l
a
an extended period of time, past experience suggests such effects may quickly i
c
n
reverse once rates begin to increase. a

The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme
In June, the governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the
Exchequer announced plans to introduce a temporary Funding for Lending
Scheme (FLS) that would reduce banks’ funding costs and encourage bank
lending to U.K. households and firms. Details were released in July, and the new
measure is expected to be operational in August. Its success will depend in part
on how much it actually reduces banks’ funding costs and on whether funding
costs are in fact impeding new lending.
Under the FLS, the Bank of England (BOE) will stand ready to lend U.K. Treasury
bills to banks participating in the scheme. Banks will be able to initiate requests
for such loans during a “drawdown period” that runs from August 2012 through
January 2014, and the loans can have a maturity of up to four years. The bills
borrowed by the banks can be used as high‐quality collateral to obtain funding at
low interest rates in private securitized lending markets. This method of
providing liquidity assistance, which is also used in the BOE’s Discount Window
Facility, is designed to leave the overall level of bank reserves unchanged.
Although the scheme was announced jointly by the BOE and the U.K. Treasury,
the Treasury is not indemnifying the Bank against losses incurred under the FLS.
Rather, the BOE will rely on the collateral provided by banks as security against
the loan of the Treasury bills. A wide range of collateral will be acceptable,
including the banks’ loans to businesses and households, and substantial haircuts
s will be imposed on illiquid collateral.
t
n
e
m
The scale of borrowing under the FLS could be large. Participating banks are
p
o given an initial borrowing allowance equal to 5 percent of their loans to the U.K.
l
e
v nonfinancial sector as of June 30, 2012. If that allowance were fully utilized,
e
D borrowing under the FLS would amount to about £80 billion, more than
l
a 5 percent of U.K. nominal GDP. Furthermore, the borrowing allowance for any
i
c
n bank will increase pound‐for‐pound with net lending in excess of the end‐of‐June
a
n amount. There is no upper limit on the size of individual or aggregate borrowing
i
F
under the scheme. Amounts borrowed and lent under the scheme by each
participating institution will be made public by the Bank of England on a quarterly
basis.
To help stimulate lending, the cost of using the FLS for a participating bank is
designed to vary inversely with its lending to the U.K. nonfinancial sector. As
shown in the lower‐left figure on the following page, banks that maintain or
increase net lending over the period from June 30, 2012, to the end of 2013 will
pay a fee of 0.25 percent per annum on the amount of Treasury bills borrowed;
banks with declines in net lending over that period will pay an extra
Page 56 of 122

--- Page 60 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
0.25 percentage points for each percentage point decline, up to a maximum fee
of 1.50 percent on the amount borrowed. The overall cost of funding a new loan
under the program is this fee plus the cost of obtaining private‐market funding
secured by Treasury bills. Based on a secured funding rate that is close to the
BOE’s Bank Rate, currently at 0.50 percent, the cost of funding a four‐year loan
for a bank that is expanding its lending could be as low as 0.75 percent. (See the
sterling repo rates shown in the lower‐right figure below.)
The FLS is premised on the view that loan growth has been restrained by high
bank funding costs. In its May Inflation Report, the BOE estimated the marginal
funding cost of extending variable‐rate sterling loans (such as mortgages with
rates that move with the BOE’s Bank Rate ) to be about 3½ percent on average
across banks in April. If this estimate is accurate, then banks may well see
borrowing via the FLS as very attractive, and participation in the scheme could be
high. However, lenders with greater access to low‐cost retail deposits may have
substantially lower costs than those more reliant on the wholesale market for
term funding and would be less likely to participate.
Even if bank participation is high, the impetus to lending provided by the FLS
could be low if factors other than bank funding costs are impeding loan growth
in the United Kingdom. High risk aversion, concerns about bank capital, and
uncertainty over new supervisory standards could be important in restraining
banks’ willingness to make new loans. In addition, dim prospects for economic
s
activity could be limiting the demand for new loans. If such factors are t
n
important, the FLS may not induce a pickup in lending. However, even flat e
m
lending activity could be judged positively if lending would have declined in the p
o
absence of the program. e l

the three-month forward rate agreement and the OIS rate three to six months ahead—a
forward-looking measure of potential funding pressures—edged down on net.
Outstanding unsecured commercial paper (CP) issued by financial institutions
with European parents increased slightly, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Even
so, the average maturity of unsecured financial CP issued by institutions with European
parents remained lower than that for institutions with U.S. parents.
In secured funding markets, Treasury general collateral finance repo (GCF repo)
rates fluctuated some but were roughly unchanged on balance. Movements in the
Treasury GCF repo rate over the period were attributed to a variety of factors, most
notably changes in the level of net settlement of Treasury securities and GSE cash
balances. The intermeeting period saw the introduction of a futures contract tied to the
DTCC Treasury GCF Repo Index (a volume-weighted average of interdealer Treasury
GCF repo trades published by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation), and initial
interest on the part of investors was notable.4
In the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, amounts outstanding
remained stable for programs with sponsors domiciled in both the United States and
Europe. Overnight spreads on ABCP with U.S. and European sponsors were roughly
unchanged. The pace at which money market funds were reducing their exposures to

revenues, and expenses due to litigation and mortgage putbacks by the GSEs also
weighed on earnings. In addition, concerns about the situation in Europe continued to
damp sentiment toward these institutions. Consequently, stock prices for most large
domestic bank holding companies fell over the period, with some declining more than
10 percent, and CDS for those firms moved higher. By contrast, large regional banks’
share prices edged up, as second-quarter earnings results generally beat expectations on
strong mortgage banking performance and improved credit quality.
The mean quarterly return for the hedge fund industry was negative 2.6 percent in
the second quarter, about on par with the S&P 500 return over the same period. In spite
of the negative performance, there was a net capital inflow of $4.1 billion over this
period. Inflows were concentrated at the industry’s largest firms, while smaller funds
experienced net redemptions. The use of leverage remained low across funds.
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Broad equity price indexes edged lower, on net, over the intermeeting period, as
share prices were buffeted by developments in Europe, worrisome domestic economic
data reports, and the first wave of corporate earnings reports for the second quarter,
which were, on balance, not as gloomy as had been feared. The staff’s estimate of the
spread between the expected real return on equity among S&P 500 firms and the real
s
t
10-year Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity premium—was little changed over n
e
m
the intermeeting period and remained very wide by historical standards. p
o
l
e
v
Options-implied one-month-ahead volatility on the S&P 500 index, as measured e
D
by the VIX index, increased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period but remained in a l
i
c
the lower portion of its range over the past five years. Staff analysis suggests that the n
a
n
recent level of the VIX is somewhat low conditional on other measures of i
F
macroeconomic uncertainty. However, options-implied volatility 12 months ahead, while
also about unchanged for the intermeeting period, is somewhat less depressed relative to
historical norms, suggesting that market participants are less sanguine about risks to
equity market performance over the medium term.
On balance, second-quarter earnings reports appear to have been less weak than
market participants anticipated, though expectations were set quite low; the reaction of
share prices to earnings reports has been, on the whole, positive. Earnings from the
roughly one-third of S&P 500 firms that have reported for the second quarter, together

with Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the remaining firms, suggest that aggregate profits
for the nonfinancial sector likely fell slightly on a quarterly basis, while those for the
financial sector experienced a more pronounced decline. Wall Street analysts revised
down their forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms notably over the
four-week period ending in mid-July.
Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds fell further over the
intermeeting period, approaching record lows. The spread of yields on corporate bonds
over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities also narrowed slightly, on net, but
remained somewhat elevated relative to average levels prior to the financial crisis. The
spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on
A1/P1-rated issues were about flat, on balance, over the intermeeting period.
BUSINESS FINANCE
Available indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to
be quite solid as firms generally maintained strong balance sheets. The aggregate ratio of
debt to assets was stable at a relatively low level in the first quarter, and the liquid asset
ratio remained near its highest level in more than 20 years. In the second quarter, the
volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds upgraded by Moody’s exceeded the volume of
bonds downgraded yet again. The six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial
s
t
firms remained low in June. The expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms n
e
m
from the Moody’s KMV model was unchanged in June and July; it remained slightly p
o
elevated by historical standards, reflecting relatively depressed equity prices, which the e l
v
e
model translates into low corporate asset values. D

i
c
Overall, the rate of issuance of debt by financial and nonfinancial firms remained n
a
n
strong over the intermeeting period. Bond issuance by nonfinancial firms, particularly i
F
those with investment-grade ratings, was robust late in the second quarter and continued
to be strong in July. Many issuers reported intending to use the proceeds to pay down
other debt or to finance acquisitions. Bond issuance by financial firms has also been
robust. The volume of nonfinancial CP outstanding rose early in the second quarter but
decreased slightly in June, reflecting weak issuance across most industries. The volume
of C&I loans outstanding increased notably over the intermeeting period. In the
syndicated leveraged loan market, institutional issuance remained solid in the second
quarter, supported by continued strong interest on the part of traditionally unleveraged
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. Based on conversations with

market participants, terms and structures of new leveraged loan deals have loosened
modestly on the margin.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was anemic in June and July.
The near freeze in the IPO market reportedly reflected in part the poor post-IPO
performance of Facebook share prices, as well as pronounced volatility in global
financial markets associated with heightened concerns about the euro area. The most
recent data on share repurchases and stock-financed mergers by nonfinancial firms
indicated that equity retirements overall remained robust in the first quarter, leaving net
equity issuance deeply negative for that quarter. Announcements of mergers and new
share repurchase programs suggested that equity retirements likely remained strong in the
second quarter.
Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) market remained
somewhat strained against a backdrop of weak fundamentals and still-tight underwriting.
Prices for CRE properties, on balance, were stable at low levels, while vacancy and
delinquency rates stayed elevated. Results from the July SLOOS indicate that lending
standards for major categories of CRE loans remain tighter than the midpoint of their
range since 2005 at a large number of banks despite a modest net fraction that reported
having eased standards on such loans over the past few surveys. That said, larger
fractions of banks reported stronger demand for CRE loans, on net, in the July SLOOS s
t
n
than in the previous survey. In addition, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed e
m
p
securities rose noticeably in the second quarter, and, according to market reports, o
l
e
issuance for the remainder of the year is expected to be solid. v

Mortgage rates declined further during the intermeeting period, with the interest i
F
rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages falling to around 3½ percent. Despite
new historical lows for mortgage rates, while refinancing continued to increase, activity
remained muted relative to what staff models would have predicted based on
fundamentals. This muted refinancing is broadly consistent with evidence from the
July SLOOS indicating that mortgage underwriting standards at banks generally have not
eased much from their tightest post-crisis levels, even for prime conforming loans.
Mortgage refinancing through HARP—perhaps accounting for around one-third of
overall refinancing activity in recent months—apparently continued to tick up, but
activity related to the program appears to have varied widely across mortgage servicers,
Page 65 of 122

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
with some respondents in the SLOOS reporting that capacity constraints were limiting
their participation in the HARP. The spread between agency MBS and the 10-year
Treasury yield narrowed somewhat over the intermeeting period. (For information about
the so-called GSE keepwell agreements with the Treasury Department, see the
accompanying box “GSE ‘Keepwell’ Agreements with the U.S. Treasury.”)
Changes in residential mortgage credit quality appear somewhat mixed. House
prices continue to increase, and the increases are reaching a larger share of metropolitan
areas. The CoreLogic house price index climbed for a fifth consecutive month in May,
leaving the index 4 percent higher than its low in the fourth quarter of 2011. Seventy
percent of metropolitan areas experienced a three-month price increase of more than 1
percent, the highest share since early 2006. Even with these increases in house prices,
however, around one-fourth of mortgage borrowers are estimated to remain underwater
on their loans. Although the rate at which mortgages are entering delinquency has been
trending down—likely reflecting the tight underwriting that has been in place for a few
years—the fraction of existing mortgages that are seriously delinquent remains very
elevated.
Consumer credit continued to expand briskly in recent months. Nonrevolving
credit grew at a robust pace in May, owing to both rapid growth in student loans
s originated by the federal government and, to a lesser extent, auto loans made by private
t
n
e
m lenders. Revolving credit also rose in May but was merely 1.6 percent higher than its
p
o level a year before. Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained low, especially for
l
e
v revolving credit, largely reflecting a compositional shift of credit supply over the past few
e
D
years toward the least-risky borrowers. The rate of issuance of consumer ABS picked up
l
a
i
c appreciably in June, making total issuance in the second quarter the highest since the end
n
a
n of the TALF, and issuance has remained robust in July.

GOVERNMENT FINANCE
Since the June FOMC meeting, the Treasury has auctioned $200 billion in
nominal securities and $22 billion in 10- and 30-year TIPS. The auctions were generally
well received, with bid-to-cover ratios mostly above, and indirect bidding ratios close to,
their recent averages.
Despite continued significant fiscal pressures facing state and local governments,
gross long-term issuance of municipal bonds was robust in June and thus far in July.
Page 66 of 122

--- Page 70 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 25, 2012
Net issuance of long-term bonds turned positive in the second quarter after staying in
negative territory for more than a year. Ratings downgrades of municipal bonds by
Moody’s continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the first quarter, and
higher-frequency data on ratings changes suggest that this trend continued in the second
quarter.
In June and July, three cities in California voted to file for bankruptcy. Two of
the cities attributed the filing mainly to sharply declining tax revenue due to the housing
downturn and growing costs of public employee pensions and salaries; these cities
reportedly have a total of around $600 million in bonds outstanding. Despite these
events, in general default rates on municipal bonds remained very low. Market
participants reportedly do not expect the practice of bankruptcy filing by municipalities to
spread widely. As a result, the municipal bond market showed little reaction to the news,
and yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds generally followed Treasury
yields lower over the intermeeting period. CDS spreads for states were roughly
unchanged on net.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
Bank credit grew modestly in June and in the second quarter more broadly,
though at a slightly slower pace than in the first quarter. The slowdown reflected a
s
t
significant step-down in the growth of securities during the second half of the quarter, n
e
m
while growth of loans remained modest over the past three months. C&I loans continued p
o
their brisk expansion in recent months, primarily due to strength at large domestic banks. e l
v
e
In contrast, CRE loans and home equity loans declined in June at rates broadly in line D
l
with recent experience. Closed-end mortgages rose, on balance, in the second quarter, a
i
c
n
the fourth consecutive quarter of modest growth in this category. The drop in this a
n
i
measure in June reportedly reflected substantial sales to the GSEs that more than offset a F
pickup in originations. Consumer loans increased modestly during the quarter as tepid
growth in credit card balances was augmented by a somewhat stronger expansion in other
consumer loans. Noncore loans grew at a faster pace in May and June than earlier in the
year, boosting overall second-quarter loan growth, as reverse repos at large banks rose
rapidly and the category for other loans and leases accelerated at domestic banks. The
slower growth in securities in May and June was accounted for primarily by decreases in
non–U.S. government securities as well as reductions in agency MBS at a few large
domestic banks.

GSE “Keepwell” Agreements with the U.S. Treasury
When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship in August
2008, the U.S. Treasury agreed to provide up to $100 billion in capital
support to each agency to maintain positive net worth as part of the
Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. In February 2009, the
capital support levels were increased to $200 billion for each agency.
Then in December 2009, these “keepwell” agreements were amended to
provide unlimited capital support from 2010 through the end of 2012.
Through the first quarter of 2012, the GSEs have drawn a combined
$187 billion from the U.S. Treasury.
After 2012, the limit for capital support for each GSE will revert to
$200 billion, less the capital drawn during 2008 and 2009. Essentially, the
effect of the amendment to provide unlimited support for the period
between 2010 and 2012 was to raise the cap by the amount of the draws
during those years, which amounted to more than $60 billion. As a
result, Fannie Mae will still have $125 billion in available capital support
and Freddie Mac will have $149 billion ($274 billion combined) at the end
of this year. The expiration date for unlimited support is not expected to
be postponed by the Congress.1
s
n t In October 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) provided
e
m projections of capital draws through 2014 for each of the GSEs under
p
several house price scenarios and found that the GSEs are not likely to
o
l
e approach their capital support limits even under an adverse scenario. In
v
e its baseline scenario, in which house prices were assumed to decline
D
l modestly through mid‐2012 and to increase thereafter, the GSEs were
a
c i expected to draw an additional $8 billion in 2013 and 2014 (combined).
n
a Under the FHFA’s adverse scenario, in which house prices were assumed
n
F i to fall more than 15 percent by mid‐2012 and to increase thereafter, the
GSEs were expected to draw an additional $28 billion in capital support in
2013 and 2014, leaving a combined $246 billion of unused support
1
As part of their ongoing strategic planning, the Federal Housing Finance
Agency announced on July 23, 2012, that it will hire a consultant to develop a
receivership plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after the keepwell agreements
expire.

available. By comparison, the most recent Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress scenario included house
price declines of 8 percent from the first quarter of 2011 through mid‐
2012 (much of which was data by the time of the CCAR), an additional
decline of 15 percent through early 2014, and only a slight improvement
toward the end of 2014. Under the CCAR supervisory stress scenario,
GSE capital draws could be substantially higher than in the FHFA’s
adverse scenario and place the GSEs closer to their limits.
Since the FHFA made its projections, the GSEs’ earnings profiles have
improved markedly, suggesting that these projections might well
overstate the likely draws in those scenarios. In the first quarter of 2012,
Fannie Mae posted positive earnings, thereby avoiding a capital draw. In
addition, Freddie Mac requested only $19 million in capital support that
quarter. Smaller‐than‐expected single‐family portfolio losses have
supported these improved earnings. Moreover, the better outlooks for
house prices and mortgage delinquencies in recent months have further
improved agency earnings prospects. That said, the mandatory
10 percent dividend payments to the U.S. Treasury continue to weigh on
agency earnings.
s
To date, market participants do not appear concerned about the n t
e
expiration of unlimited capital support for the GSEs arguably because the m
p
remaining capital support is large relative to the agencies’ cumulative o
l
draws of capital from 2008 through early this year. However, a e
v
e
significant deterioration in the housing sector beyond that considered by D
the FHFA could lead investors to focus more attention on the risk that l
a
i
the GSEs could require Treasury support beyond the remaining amounts c
n
available to them. In that event, the prices of GSE debt and MBS could a
n
i
be significantly affected. F

According to the July SLOOS, modest net fractions of domestic banks, on
balance, reported having eased their lending standards further over the past three months
for most categories of loans, while relatively large net fractions reported stronger demand
for many types of loans. In particular, a modest fraction of domestic banks reported that
C&I loan standards for large and middle-market firms had eased, on net, and large
fractions continued to report that the spread of rates on such loans over their bank’s cost
of funds had decreased. However, significantly smaller fractions of domestic
respondents, on average, reported stronger demand for C&I loans than had done so in the
previous survey. According to a set of annual questions asked in the July SLOOS,
lending standards on C&I loans have returned to about the middle of the range that those
standards have occupied since 2005, but for all other major loan categories, banks
continued to report that their credit standards remained at least somewhat tighter, on
balance, than the middle of their respective ranges over that same period.
M2 advanced at an annual rate of 6¼ percent, on average, in June and July. The
level of M2 remained elevated relative to what would be expected based on historical
relationships with nominal income and opportunity costs. The elevated level is likely
related to investors’ continued desire to hold safe and liquid assets amid ongoing
concerns about the European crisis and the global growth outlook. Liquid deposits, the
largest component of M2, increased at an annual rate of 9½ percent, largely because of
s
another sizable shift of deposits from offshore bank branches to onshore entities. These t
n
e
funds likely accounted for an uptick in the amount of noninterest-bearing deposits that m
p
currently receive unlimited FDIC insurance.5 o

D
Currency grew at a rate slightly above its historical average in June and July,
l
a
while retail money funds and small time deposits continued to decline. The monetary c i
n
a
base rose as reserve balances and currency expanded over the period. The increase in n
i
F
reserve balances was driven in large part by fluctuations in the Treasury’s general
account, movements in which are typically volatile. (See the box “Balance Sheet
Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”)
5 Offshore deposits have been included in the FDIC’s assessment base since April 2011, negating
some of the benefits to banks of booking these deposits abroad. The staff estimates that this most recent
shift of deposits boosted M2 growth by 2.1 percentage points, on average, over June and July.
The Dodd–Frank Act provides temporary, unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-
bearing transaction accounts in excess of $250,000 from December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012.
These deposits are estimated to have grown nearly 50 percent from December 31, 2010, and currently make
up about 15 percent of M2 or about $1.5 trillion.

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
Over the intermeeting period, total assets of the Federal Reserve edged down
$10 billion to $2,856 billion (see the table on the next page).
Since the June FOMC meeting, the Open Market Desk conducted 22 operations
as part of the maturity extension program: The Desk purchased $49 billion in
Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years and sold or allowed
to mature without reinvestment $61 billion in Treasury securities with maturities
of 3 years or less.1 Since the maturity extension program was announced last
September, the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings has
risen from 6.1 years to 9.1 years. In addition, the Desk reinvested $30 billion of
agency debt and agency MBS principal payments in agency MBS securities.2
Foreign central bank liquidity swaps increased $3 billion to $27 billion, reflecting
an increase in draws by the European Central Bank (ECB). Following the ECB’s
cut in its deposit rate, market rates on euro‐denominated repo transactions
against the safest collateral turned negative, and the Desk placed euro‐
denominated funds in the Exchange Stabilization Fund and System Open Market
Account on deposit at official institutions rather than invest in repos at negative
rates. The net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane III LLC and Maiden Lane LLC
decreased $6 billion and $1 billion, respectively, because of asset sales. Proceeds
from asset sales from Maiden Lane III portfolios enabled the repayment of the
remaining equity contribution by American International Group, Inc. Proceeds
s from asset sales from the Maiden Lane portfolio enabled the repayment of the
t
n
e remaining balances of the loans extended by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Loans
m
outstanding under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were
p
o slightly lower. On June 28, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it
l
e
v agreed with the Treasury Department that it was appropriate to reduce from
e
D $4 billion to $1 billion the credit protection that Treasury is providing for TALF. To
l
a date, TALF has experienced no losses, and the Board continues to see it as highly
i
c
n unlikely that any recourse to the Treasury protection will be necessary.
a
n
i
F
Liabilities of the Federal Reserve also decreased slightly. The U.S. Treasury’s
General Account, which is highly volatile from month to month, decreased
$91 billion, while reserve balances at depository institutions increased $82 billion.
Term deposits held by depository institutions increased $3 billion, as a small‐value
operation of the Term Deposit Facility was conducted on July 16.

A purchase of $5 billion conducted on July 23, 2012, and a purchase of $2 billion

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS),
modest fractions of domestic banks, on balance, continued to report having eased their lending
standards across most loan types over the past three months.1 In addition, relatively large
fractions reported stronger demand for many types of loans over that period. Staff models
suggest that the amount of easing reported was about in line with what would be expected after
accounting for a number of bank-specific factors and several key macroeconomic variables over
the survey period. In contrast, reflecting the continued financial strains in Europe, lending
standards at branches and agencies of foreign banks continued to tighten for commercial and
industrial (C&I) loans and were unchanged for commercial real estate (CRE) loans; demand for
both types of loans reportedly weakened, on net, at those institutions. The July survey also
contained a number of special questions on lending to, and competition from, European banks. In
addition, the survey asked about the revised Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP 2.0)
and repeated a set of special questions from a year ago on the current level of standards relative to
their range since 2005 for a broad variety of loan categories.
Bank lending policies for C&I loans at domestic banks generally eased over the past three
months, though mostly for large and middle-market firms. Although a modest fraction of
domestic banks reported having eased standards on C&I loans to those firms, standards on loans
to small firms were little changed on balance.2 In addition, domestic banks continued to ease
s
t
n
many terms on C&I loans to all types of firms, though the net proportion of banks doing so was
e
m
generally smaller than that in the April survey. Loan demand from large and middle-market firms
p
o
strengthened somewhat further over the past three months, on net, but the increase was much less l
e
v
widespread than indicated in the April survey. Meanwhile, loan demand from small firms was e

unchanged, on balance, over this period.

1 The July 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses
and households over the past three months. This appendix is based on responses from 64 domestic banks
and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. As part of the recent renewal of the SLOOS,
7 domestic banks have been added to the previous sample of banks. These additions did not materially
change the net fraction of banks responding to a particular question. Respondent banks received the survey
on or after July 3, 2012, and responses were due by July 17, 2012.
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased
standards. For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.
2 Large and middle-market firms are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million or
more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

two-thirds of foreign banks reported that they extend credit to banks headquartered in Europe or
their affiliates or subsidiaries. Large fractions of these institutions indicated that they had
tightened standards on such loans over the past three months—fractions that were significantly
higher than those in the April survey. For the third consecutive survey, a sizable fraction of
domestic banks, weighted by C&I loans, reported that their business had increased due to
decreased competition from European banks. Furthermore, a very large majority of domestic
banks reported that they remain willing to accommodate business in the second half of 2012
arising from decreased European competition.
Lending conditions for CRE loans at domestic banks also reportedly continued to ease
from very tight levels. A modest fraction of such banks, on balance, reported that they had eased
standards over the past three months, while a relatively sizable fraction, on net, continued to
indicate that demand for such loans had strengthened. In light of the responses to special
questions on the level of standards for different types of CRE loans, the easing reported in recent
surveys likely reflects changes in standards for loans secured by multifamily real estate and to a
lesser extent by nonfarm, nonresidential properties.
Meanwhile, lending standards over the past three months were little changed for prime
mortgages, and tightened somewhat for nontraditional mortgages on net. However, a relatively
large fraction of respondents reported having experienced stronger demand for prime mortgages
over the past three months, likely related to a pickup in refinancing activity.
Responses to the set of special questions on HARP 2.0 indicate that a majority of large
mortgage lenders are participating in the program, though many smaller banks are not. Weighted
by closed-end residential mortgages held on banks’ books, the majority of respondents that are t s
n
participating reported that the proportion of HARP refinance applications relative to total e
m
refinance applications had been significant over the past three months. An even larger majority p
o
indicated that they anticipate that more than 60 percent of HARP applications will be approved e l
v
and successfully completed. More than one-half of domestic banks, on a weighted basis, reported e
D
that capacity constraints were limiting the number of HARP applications that they could process l
a
i
and that they were restricting their participation in the program to those mortgages that are c
n
a
already serviced or held by their banks. n

Lending conditions for consumer loans reportedly eased over the past three months.
Domestic banks indicated that standards on auto loans had eased moderately, while those on
credit card loans had eased modestly on net. Standards on other consumer loans remained little
changed. In addition, small net fractions of banks reported increased demand for credit card and
other consumer loans, while a relatively large fraction of banks reported an increase in demand
for auto loans.
A final set of special questions, which were also asked in the July 2011 survey, prompted
banks to assess their current lending standards relative to the middle of the range that those
standards have occupied since 2005. On a portfolio-weighted basis, lending standards on C&I

loans at domestic banks reportedly have almost fully returned to about the middle of that range.
However, credit standards for all other categories of loans remained at least somewhat tighter, on
balance, than the middle of their respective ranges over the same period. In particular, across all
residential mortgage categories, including prime conforming loans, the majority of banks
indicated that their standards are currently either significantly tighter than the middle of the range
or still at the tightest level that standards have been since 2005.
LENDING TO BUSINESSES
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending
A modest fraction of domestic banks continued to report having eased standards on C&I
loans to large and middle-market firms; standards on loans to small firms were little changed, on
balance, for the third consecutive survey. As in the previous survey, no domestic bank indicated
having tightened standards on loans to either type of firm. In contrast, a small number of U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks reported having tightened their standards on C&I loans
for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consistent with the ongoing strains in the European financial
system, the few foreign respondents that reported having tightened over this period were
predominantly subsidiaries of European banks.
Domestic banks continued to ease many terms on C&I loans, on balance, to all types of
firms, though the proportion of banks doing so was generally smaller than that in the April
survey. One exception was the cost of credit lines, for which relatively more respondents
reported having eased their lending terms over the past three months. In addition, relatively large
fractions of respondents continued to indicate that they had narrowed the spreads on C&I loan
s
rates over their cost of funds and had reduced their use of interest rate floors. However, when the n t
e
responses for loans to small firms are weighted by the volume of small C&I loans on banks’ m
p
books (a proxy for the amount of lending to small businesses), the responses suggest that declines o
l
e
in the spreads on such loans have not been as widespread as indicated by the unweighted v
e
responses. The weighted responses are more consistent with the stubbornly elevated spreads for D
l
smaller C&I loans still observed in the Survey of Terms of Business Lending. Foreign banks, on a
i
c
the other hand, reported little change in most C&I lending terms over the past three months, with n
a
the exception of the cost of credit lines, the maximum size of credit lines, and premiums charged n
i
F
on riskier loans, for which terms have tightened slightly on net.
Almost all domestic banks that reported having eased standards or terms on C&I loans
continued to cite more-aggressive competition from other banks and nonbank lenders as a reason.
Only about one-fourth of the banks that had eased lending policies had done so because of a more
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook, and few banks cited any of the other reasons listed
in the survey. Meanwhile, large majorities of the few banks, both domestic and foreign, that
reported having tightened C&I credit standards or terms cited a less favorable or more uncertain
economic outlook as a reason.

A significantly smaller fraction of banks than in the previous survey reported stronger
demand for C&I loans over the past three months. Only a modest fraction of domestic banks
indicated that the demand for C&I loans by large and middle-market firms had been stronger, on
balance, while demand for loans by small firms was unchanged. However, weighted by C&I
loans outstanding, a moderate fraction of banks, on balance, reported increased demand for loans
to large and middle-market firms, more consistent with the strong growth in aggregate
outstanding C&I loans in the H.8 bank credit data. On net, domestic banks also continued to
report a rise in the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers regarding new or
increased credit lines. In contrast, demand for C&I loans at foreign banks reportedly had
weakened somewhat further for the second consecutive survey.
A large majority of banks that reported stronger demand for C&I loans cited increases in
customers’ funding needs related to inventories and accounts receivable, mergers and
acquisitions, and investment in plant or equipment as important factors underlying the increase.
At the same time, at least three-fourths of the domestic and foreign banks indicating that demand
had decreased reported that a decrease in investment in plant or equipment was an important
factor.
Special Questions on Lending to and Competition from European Banks
The July survey asked a set of special questions about lending to, and competition from,
banks headquartered in Europe and their affiliates and subsidiaries (regardless of the location of
the affiliates or subsidiaries). Many of these questions were also asked in the previous three
surveys. The survey responses continued to show that while strains in the European financial
system are affecting the distribution of business lending activity in the United States, overall

experienced increases in C&I loans over the first half of this year indicated that either a moderate
or a small portion of that increase had been attributable to purchases of loans from European
banks.
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending
Lending conditions for CRE loans at domestic banks also reportedly continued to ease.
A modest fraction of domestic banks, on balance, reported having eased standards on CRE loans

over the past three months, while a relatively sizable fraction, on net, continued to indicate having
experienced stronger demand for such loans. However, weighted responses to the special
question on the current level of standards relative to their recent range on specific CRE loan
categories (discussed in greater detail below) suggest that lending standards on construction and
land development loans, in particular, have actually tightened somewhat since last year,
suggesting that the thaw in CRE lending standards seen in recent surveys likely has been limited
to other CRE loan categories. In addition, foreign survey respondents, which held a relatively
minor share of the outstanding CRE loans held in the U.S. banking sector, indicated that
standards on such loans were unchanged for the second straight survey and that demand had been
noticeably weaker, on net, over the past three months.
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending
Standards for residential real estate loans remained very tight despite some brighter news
in the housing sector recently. Domestic banks continued to report little change in lending
standards for prime mortgages and having tightened standards somewhat for nontraditional
mortgages over the past three months on net. Meanwhile, a relatively large fraction of
respondents reported having experienced stronger demand for prime mortgages over the same
time period on balance. Some of the stronger demand may have been attributable to recently
heightened refinancing activity, even though banks were specifically asked to consider only new
originations and not to consider refinances in the survey. A relatively large fraction of banks also
reported stronger demand for nontraditional mortgages, though one very large bank reported that
demand had been weaker in that segment.

60 percent of HARP applications will be approved and successfully completed. More than
one-half of domestic banks, on a weighted basis, reported that capacity constraints at their bank
were either the most important factor or a very important factor limiting the number of HARP
applications that they could process. Similar fractions indicated that their bank had decided to
restrict its participation in HARP to those mortgages that it already serviced or held. Many banks
also reported that credit overlays that they had imposed on top of the HARP requirements were
somewhat important factors in limiting their participation—nearly one-half of all respondents, on
a weighted basis, reported being unwilling to offer HARP refinance loans to some customers with
high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios or with low FICO scores.
Questions on Consumer Lending
Moderate fractions of domestic banks reported that standards on auto loans had eased, on
net, while somewhat smaller net fractions indicated that standards on credit card loans had eased.
Standards on other consumer loans remained little changed. Banks again reported having
narrowed spreads on auto loans, while other terms across the three categories of consumer loans
remained relatively little changed on net.
The fraction of respondents that indicated that they were more willing to make consumer
installment loans now as opposed to three months ago remained elevated by historical standards,
for the second consecutive survey.
Demand for all types of consumer loans strengthened on net. A relatively large fraction
of banks reported stronger demand for auto loans, on balance, while only modest net fractions of
banks reported stronger demand for credit card loans and for other consumer loans. However, the
s
share of banks that indicated that they had experienced higher demand decreased a bit, on net, for n t

Norms D
The July survey repeated a set of special questions from July 2011 that asked respondents l

to describe the current level of lending standards at their bank, rather than changes in standards c
n
over the survey period.4 Banks were asked to consider the range over which standards have n a
i
F
varied between 2005 and the present and to report where standards reside relative to the midpoint
of that range. With the exception of standards on C&I loans at domestic banks, banks continued
to report, on balance, that their credit standards remained at least somewhat tighter than the
middle of the range. Still, consistent with the modest easing of standards, on average, that was
mortgage loans sold. The latter measure includes mortgages sold to the GSEs, with servicing retained or
with recourse or other seller-provided credit enhancements.
4 The description of the results in this section is based on responses weighted by the outstanding
loans in the respective loan category. Results based on unweighted responses can be materially different,
especially when a limited number of large banks dominate a particular lending market and the remainder of
the banks respond to related questions in a different manner from those large banks.

reported across most categories of loans in the quarterly surveys over the past year, the levels of
standards at domestic banks were generally not quite as tight as in July 2011.
A majority of domestic banks reported that lending standards on four different categories
of C&I loans (investment-grade and noninvestment-grade syndicated loans, other loans to large
firms, and loans to small firms) were about at the middle of the range that those standards have
occupied since 2005. That result appears to be consistent with the robust aggregate growth in
C&I loans since 2011. However, the fraction of foreign banks that indicated that the levels of
standards on large C&I loans were tighter than the middle of the range was somewhat higher than
that of domestic banks.5
A significant net fraction of domestic banks reported that the current level of standards on
all types of CRE loans (construction and land development loans; loans secured by nonfarm,
nonresidential structures; and loans secured by multifamily structures) is tighter than the middle
of the range that those standards have occupied since 2005. Moreover, the net fraction of banks
that reported that lending standards for construction and land development loans were at least
somewhat tighter than the midpoint of their range since 2005 increased, on net, relative to when
the same set of questions was asked in July 2011. In contrast, both for loans secured by nonfarm,
nonresidential properties and for lending supported by multifamily properties, a number of large
banks shifted their response from “significantly tighter” to “somewhat tighter” than the midpoint
of their respective ranges, suggesting that conditions in those markets had eased to some extent
over the past year.
The levels of lending standards appear to be relatively little changed, on balance, since
July 2011 for all four categories of residential mortgage loans included in the survey (prime t s
n
conforming mortgages, prime jumbo mortgages, nontraditional mortgages, and HELOCs). As e
m
was the case in last year’s survey, almost all banks reported that standards are still at least p
o
somewhat tighter than the middle of the range that those standards have occupied since 2005. For e l
v
prime conforming loans and for prime jumbo loans, the fraction of banks indicating that standards e
D
were the tightest they had been since 2005 fell somewhat, but the fraction reporting that standards l
a
i
were significantly tighter than the midpoint of the recent range increased by a larger amount, c
n

suggesting little change in overall conditions on net. n
i
F
With respect to consumer loans, large fractions of domestic banks continued to report that
lending standards were tighter than the middle of the range that those standards have occupied
since 2005 for prime credit card, subprime credit card, auto, and other consumer loans. However,
the fractions of respondents that reported that standards on these loan categories were
significantly tighter fell noticeably, while the fractions reporting that standards were only
somewhat tighter rose since last year, suggesting some easing of overall standards on net.
5 As only a limited number of foreign respondents reported on the level of standards on loans to
small firms and CRE loans, we do not report those responses here.

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first two
scenarios consider opposing risks to domestic demand—the downside risk associated
with the fiscal cliff at the beginning of next year and the upside risk that the underlying
pace of the recovery is more robust than the recent economic news seems to suggest.
The next two scenarios focus on opposing risks to inflation—the possibility that we have
underestimated the extent of labor market damage that has occurred, implying greater
upward pressure on prices in coming years, and the chance that the stability of various
measures of expected inflation turns out to be misleading us about the potential for
disinflation. The final two scenarios consider risks to the U.S. economic outlook
associated with developments abroad. In the first, a much more severe fiscal and
financial crisis in Europe spills over to the United States and the rest of the global
economy; in the second, a substantial deceleration in economic activity in China and
other Asian countries slows the pace of the U.S. recovery.
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two
scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA model. For the simulations with the FRB/US
model, we use the same estimated monetary policy rule that governs the path of the
federal funds rate in the baseline. For the simulations with the SIGMA model, we use a
generally similar policy rule that employs an alternative concept of resource utilization.1
In all of the scenarios, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to
follow their baseline paths. In this Tealbook we are including two new exhibits,
“Alternative Projections” and “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks.” (See the box
“New Exhibits in the Risks and Uncertainty Section” and the related exhibits at the end
of this section.)

Fiscal Cliff
Our baseline projection assumes that most federal tax provisions that are nearing
expiration—including the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and 2003, relief for most
taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, and a number of other non-stimulus-related
tax reductions—will eventually be extended.2 In contrast, this scenario assumes that all
of these tax provisions are allowed to expire next year, thereby increasing total tax
payments from households and businesses by about 2½ percent of GDP relative to
baseline. The automatic spending cuts required by the sequestration associated with the
Budget Control Act of 2011 take full effect in 2013, further restraining federal purchases
by about ¼ percent of GDP relative to baseline.3 In addition, these fiscal policy
developments are assumed to weigh on consumer and business confidence by more than
in the baseline. As a result, real GDP expands only 1 percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in
2014, on average 1 percentage point per year slower than in the baseline. The
unemployment rate rises to 8¾ percent in 2014.4 With a wider margin of slack in both
labor and product markets, inflation declines to 1¼ percent by 2015, and the federal
funds rate does not begin to increase from its effective lower bound until early 2016.
Faster Recovery
This scenario assumes that both the staff and financial market participants have
underestimated the future pace of the economic recovery, in part because
seasonal-adjustment distortions and other factors have obscured the underlying strength
of the real economy. In particular, both business investment and consumer outlays on
durable goods rise faster than expected, as firms and households work to bring the
still-depressed levels of these capital stocks closer to their longer-run trends. In addition,
2 As described in “Key Background Factors” of the Domestic Economic Developments and
Outlook section, the staff’s baseline forecast assumes that the temporary payroll tax cut and the EUC
program will expire at the beginning of next year, that federal discretionary spending will be restrained by
the caps set in the Budget Control Act and by reductions in defense spending as overseas military
operations draw down, and that more-gradual deficit-reduction policies will replace the automatic spending
sequestration. These policy assumptions in the baseline account for almost one-half of the deficit reduction
associated with the full effect of the policies related to the entire fiscal cliff.

the greater-than-expected increases in house prices seen since the beginning of the year
turn out to signal that a significant headwind for the recovery is abating more rapidly than
anticipated, with favorable implications for construction, household wealth, and the
willingness of financial institutions to extend credit. In this environment, investor
sentiment recovers more quickly, leading to a faster decline in risk premiums, and hence
lower borrowing costs and higher wealth. These factors, in turn, contribute to a cycle of
increased confidence, employment, credit availability, and spending that boosts the pace
of the recovery further. Real GDP accelerates to an average annual growth rate of
3¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, bringing the unemployment rate down to 6½ percent by the
end of 2014. Upward pressure on inflation is initially tempered by the effects of stronger
capital investment on labor productivity and unit labor costs. Over time, however,
greater resource utilization causes inflation to move above baseline to a level consistent
with long-run inflation expectations (which remain well anchored) and the Committee’s
longer-run objective. In response to the stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds
rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the first half of 2013.
Damaged Labor Market
The unusual depth and breadth of the downturn may have impaired the efficiency
of labor markets and boosted the NAIRU by more than estimated in the baseline. In this
scenario, we assume that the NAIRU reached 7 percent in early 2011 (1 percentage point
above baseline) and that it will remain at this level for the indefinite future. Furthermore,
the trend labor force participation rate is assumed to decline further and is 1 percentage
point below baseline by 2015. These conditions imply lower long-run levels of
household income and corporate earnings; as a result, underlying aggregate demand is
weaker, and the unemployment rate barely inches down over the next few years.
Nonetheless, labor market slack remains persistently narrower in this scenario than in the
baseline because of the higher NAIRU, implying higher unit labor costs and greater
upward pressure on consumer prices. These price pressures are magnified by
policymakers’ initial failure to recognize the weaker supply-side conditions, which leads
them to maintain a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than they would have
chosen with a more accurate assessment of the supply side. As a result, the public’s y
t
n
long-run inflation expectations move up and actual inflation gradually rises to a i

2½ percent. In response to these more inflationary conditions, the federal funds rate e

begins to rise earlier and more rapidly than in the baseline. U

Disinflation
The stability of various measures of expected inflation may be misleading us
about the potential for further disinflation, particularly in the context of the baseline
assessment that considerable margins of slack in labor and product markets will persist
for some time. In this scenario, both expected and actual inflation drift down over time,
with headline inflation falling to about ½ percent by 2014; such declines would be in line
with the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips curve models. Real interest rates are
higher, reflecting both lower inflation in conjunction with the effective zero lower bound
and higher bond premiums resulting from investors’ concern about the durability of the
recovery. The higher real interest rates restrain aggregate spending modestly and raise
unemployment relative to baseline. The federal funds rate remains at its effective lower
bound until late 2016.
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers
In this scenario, the current stress in European financial markets intensifies further
and causes Europe to plunge into a severe financial crisis and a deep recession. This
outcome could result from the exit of Greece from the euro area, widespread runs on
bank deposits, a disorderly sovereign default, or the failure of a large European bank.5
Reflecting the greater financial stress, both sovereign and private borrowing costs in
Europe soar—with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline—and
the confidence of European households and businesses plummets. Real GDP in Europe
declines about 9 percent relative to baseline by the end of 2013, notwithstanding a
25 percent depreciation in the real effective foreign exchange value of the euro. Europe’s
difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to the rest of
the world, including the United States. U.S. economic activity contracts sharply, as U.S.
corporate bond spreads rise more than 300 basis points, the stock market plunges, credit
availability is restricted, and household and business confidence erodes. In addition,
weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress
U.S. net exports. All told, U.S. real GDP declines at an average annual rate of about
3 percent through the end of next year. The unemployment rate rises to 11¼ percent in
2014 before beginning to gradually decline. With substantially greater resource slack and y

5 European policymakers could take more-sizable steps toward resolving the crisis than assumed U

in the baseline, thereby substantially easing financial and fiscal stresses and prompting a faster European

recovery. This possibility was analyzed in one of the alternative scenarios presented in Book A of the k

2013; inflation turns positive in 2014 as a recovery in economic activity begins to take
hold.6 Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound
until early 2017.
Hard Landing in China
Although real GDP growth in China has slowed substantially in recent quarters, in
our baseline forecast China’s economy continues to expand at close to an 8 percent rate.
However, important downside risks attend this outlook, including a real estate collapse or
a sharp deceleration in the supply of credit if problems mount in China’s banking sector.
In this scenario, despite stimulative government policies, real GDP growth in China falls
to a 5 percent pace over the next two years due to tighter credit conditions, lower
investment, and reduced household and business confidence. Moreover, we assume that
China’s slowdown has pronounced global spillovers, especially to other major U.S.
trading partners in Asia. As a result, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar
appreciates about 5 percent above baseline and total foreign growth falls 1 percentage
point below baseline. The stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth, in combination,
represent an unusually large shock to the U.S. external sector, particularly as these
restraining factors persist for over two years. U.S. real net exports decline substantially,
leading U.S. real GDP to expand at an annual rate of only about 1 percent in the second
half of this year and in 2013. The unemployment rate rises to 8½ percent by the end of
this year and remains at that level through 2014. Core PCE inflation declines to just
above 1¼ percent in 2013 and 2014 because of both the appreciation in the foreign
exchange value of the dollar and lower resource utilization. The liftoff of the federal
funds rate from its effective lower bound is delayed until the middle of 2015.
y
n t 6 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking
i
a nature of inflation determination in SIGMA and the relatively modest degree of structural inflation
t
e r persistence. In particular, long-run inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at 2 percent, marginal
c
n costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital
U
spending). In addition, import price inflation runs significantly higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s
&
initial appreciation is gradually reversed. Under alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance,
s
k allowed for more structural persistence in the inflation process or a less firm anchoring of inflation
s
R i expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

New Exhibits in the Risks and Uncertainty Section
With this Tealbook, we introduce two new exhibits in the Risks and Uncertainty
section. One exhibit, “Alternative Projections,” compares the staff’s baseline
forecast with three alternative economic projections. The second exhibit,
“Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks,” presents estimates of the likelihood
of specific economic events associated with inflation, unemployment, and a
recession. These exhibits will ordinarily be presented for reference, without
explanatory text.
The first page of the two‐page exhibit “Alternative Projections” compares the
Tealbook baseline projection with forecasts from the staff’s FRB/US and EDO
models along with the consensus forecast from the Blue Chip survey. The second
page provides a graphical representation of the Blue Chip consensus forecast
and the staff’s baseline projection along with information about the range of
forecasts from the Blue Chip panel. The FRB/US model is a workhorse model of
the Board staff. It is used for a variety of purposes, including to generate most of
the alternative scenarios that appear in this section. EDO is another workhorse
model of the Board staff; it is an estimated dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) model, similar in structure to several other DSGE models in
use around the System, and forecasts from EDO are regularly included in the
Systemwide analysis of DSGE models. In addition, the staff has long consulted
forecasts from both the FRB/US and EDO models when preparing its judgmental
economic projection.
The “Alternative Projections” table can be used to assess how the latest
forecasts from these four sources compare, as well as to see how each has
evolved since the time of the previous Tealbook. For example, the FRB/US
forecast currently shows a gradual acceleration in real GDP through 2014 that is a
bit steeper but not greatly different than the staff projection. In comparison, the
EDO forecast shows an acceleration in real GDP earlier in the projection period.
In regard to revisions since the last Tealbook, the FRB/US forecast for real GDP
growth has revised up in 2013, relative to June, while the other projections are
nearly unchanged. The upward revision to the FRB/US projection reflects that
model’s more favorable estimates of underlying financial conditions and trend
output growth.
The two‐page exhibit “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” presents
y
t estimated probabilities of selected macroeconomic events based on stochastic
n
a i simulations of the FRB/US and EDO models as well as two other, nonstructural
t
e r models, namely, a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model and a factor
c
n model. The BVAR model contains six quarterly variables: real GDP growth, the
U
unemployment rate, total PCE inflation, the percent change in the relative price
&
s of crude oil, the federal funds rate, and the spread of the BBB bond rate over the
k
s 90‐day Treasury bill rate. The spareness of structure and judgment underlying
i

the BVAR model provides a useful comparison with the staff’s FRB/US and EDO
models, both of which naturally embody the views of the model builders. Finally
there is the factor model—the same one that was described in the box
“Assessing the Near‐Term Outlook with Factor Models” in the March 2012
Tealbook—which, because of its orientation toward short‐term forecasting, is
used only in the bottom panel of the table.
The top panels of both pages focus on inflation; the table on the first page
presents estimated probabilities that total PCE inflation over the next four
quarters—currently, the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2013—will
be either 1 percentage point above or 1 percentage point below the Committee’s
stated long‐run objective. In the top panel on the second page, time series are
displayed of the probabilities from two of the models used to generate the
results in the table. These time series of probabilities, which are estimated using
real‐time data, provide a historical perspective on what constitutes an unusually
high or low probability and on how these probabilities fluctuate over time. The
middle panels of both pages present probabilities that the unemployment rate
will increase or decrease by 1 percentage point over the four quarters following
the latest quarterly observation. (Currently, therefore, the probabilities describe
the distribution of the change in the unemployment rate from the second
quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013.) The bottom panel of both pages
presents the models’ estimated probabilities that real GDP will decline in both of
the next two quarters, a commonly used definition of a recession.
The event probabilities around the staff projection (the first column in the table)
are based on historical Tealbook forecast errors applied to the Tealbook baseline,
similar to the procedure for the confidence intervals based on Tealbook
projection errors that are regularly presented in the exhibit “Selected Tealbook
Projections and 70 Percent Confidence Intervals” in this section. All of the other
probability estimates shown are based on stochastic simulations of the relevant
model carried out with respect to each model’s baseline forecast, with the
shocks drawn from the distribution of each model’s historical residuals.
As noted earlier, the charts on the second page provide a historical perspective
on the event probabilities estimated from two of the models. To take inflation as
an example, both the FRB/US and BVAR models viewed the risk of inflation being
higher than 3 percent to be elevated in early 2008, owing to increases in food
y
t
and energy prices at that time. But that assessment turned out to be short lived n
i
a
as the recession deepened, and by the end of 2008 and into 2009, both models t
r
e
instead saw the risk of inflation being below 1 percent to be elevated. In c
n
contrast, the two models differed in their views of inflation risks during the 2001– U
04 period: In late 2001, the BVAR model saw very high risks of low inflation while &
the FRB/US model was relatively sanguine; the reverse pattern occurred in 2003. k s
