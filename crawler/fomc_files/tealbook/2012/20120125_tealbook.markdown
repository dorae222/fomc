Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
A number of the indicators that we track in gauging the current and near-future D
n
pace of economic activity have improved since the December Tealbook. Payroll o
c
E
employment increased a little more in December than in the average of the preceding
c
i
t
several months and the unemployment rate continued to decline, manufacturing s
e
m
production rebounded from a dip in November, and even residential construction has o
D
shown a bit more vigor recently. In addition, measures of consumer and business
sentiment have moved up. However, these developments have not materially exceeded
our expectations; rather, for the most part, they have only been sufficient to validate our
forecast in previous Tealbooks of a gradually improving pace of real activity. Moreover,
despite the bounceback in consumer sentiment from recent lows, consumer spending
appears to be on a somewhat shallower trajectory than we had previously expected, and
federal outlays for defense have been significantly lower than anticipated. All told, we
now estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2011 and will rise 1½ percent in the current quarter, ¼ percentage point and
½ percentage point less, respectively, than in the December Tealbook.
We also made a small downward adjustment to our medium-term projection. The
foreign exchange value of the dollar has moved up a little, on balance, since the
December Tealbook and is anticipated to subtract a bit from the demand for U.S.
products. Real GDP growth is further tempered by a somewhat higher path for crude oil
prices, while the changes in our other conditioning factors are neutral, on balance, for the
pace of activity: The effects of higher stock prices and lower interest rates are mostly
offset in our projection by a downward revision to house prices. With respect to our
fiscal assumptions, we have marked down the projected trajectory of defense spending
over the medium term. As a result, real GDP is projected to increase 2 percent in 2012,
about ¼ percentage point less than in the December Tealbook, and 2½ percent in 2013,
about unchanged from the previous projection. This average pace of growth only slightly
exceeds our estimate of potential. Accordingly, little progress is made in closing the
estimated gap in either the utilization of the workforce or the productive capacity of the
overall economy over the next two years.
The outlook for inflation is about the same as in the December Tealbook. Core
PCE inflation appears to be slowing about as we thought it would based on our

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
o
D
Monetary Policy
In line with the prescription of the outcome-based policy rule, we continue to
assume that the FOMC will hold the target federal funds rate in the current range of 0 to
¼ percent until the fourth quarter of 2014, the same span of time as in the December
Tealbook. We also assume that the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s
current portfolio-related policies.1
Interest Rates
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has decreased about 25 basis points, on
net, since the December Tealbook, reflecting in part a downward revision to the market’s
expected policy path, and we have lowered our projection for the Treasury yield this
round. We still expect that sluggish progress toward resolving the European debt crisis
will continue to result in safe-haven demands for Treasury securities in coming quarters.
Even so, as in previous projections, we expect the 10-year Treasury yield to rise
substantially from the middle of this year through 2013, ending that year at 3½ percent—
about 1½ percentage points above its current level. This projected increase reflects the
movement of the valuation window through the period of near-zero short-term interest
rates, a gradual waning of the effects of nonconventional monetary policy, and an
1 The path of the federal funds rate in the extended baseline projection, and in particular the date
when conventional monetary policy begins to firm, depends importantly on our use of the estimated
outcome-based rule to set policy. If we had instead assumed that the federal funds rate would follow the
prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) rule, liftoff would not begin until late 2015; an inertial version of this
rule would delay the onset of conventional tightening until mid-2016. In contrast, conventional monetary
policy would begin tightening early this year under the Taylor (1993) rule and in mid-2013 under the first-
difference rule. These various prescriptions make no adjustment for the stimulus provided by the Federal
Reserve’s nonconventional policy actions; if they did, the prescribed dates for tightening would be pulled
forward. However, in most cases, the advance in timing would be modest because the staff projects the
downward pressure on term premiums from the SOMA portfolio to diminish appreciably over the next few
years.

O
eventually abate and the U.S. economic recovery gains a firmer footing.
&
l
e
v
e Spreads on BBB-rated corporate bonds and conforming fixed-rate mortgages have
D
n widened a touch, on net, since the December Tealbook. These spreads are currently well
o
c
E above their typical levels, and, as in previous forecasts, we expect them to narrow
c
i
t gradually over the medium term. However, given the outlook for limited progress in
s
e
m
resolving the European situation in the near term, both spreads are expected to be roughly
o
D
flat through the first half of this year before narrowing further out. Coupled with our
forecast for Treasury rates, these assumptions imply a moderate increase in yields on
these private instruments over the next two years.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have increased about 3 percent, on net, since the
December Tealbook. We project that stock prices will be about flat over the first half of
this year and then move up rapidly in the second half of 2012 and in 2013, as investors
gain confidence that European authorities will make progress toward resolving their
fiscal and financial crisis. On the current projection, the equity premium will descend
somewhat from its current extraordinarily high level.
According to the latest data, home prices in November declined more than we
expected. We reacted by reducing the level of home prices by about 1 percent throughout
the projection period. Our forecast calls for the CoreLogic Home Price Index to decrease
a bit more than 1 percent in 2012 and to be about unchanged in 2013.
Fiscal Policy
We have scaled back our projection for defense spending over the medium term.
The spend-out of defense appropriations over the past year has persistently fallen short of
our expectations. Even more important, recent information indicates that appropriations
for overseas military operations will be smaller than we had previously expected. Our
other fiscal policy assumptions are unchanged. In particular, we assume that the
2 percentage point payroll tax reduction for employees and the Emergency
Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program—both of which were recently extended
through the end of February—will soon be extended through the end of this year. We
also continue to assume that discretionary spending will be restrained by the caps set in
the Budget Control Act. In addition, although we assume that the Congress will not

allow the spending sequester triggered by the failure of the supercommittee last autumn u t
O
to take full effect in 2013, we expect that other, more gradual budget-saving measures
&
will be enacted to achieve the same $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over the fiscal 2013– e l
v
e
21 period. D
n
o
c
Given our revised assumptions, we now expect federal fiscal policy to impose E
c
i
restraint of 0.4 percentage point on the growth of real GDP in 2012 (excluding multiplier t
s
e
m
effects), 0.1 percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook. In 2013, federal fiscal
o
policy is still anticipated to impose a drag of about 1 percentage point.2 D
We project the budget deficit to narrow from $1.3 trillion (8½ percent of GDP) in
fiscal year 2011 to $1.1 trillion (7 percent of GDP) and $850 billion (5¼ percent of GDP)
in fiscal 2012 and 2013, respectively. As in the December Tealbook, the narrowing of
the deficit primarily reflects the assumed tightening of fiscal policy.
Foreign Activity and the Dollar
Incoming data indicate that foreign economic activity decelerated substantially in
the fourth quarter, and by a little more than we had expected. In particular, we now
estimate that aggregate real GDP growth in the foreign economies stepped down from an
annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter to 2 percent last quarter, the latter figure
being about ¼ percentage point lower than we projected in the December Tealbook. Our
overall foreign outlook is little changed from the December Tealbook; real GDP is
projected to rise 2½ percent this year and 3 percent in 2013. We continue to believe that
with a quick resolution to the euro-area crisis unlikely to materialize, financial tensions
will persist for some time and lead to an appreciable contraction of GDP in the euro area
this year, restraining the pace of global economic activity.
Since the time of the December Tealbook, the dollar has appreciated against the
euro and has changed little, on net, against most other currencies, leaving the broad real
dollar about 1 percent higher than we had assumed in December. From this higher
starting point we project the broad real dollar to depreciate 1¾ percent in 2012 and
3 percent in 2013, with these declines concentrated against the emerging market
2 If the payroll tax reduction and EUC benefits are not extended beyond February, then the
restraint from federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth this year would be 0.5 percentage point greater.
With the earlier expiration of these policies, the drag from fiscal policy on real GDP growth in 2013 would
be 0.35 percentage point less.

Oil and Other Commodity Prices e
D
n
Global oil markets have been buffeted by a number of conflicting developments o
c
in recent weeks. Spot prices for most grades of oil are little changed, as greater concern E
c
i
over global growth prospects has largely balanced increased fears of potential supply s t
e
m
disruptions, particularly heightened tensions over Iran’s nuclear development program.
o
D
The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed at $100 per barrel on
January 17, about the same as at the time of the December Tealbook. In contrast to spot
prices, WTI futures prices have risen slightly since the previous Tealbook; as a result, the
futures curve slopes down a bit less steeply. In all, we expect the price of imported oil to
fall modestly from $104 per barrel in the current quarter to $101 per barrel by the end of
2013, about $6 per barrel higher than projected in the December Tealbook. The upward
revision to the forecast importantly reflects higher futures prices for both WTI and
Brent.3 In light of the escalating tensions with Iran, the Risks and Uncertainty section
considers the effects of a significant disruption in global oil supply.
The broad index of nonfuel commodity prices that we follow is, on net, little
changed since the time of the December Tealbook. The prices of field crops, including
corn, soybeans, and wheat, have moved up modestly in recent weeks because of concerns
about growing conditions in Latin America; however, these prices remain well below the
peaks reached in the first half of 2011. Meanwhile, metals prices are little changed, on
net, from the time of the December Tealbook. Overall, we expect nonfuel commodity
prices to increase only slightly through 2013, in line with prices from futures markets
adjusted for staff assumptions regarding the path of the dollar and the global growth
outlook.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
As noted earlier, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of
3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, ¼ percentage point less than in our previous
projection, and that it will rise just 1½ percent in the current quarter, ½ percentage point
3 Additionally, because private economists’ forecasts of global economic activity have moved
down closer to ours, we now expect less downward pressure on oil prices going forward, and we have
raised the adjustment factor we apply to the futures curves.

u t less than before. These downward revisions mostly reflect sharply weaker incoming
O
information on defense spending and a somewhat more moderate pace of increase in
&
e l consumer spending than we had forecast previously. Residential construction, which has
v
e
D shown a few surprising signs of life, provided a small offset to these downward revisions.
n
o Turning to the contour of our projection, the expected deceleration in real GDP growth
c
E
this quarter is shaped most importantly by the pattern of inventory investment, which is
c
i
t
s estimated to have contributed more than 1½ percentage points to real GDP growth last
e
m
o quarter but is expected to be about neutral in the current quarter.
D
The Labor Market
Labor market conditions have firmed somewhat recently. Total nonfarm payroll
employment increased 200,000 and private nonfarm payroll employment gained 212,000
in December—both somewhat faster than in recent months—and the unemployment rate
edged down 0.2 percentage point in December to 8.5 percent.4 Other labor market
indicators have also shown some improvement: Initial claims for unemployment
insurance have, on net, continued to move down, households upgraded their expectations
of future labor market conditions after having tamped them down during the summer, and
firms report that they expect to step up their rate of hiring in the first quarter.
Nonetheless, these indicators have improved less than generally would be consistent with
the decline in the unemployment rate over the past four months.
In light of this information and the weaker output growth that we have in this
projection, we have marked up our near-term labor market forecast only slightly. In
particular, we now expect that private payroll gains will average 150,000 per month in
the first quarter; this figure is about 10,000 per month stronger than in the December
Tealbook after adjusting for the anticipated payback in January from the overstated
December gain. With state and local governments expected to make further cuts to
payrolls in response to budget pressures, total payroll employment is expected to increase
about 125,000 per month through March. We expect the unemployment rate to edge
back up to 8.7 percent in the first quarter, a touch below our projection in the December
Tealbook.
4 As we saw last year, the rise in payroll employment in December seems to have been
exaggerated to some degree by a temporary increase in hiring by package delivery firms due to online
retailing, which—as a relatively recent phenomenon—is probably not yet fully captured in the BLS’s
seasonal adjustment procedure. We expect the payroll gain in January to be held down somewhat in
seasonally adjusted terms as those workers are laid off.

The Industrial Sector u t
O
Manufacturing production posted a solid gain in the fourth quarter. While a &
l
portion of this strength reflected the continued recovery in the motor vehicle supply chain e
v
e
from last year’s earthquake in Japan and the more recent flooding in Thailand, recent D
n
production gains outside the motor vehicle sector also have been relatively firm. After o
c
E
jumping nearly 1 percent in December, manufacturing output appears poised to c
i
t
decelerate in coming months, in part as the temporary boost to factory output resulting e s
m
from the recovery of the motor vehicle supply chain wanes. Indeed, although the o
D
available indicators of near-term production changes—such as the new-orders diffusion
indexes from the national and regional manufacturing surveys—have improved in recent
months, they continue to suggest near-term gains in factory output that are a bit less rapid
than those we have seen since the summer. Nevertheless, after factoring in the strong
increase in IP for December, manufacturing output is now expected to rise at an annual
rate of 4 percent this quarter, 1¼ percentage points stronger than in the previous
Tealbook.
Household Spending
Real PCE appears to have increased at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter.
Sales of light motor vehicles rose to an annual rate of 13½ million units last quarter,
1 million units higher than in the third quarter when supply constraints related to the
earthquake in Japan were still limiting sales to some degree. However, the increase in
spending on goods other than motor vehicles was more moderate, and the available data
suggest that spending on services has been somewhat restrained.
If, as in our baseline projection, energy prices are stable in coming months and the
payroll tax cut is extended through the end of this year, then the job gains that we
anticipate should show through to a moderate increase in real disposable income over the
near term. Nevertheless, households’ expectations regarding their future incomes remain
bleak, and consumer sentiment remains at relatively low levels despite having improved
noticeably over the past several months. All told, we now estimate that real PCE rose
2¼ percent in the fourth quarter and look for a 2 percent increase in the current quarter.
This trajectory is a bit weaker than in our previous projection, reflecting a disappointing
retail sales report for December.
Recent indicators of single-family housing activity—such as starts, permit
issuance, and home sales—hint at incremental increases in demand over the past few

months. However, activity remains at deeply depressed levels, as mortgage credit u t
O
remains restrictive, the stock of vacant homes is still abundant, and credit availability for
&
builders continues to be tight. Accordingly, while we have taken on board the modestly e l
v
e
better news in this sector and have raised our projection for homebuilding a bit, we still D
n
expect single-family starts to edge up in the first quarter only to an average annual rate o
c
E
approaching 450,000 units. In response to increased demand for apartments and falling
c
i
t
vacancy rates, multifamily starts have slowly risen from very low levels over the past s
e
m
year or so, and we expect further moderate gains in coming months. o
D
Business Investment
Real business spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to have risen at
an annual rate of only 3 percent in the fourth quarter after posting a sizable gain of
16 percent in the third quarter. Although spending on high-tech equipment has held up
reasonably well in recent months, spending on a broad range of other equipment appears
to have pulled back in the fourth quarter after a third-quarter surge. Forward-looking
indicators are mixed: Some indicators of business sentiment and of capital spending
plans have improved lately, but corporate bond spreads remain elevated and analysts’
earnings expectations for producers of capital goods remain subdued. As a result, we
expect E&S spending to rise at only a 2 percent pace in the current quarter, similar to the
previous quarter’s pace.
After two quarters of surprisingly large increases, real investment in
nonresidential structures appears to have decelerated sharply in the fourth quarter and is
expected to decline in the current quarter.5 The architectural billings index—which is
reasonably well correlated with changes in outlays two to three quarters hence—has
moved up recently but remains consistent with near-term decreases in spending outside
the drilling and mining sector. In contrast, we continue to expect activity in the drilling
and mining sector to rise at robust rates over the next few quarters, supported by the high
price of crude oil and by the ongoing diffusion of technologies that have increased the
expected profitability of drilling.
Real inventory investment in the nonfarm business sector looks to have picked up
noticeably in the fourth quarter—contributing more than 1½ percentage points to the rise in
5 Outside of drilling and mining, activity likely would have fallen quite noticeably at the end of
last year if not for an expiring tax provision for alternative energy projects that probably pulled some
spending from early this year into the fourth quarter.

generally appear well aligned with sales. One exception is in motor vehicles, where
&

Incoming data suggest that total real federal purchases fell at an annual rate of
o
D
nearly 10 percent in the fourth quarter, pulled down by defense spending that proved
much weaker than we had expected. Given our revised assumptions for defense
spending, we now anticipate that real federal purchases will only edge up this quarter;
previously, we expected a 4 percent rate of increase. Meanwhile, data for the state and
local sector continue to suggest that the rate of decline in real purchases is moderating.
Over the second half of 2011, state and local employment declined 11,000 jobs per
month, on average, compared with decreases of roughly 30,000 per month over the first
half of the year. Moreover, real construction expenditures appear to have leveled out in
the second half of 2011 following sharp decreases in the first half of the year. As in our
previous projection, we continue to expect that real purchases by state and local
governments will decline at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the fourth and first
quarters.
Foreign Trade
After incorporating the trade data for October and November, we estimate that
real exports of goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter.
In the current quarter we expect exports to increase at a similar pace, supported by
continued growth in the emerging market economies and by the lagged effect of the
declines in the dollar that occurred in the first half of 2011. Real imports of goods and
services are estimated to have increased 3 percent in the fourth quarter and are projected
to rise at a 4 percent pace in the current quarter as imports of oil pick up following a flat
fourth quarter. Given the relative strength of exports, we expect the contribution of net
exports to U.S. GDP growth to be about ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter and to
be slightly positive in the current quarter, a forecast largely unchanged from the
December Tealbook.

Prices and Wages u t
O
Recent data on consumer prices have been mostly in line with our December &
l
forecast. With regard to core inflation, the latest readings continue to suggest that the e
v
e
upswing in the spring and summer was mainly due to transitory factors, including the D
n
first-half surge in commodity and import prices as well as the increase in motor vehicle o
c
E
prices that stemmed from supply shortages related to the earthquake in Japan. Indeed, c
i
t
prices for motor vehicles declined again in November. In addition, core prices in the e s
m
fourth quarter were held down by two temporary factors—a decline in nonmarket prices o
D
from which we take little signal, and a weak reading on prices for medical services that
appears unlikely to persist. All told, we continue to expect core PCE prices to rise at an
annual rate of about 1 percent in the fourth quarter and to increase 1½ percent this
quarter.
Consumer food prices look to have decelerated a bit more than we anticipated in
the fourth quarter, and we expect food price increases to slow further over the first half of
this year, as the declines in crop prices since last spring continue to pass through to retail
prices. Meanwhile, our forecast for consumer energy prices—a sharp decline in the
fourth quarter and little change in the current quarter—is largely unrevised relative to the
previous projection. All told, total PCE price inflation appears on track to slow from an
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the third quarter to ½ percent in the fourth, a bit below our
previous projection, and then to step back up to 1½ percent in the first quarter.
We have received little new information on labor compensation since the
December Tealbook. Employee compensation in November was lower than anticipated,
but average hourly earnings in December were stronger than expected. As a result, we
continue to estimate that compensation per hour advanced at an annual rate of 2¼ percent
in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to increase at the same rate in the current quarter.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
Our medium-term forecast for the growth of real GDP is a little weaker than at the
time of the December Tealbook. This change primarily reflects a higher projected
foreign exchange value for the dollar, a little higher path for oil prices, and a weaker
trajectory for defense spending. The other factors shaping the broad contour of our
projection are largely the same as in the previous projection. In particular, as before,
developments in Europe are expected to cast a pall over the U.S. economy during the first
half of this year; thereafter, Europe-related concerns are assumed to abate gradually.

Similarly, the adverse effects of impaired credit availability are anticipated to ebb slowly u t
O
during the next two years, leading to further increases in consumer and business
&
confidence and causing households and businesses eventually to become more responsive e l
v
e
to the low level of interest rates. In contrast, federal fiscal policy is expected to become D
n
substantially more restrictive over time, curtailing the growth rate of real GDP by a full o
c
E
percentage point in 2013. Moreover, as discussed earlier, we project a substantial rise in
c
i
t
long-term interest rates through the end of next year. In all, real GDP is expected to s
e
m
increase 2 percent in 2012 and 2½ percent in 2013, the same pace as the assumed rate of o
D
growth in potential output this year and a little faster than potential growth next year.
As noted earlier, the path for the dollar is a little higher in this projection.
Accordingly, we trimmed our outlook for export growth. Nevertheless, we think that
continued increases in demand from the emerging market economies will support gains in
U.S. exports overall. As a result, real exports of goods and services are expected to rise
about 5 percent in both 2012 and 2013, about ¼ percentage point slower in each year than
in the previous projection. Meanwhile, real imports are forecast to increase at a modest
4 percent annual rate, on average, this year and next, consistent with the relatively
lackluster pace of U.S. GDP growth. On net, because imports still exceed exports, trade
is expected to make an essentially zero arithmetic contribution to real GDP growth over
the next two years, a slightly weaker forecast than in the December Tealbook.
We also have increased the projected drag from government spending over the
medium term relative to that in our previous forecast. As before, we expect federal
discretionary spending to be restrained by the Budget Control Act. But, as discussed
earlier in “Key Background Factors,” we now think that appropriations for overseas
military operations will be smaller than we had previously expected, and we have
tempered the anticipated rebound in defense spending this year from the surprisingly low
level of spending relative to appropriations in 2011. As a result, we now expect real
federal purchases to fall 1 percent in 2012 and 4 percent in 2013, a bit more than in the
December Tealbook. In the state and local sector, we continue to see an anemic recovery
in real purchases. Although state tax revenues are rising at a solid pace, federal stimulus
grants are being phased out and tax collections (especially property taxes) at the local
level have been weak. In this tight fiscal environment, we expect state and local
purchases to change little, on net, over the projection period.

The other factors influencing our medium-term projection are mostly unrevised. u t
O
As we noted in the previous Tealbook, the news during the past several months about real
&
disposable personal income (DPI) has been very weak. Although we have taken down e l
v
e
the trajectory of consumer spending in response to that news, we have not done so to the D
n
full extent called for by a mechanical reading of our models. The box “The Role of o
c
E
Surprisingly Weak Income Data in the PCE Projection” provides our rationale for
c
i
t
tempering our response to the income data. All told, we continue to expect spending to s
e
m
accelerate in 2012 as the growth in real DPI steps back up and as consumers become o
D
more confident about the economic outlook.
As before, we expect a very slow recovery in the housing sector over the medium
term. The recent data on starts, permits, and new home sales have been slightly
encouraging. However, access to mortgage credit is still exceedingly tight, and
households remain pessimistic and uncertain about their future incomes and about the
direction of house prices; these factors are likely to weigh on the demand for housing for
some time. Moreover, the stock of vacant houses remains sizable, and the flow of homes
from foreclosure into the resale market is expected to remain substantial. Accordingly,
our projection calls for single-family housing starts to rise only gradually to an annual
rate of 560,000 units by the end of 2013, a pace we judge to be far below the longer-run
demand for housing.
In the business sector, we have not materially changed our view of the way E&S
investment is progressing. In particular, we continue to view many firms as being
hesitant to invest despite having the cash to do so. As firms grow more confident about
the economic outlook and as financing conditions for smaller businesses improve further,
we expect business spending to accelerate somewhat. As a result, growth in real E&S
outlays is projected to step up from about 4 percent in 2012 to about 6½ percent in 2013;
these moderate rates of increase are consistent with only a slow expansion of the capital
stock.
Our outlook for business investment in nonresidential structures remains sluggish.
Outside of drilling and mining, investment is expected to be essentially flat, on net, over
the next two years, reflecting the weak fundamentals for this sector: Vacancy rates are
still elevated, valuations for commercial real estate remain depressed, and financing
conditions continue to be difficult. In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining structures
are anticipated to persist at high levels over the projection period, although spending

The Role of Surprisingly Weak Income Data in the PCE Projection
&
l
e
v
e Real disposable personal income (DPI) has been considerably weaker than we had
D
expected in the fall. Indeed, real DPI now looks to have edged up just $40 billion (or
n
o ½ percent) over 2011; at the time of the October Tealbook, we anticipated an increase of
c
E close to $160 billion (or 1½ percent), as shown in the table below.1 The meager gains in
c
i personal income—which are also reflected in the very subdued increases in gross
t
s
e domestic income (GDI) over the second and third quarters—have weighed on our
m
o projection of consumer spending for this year and next.
D
Despite the slow growth in real disposable income, consumption expenditures in the
second half of last year seem to have held up reasonably well, and, as a result, the
personal saving rate fell from 5 percent in the first half of the year to around 4 percent in
the second half—a decline that seems out of line with the weaker consumer sentiment
and lower household wealth over the same period.
The Board staff’s preferred consumption models react to the relatively high level of
consumption (given the level of income and other determinants)—and hence the
relatively low saving rate—by projecting that future consumption growth will slow
enough to bring the level of consumption back in line with income and other observable
explanatory variables. In other words, the models imply that surprises in the saving rate
are unwound subsequently. The implications of one such model are shown by the blue
bars in the figure on the facing page: According to this model, the downward revisions to
income over the past two Tealbooks imply, all else being equal, reductions in the growth
rate of PCE of close to ½ percentage point in 2012 and about ¼ percentage point in 2013.
In the baseline forecast, we have discounted somewhat the implications of this and
similar models for the PCE outlook for the following reasons. For one thing, real‐time
readings on spending and income are subject to considerable measurement error. One
interpretation of the relative strength of consumption recently is that the currently
published data may understate the actual level of disposable income. (Indeed, the
deceleration in published compensation in the middle of the year seems out of step with

u
the stability in both employment growth and the unemployment rate observed over the O
same period.) Moreover, during the past decade, there has been some tendency for &
l
large income revisions in a quarter—such as the recent downward revision to second‐ e
v
e
quarter compensation—to be partially unwound subsequently. To the extent that the D
currently published estimates of income are too low, the outlook for consumption should n

be brighter than a mechanical reading of the model results would indicate. Similarly, c

current estimates of consumption may be too high, in which case the level of actual c

e
there would be less reason to project a slower growth rate of consumption going m
o
forward.2 D
Even if income and consumer spending were measured without error, a standard PCE
model might still overstate the implications of the current estimated imbalance between
consumption and income for future consumption growth because these apparent
imbalances may instead reflect factors or behavior that the model does not capture. For
example, changes in credit conditions, income uncertainty, or the proportion of current
income that is perceived to be transitory could all have important influences on the
saving rate. However, because we cannot accurately observe or estimate these
variables, the ability of our models to condition on them is very limited.
After weighing the various interpretations of the recent income data, we revised down
our projection of consumption growth from the October Tealbook to the January
Tealbook (the red bars in the figure below) by a little less than our preferred model
would have suggested (the blue bars).

AGGREGATE SUPPLY, THE LABOR MARKET, AND INFLATION D
Potential GDP and the NAIRU
We have made no changes in this projection to our estimates of aggregate supply.
We continue to assume that potential GDP will increase roughly 2 percent in both 2012
and 2013, and we have retained our assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent
through 2013.6
Productivity and the Labor Market
With output growth coming in a little weaker than we had expected even as the
labor market has improved by more than we had anticipated, we have marked down our
estimates of the increase in productivity in the near term. These revisions have brought
the level of productivity down to our estimate of its trend level more quickly than we had
anticipated in the December Tealbook. Over the remainder of the medium-term
projection period, we expect firms to increase their labor input about in step with the
modest gains anticipated in output; thus, we look for productivity to rise at a pace similar
to its trend rate.
With little acceleration in economic activity projected over the medium term, we
expect the pace of private employment growth to hold fairly steady, with monthly job
gains averaging 160,000 in 2012 and 170,000 in 2013. Meanwhile, we expect state and
local employment to continue to decline this year, though by less than in recent years,
and to rise modestly next year, as budget pressures diminish somewhat. With these tepid
employment gains, the unemployment rate edges down to 8¼ percent by the end of 2013,
6 Our estimate of the short-run “effective” NAIRU (which includes the influence of extended and
emergency unemployment benefits) is also unrevised in this projection. It remains at 6.4 percent through
the end of 2012 and then declines toward the long-run NAIRU, nearly closing the gap between the two
measures by the end of 2013 when the extended unemployment benefits are almost fully wound down.

By our estimates, economic slack remains considerable, and we expect no o
c
material progress to be made in whittling it down over the projection period. For E
c
i
example, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 2¼ percentage points s t
e
m
above our estimate of the effective NAIRU, and we expect this gap to persist through
o
D
2013. Similarly, the output gap is projected to remain wide throughout the medium-term
projection. The extended period of labor market slack is likely to be associated with a
continuation of other adverse labor market conditions, including below-trend labor force
participation and an unusually large concentration of workers experiencing long-term
unemployment spells.
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly reflects trends in the
labor force, our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of
plants to produce with the equipment that is in place and ready to operate, and not on the
potential workforce. As a result, with manufacturing output rising moderately over the
projection period and with manufacturing capacity expanding only modestly (after having
contracted outright during the recession), excess capacity in this sector is taken up
relatively quickly. Indeed, the factory operating rate rises 2¾ percentage points over the
course of the next two years, to 78¼ percent, just a bit below its long-run average.
Prices and Compensation
We expect that the wide margin of labor market slack, along with low rates of
price inflation, will continue to restrain labor costs over the forecast period. Both the
Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation and the employment cost
index are projected to rise about 2¼ percent per year in 2012 and 2013, unchanged from
the December Tealbook. Combined with the moderate gains in productivity that we
project, these increases in compensation imply only a small rise in unit labor costs this
year and next.
After falling at an estimated annual rate of ¾ percent in the final quarter of 2011,
prices for core imported goods are expected to decline at a 1¼ percent rate in the current
quarter; this decrease is slightly larger than projected in the December Tealbook because
of the recent appreciation of the dollar. These price declines stand in sharp contrast to the

sizable increases observed in the first half of 2011; both the earlier increase and the u t

recent declines were driven largely by fluctuations in commodity prices. Core import

D
the middle of last year; the 5-to-10-year expectations stand near the lower edge of the
narrow range they have moved in for most of the past 10 years. Inflation compensation
5 to 10 years ahead derived from TIPS spreads has changed little, on net, in recent weeks.
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that subdued labor costs and low levels
of resource utilization will continue to restrain core PCE inflation over the projection
period but that stable inflation expectations will head off any actual disinflation. We
continue to project that core PCE inflation will be about 1½ percent in both 2012 and
2013, the same as in the December Tealbook. Given our forecast of relatively small
changes in food and energy prices, headline inflation is expected to run just a bit below
core in both 2012 and 2013.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff forecast to 2016 using the FRB/US model and staff
assumptions regarding long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.
The contour of the long-run outlook depends on the following key assumptions:
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run,
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by
FOMC participants at the November meeting.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities follow the baseline portfolio
projections reported in Book B. The projected longer-run decline in the
System’s holdings is forecast to contribute about 30 basis points to the rise in
the 10-year Treasury yield from 2013 to 2016.
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decline gradually to normal
levels, and banks ease their lending standards somewhat further.

o
from 2014 through 2016, slightly above its trend rate. D
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in late 2013 to 5½ percent in late 2016
as the functioning of the labor market gradually improves, and settles in at
5¼ percent in the long run. Potential GDP expands 2½ percent per year on
average from 2014 to 2016.
The economy enters 2014 with output still considerably below its potential, the
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed
objective. In the long-run forecast, improving confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and
supportive financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of
3¾ percent from 2014 to 2016. With actual output expanding significantly faster than
potential, labor market conditions improve markedly. Nevertheless, the unemployment
rate is 6½ percent at the end of 2016, still 1 percentage point above the assumed NAIRU.
With slack-related downward pressures gradually abating, inflation edges up slightly but
is still around 1½ percent in 2016.
Relative to the November projection—the last time that Committee participants
submitted economic projections as part of the SEP process—the staff forecast for
unemployment at the end of 2014, at 7.8 percent, is revised up ½ percentage point. Half
of this revision reflects a change in our assumption about the pace at which labor market
functioning will improve over the next several years. (We still have the long-term
NAIRU heading ultimately to 5¼ percent, but getting there more slowly; as a result, the
NAIRU in 2014 is ¼ percentage point higher now than it was in the November
projection. This revision was introduced between the November and December
Tealbooks.) The other half of the upward revision to the unemployment rate in the fourth
quarter of 2014 reflects our expectation that the economic recovery will proceed at a
slower pace than we anticipated in November. The inflation projection for both core and
topline PCE inflation in 2014 is largely unrevised relative to the November Tealbook.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Incoming data point to a substantial deceleration of foreign economic activity
during the last quarter. We now estimate that economic growth abroad stepped down
from an annual pace of 3½ percent in the third quarter to 2 percent in the fourth, a bit
lower than projected in the December Tealbook. This slowdown reflects a number of
factors. First, economic growth in several of our key trading partners—Canada, China,
Japan, and Mexico—had been running unusually fast in the third quarter and some
slowing was anticipated. Second, financial stresses and fiscal consolidation appear to be
k
o
pushing the euro area into recession. Third, the weakness in the euro area has spilled o
l
t
u
over to the United Kingdom and contributed to lower external demand in a number of O
other economies. Finally, the floods in Thailand led to an even deeper plunge in activity &
l
e
in that country than we anticipated and also restrained activity in some other Asian v
e
D
economies through supply chain linkages.
n
o
c
E
Our outlook for foreign activity over the next two years is little changed, with l
’
t
n
aggregate growth abroad projected to be only 2½ percent this year—a pace well below I
trend—and then 3 percent in 2013. The contour of our outlook represents a combination
of rather different trajectories across different regions of the world. In emerging Asia,
Chinese growth remains at about 8 percent and growth in the rest of the region returns to
a near-trend pace as the adverse effects of the floods in Thailand abate. Economic
growth in Latin America should also stay reasonably solid this year and next.
Conversely, in the euro area, we continue to believe that substantial obstacles remain to a
quick resolution of the crisis, and we see output contracting through the end of the year,
with only a meager recovery in train next year.
To be sure, the tone of European financial conditions appears to have improved
somewhat since the time of the December Tealbook, with short-term funding pressures
having eased and sovereign bond spreads for peripheral economies having declined, at
least for shorter maturities. Even S&P’s sovereign debt downgrades for several euro-area
economies, announced a few days ago, had little adverse effect, suggesting that these
downgrades had largely been priced in. Nevertheless, European financial markets remain
stressed, and the cumulative effect of the crisis on credit extension and confidence will

progress has been made to strengthen the firewalls needed to protect embattled European
governments from a renewed run on their debt. Thus, a further deterioration of financial
conditions in the region remains likely, not least because talks on Greek debt
restructuring have so far failed to reach agreement, and we still do not see investor
confidence starting to return until later this year after policymakers are forced to take
stronger actions. Moreover, there remains some chance that financial conditions could
deteriorate much more severely than we anticipate in our baseline projection. (See the
“European Crisis with Severe Spillovers” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.)
Inflation abroad held steady at an annual rate of a little more than 3 percent in the
k
o
fourth quarter. This estimate is a bit lower than projected in the December Tealbook,
o
l
t
u largely reflecting a faster abatement of food price pressures in emerging market
O
& economies (EMEs), particularly in China. We expect foreign inflation to moderate
l
e further this year and next, to about 2¼ percent, as resource slack persists and as price
v
e
D pressures from previous increases in commodity prices continue to diminish. Since the
n
o time of the December Tealbook, most central banks left policy rates unchanged while the
c
E
l ECB and the Central Bank of Chile loosened monetary policy. In several foreign
’
t
n
I economies, further policy easing is expected.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
We now estimate that real GDP in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rose at
an annual pace of only about ½ percent in the fourth quarter, nearly ½ percentage point
less than projected in the December Tealbook. In Japan and the United Kingdom,
activity surprised on the downside; Japanese exports continued to fall and U.K. consumer
and business confidence dipped to levels not seen since 2009. In the euro area, incoming
data support our view that the region has entered a moderate recession. But the Canadian
economy seems to be holding up better. Going forward, we continue to expect AFE
growth to remain a lackluster ½ percent in the first half of 2012, held down by the euro-
area recession, before picking up to a 1¾ percent pace by the end of 2013.
Headline inflation in the AFEs is estimated to have risen to an annual rate of
2¾ percent in the fourth quarter from a rate of 1 percent in the third. The acceleration in
prices, which we had anticipated in the December forecast, largely reflected a series of
temporary factors, which started unwinding toward the end of last year. Accordingly, we
project that inflation will slow to 1½ percent in the first quarter and, reflecting persistent
and substantial output gaps, average about 1¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2012
period. This forecast is a touch higher than projected in the previous Tealbook, reflecting
a somewhat more elevated path for energy prices. Amid weak growth prospects and
moderating inflation, we expect that the major foreign central banks will take additional
measures to ease monetary policy conditions.
Euro Area
Recent indicators lead us to estimate that euro-area real GDP contracted at an
annual rate of 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, a bit more than expected in the December
Tealbook. Preliminary indications are that German GDP contracted at nearly a 1 percent
pace. More broadly, euro-area retail trade and industrial production fell further in
k
o
November, and the unemployment rate, at 10.3 percent, remains at its highest level since o
l
t
June 1998. In December, economic sentiment edged down and the composite PMI u
O
stayed in contractionary territory, although the latter improved relative to previous &
l
e
months. However, we slightly reduced the magnitude of the projected contraction in v
e
D
2012, as the recent depreciation of the euro is expected to boost euro-area exports. We
n
now expect GDP to fall 1¼ percent in 2012, about ¼ percentage point less than o
c
E
previously anticipated, before increasing at a still-weak ½ percent pace in 2013. l
’
t
n
I
Euro-area headline inflation spiked to an annual rate of about 4 percent in the
fourth quarter from just 1¼ percent in the third, with the largest increases in categories
most affected by a recent change in seasonal adjustment procedures. However, inflation
in other categories remained subdued. Amid sizable resource slack, we expect inflation
to come in just over 1½ percent this year and fall a bit further, to 1¼ percent, in 2013. At
its December 8 meeting, the ECB cut its benchmark policy rate to 1 percent, lowered the
required reserve ratio from 2 percent to 1 percent, eased collateral requirements for
refinancing operations, and announced three-year longer-term refinancing operations for
December 21 and February 29. At its January 12 meeting, the ECB left policy rates
unchanged. We continue to expect that the ECB will keep its benchmark policy rate at
1 percent over the forecast period and provide significant liquidity support to banks,
resulting in very low short-term market interest rates.
The ECB’s actions in December contributed to the relative calm seen in European
financial markets over the past month (see further details in the Financial Developments
section). However, beyond the ECB’s actions, EU leaders so far have done little to flesh
out the policy measures announced in early December, which included strengthening
fiscal rules and coordination, augmenting IMF resources, and introducing the permanent

backstop facility, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in mid-2012, about a year
earlier than originally planned.1 Euro-area finance ministers have committed
€150 billion in new bilateral loans to augment IMF resources, but it is unclear what other
countries will contribute and how the IMF will handle the new resources. The ESM
appears on track for introduction by midyear, but that will do little to expand EU
financial backstops given the €500 billion combined ceiling on the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) and the ESM; so far, German officials have resisted raising that
ceiling. In response to concerns about policy weaknesses, in mid-January S&P
downgraded the sovereign debt ratings of Austria, France, several other European
countries, and the EFSF, further weakening the firewall intended to contain financial
k
o
o contagion.
l
t
u
O
& We assume that, in the absence of an effective firewall, any number of adverse
l
e shocks will cause financial conditions in the euro area to start deteriorating again. One
v
e
D near-term source of risk is the contentious negotiations between the Greek government
n
o and its creditors over the “voluntary” write-down of Greek debt; should these talks fail to
c
E
l result in an agreement, additional EU–IMF funding could be jeopardized, raising the
’
t
n
I likelihood of a disorderly default. We anticipate that a further steep deterioration in
market conditions would force policymakers to eventually overcome domestic political
constraints and take more aggressive actions to stabilize the situation, but that investor
confidence would be restored only gradually thereafter.
Japan
Real GDP growth in Japan is estimated to have declined sharply from an annual
rate of 5½ percent in the third quarter to just ½ percent in the fourth. Much of this
slowdown was anticipated in the December Tealbook, reflecting the waning of the
rebound from the March earthquake and tsunami, the effects on parts supplies of the
floods in Thailand, and the appreciation of the yen. However, incoming data on
household spending and exports point to a sharper slowdown than we had anticipated, in
part because of a bigger effect from the floods than we had previously built in. As a
result, we lowered our fourth-quarter growth estimate by 1½ percentage points. We
project that real GDP growth will rebound to 2¾ percent in the current quarter, somewhat
1 The ESM, which was originally intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility on
its expiration in 2013, is designed to channel liquidity to euro-area governments whose access to market
financing is impaired.

higher than in the December Tealbook. Beyond the first quarter, growth should average
roughly 1½ percent through the end of 2013.
As expected, prices resumed their decline in November, supporting our estimate
that inflation was negative ½ percent in the fourth quarter. We project deflation to persist
amid sizable output gaps. Given the weak outlook for both output and inflation, we
anticipate that the Bank of Japan will further expand the size of its asset purchase
program. With the budget deficit projected to rise to nearly 9 percent of GDP this year,
the Noda administration is pushing for a hike in the value-added tax (VAT) to begin
restoring fiscal sustainability, although we do not assume such a hike over the forecast
k
period. o
o
l
t
u
O
United Kingdom
&
In the United Kingdom, recent data on activity have been markedly weak, e l
v
e
prompting us to lower our estimate for fourth-quarter real GDP growth by ¾ percentage D
n
point to negative ¼ percent. In November, industrial production continued to decline and o
c
E
retail sales edged down. In addition, indicators of consumer and business confidence fell
l
’
t
further. However, both the manufacturing and services PMIs moved up in December, n
I
suggesting that conditions improved toward year-end, and as a result, we carried forward
only part of the fourth-quarter weakness. Even so, we now project that U.K. real GDP
will rise only ½ percent in 2012, ¼ percentage point less than projected in the December
Tealbook. In 2013, economic growth is projected to strengthen to a 1¾ percent pace, as
financial conditions in Europe improve.
Higher utility prices pushed fourth-quarter inflation up to an annual rate of
4½ percent, a bit more than previously anticipated. However, with energy price inflation
projected to moderate and core inflation already trending down, inflation should step
down to 2 percent in the current quarter. Ample resource slack, along with our
assumption of no further increases in the VAT, should keep inflation at an average of
about 2 percent over the remainder of the forecast period. We continue to expect that the
Bank of England, faced with a bleak outlook and adverse financial spillovers from the
euro area, will increase the target for its asset purchase program from £275 billion to
£400 billion during the first half of 2012.

Canada
We estimate that real GDP growth in Canada stepped down to an annual rate of
2 percent in the fourth quarter after a temporary surge in exports helped boost third-
quarter GDP growth to 3½ percent. Monthly real GDP for October was unchanged from
the previous month, but the manufacturing PMI edged up in December and points to
positive, albeit moderate, growth. We expect GDP growth to hover around 2 percent
over the forecast period, a bit lower than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting the
downward revision to the path of U.S. activity.
We estimate that headline inflation moved up temporarily to an annual rate of
k
o
o 3½ percent in the fourth quarter from only 1 percent in the previous quarter, largely
l
t
u
O reflecting the removal of car price discounts announced last summer. Inflation should
& average 2 percent in 2012 and 1¾ percent in 2013, a touch more than in the December
l
e
v Tealbook given the higher path for oil prices. In view of sizable output gaps and
e
D
moderating inflation, we continue to expect that the Bank of Canada will keep its main
n
o
c policy rate at 1 percent through the end of 2013.
E
l

t
n
I EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
We estimate that real GDP growth in the EMEs stepped down to an annual rate of
3½ percent in the fourth quarter from a 4½ percent pace in the third. This deceleration
reflected a slowdown in both China and Mexico to a more sustainable pace, a weakening
of export demand in Asia, and flooding and related supply chain disruptions in Thailand
and its trading partners. We continue to project an acceleration of EME activity in the
current quarter, to a pace of 4½ percent, partly reflecting recovery from the effect of the
floods in Thailand. Growth is then projected to remain near that rate over the remainder
of the forecast period, with some strengthening in 2013 as the recovery in the advanced
economies gains traction.
Incoming data suggest that headline inflation moderated to an annual rate of
3¼ percent in the fourth quarter; this decline was somewhat more than anticipated at the
time of the December Tealbook and was concentrated in China, where food prices
retreated faster than expected. We continue to project that EME inflation will move
down a bit more as the effects of earlier increases in food prices dissipate further. With
concerns about slowing global growth balanced by worries about currency depreciation,
many EME central banks have kept monetary policy on hold since the December
Tealbook; a notable exception was the Central Bank of Chile, which, despite 12-month
Page 38 of 104

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2012
inflation moving above its target range in December, loosened policy in response to
concerns about domestic economic growth.
China
Chinese real GDP growth declined from 9½ percent in the third quarter to
8¼ percent in the fourth, in line with our forecast in the December Tealbook. Domestic
demand remained robust, with retail sales and fixed-asset investment continuing to grow
at close to their third-quarter pace, but the trade surplus fell sharply as imports rose more
than exports. For the year as a whole, the trade surplus was $155 billion, down from
$182 billion in 2010. Consumption and gross capital formation each contributed about
k
o
half of China’s economic growth of 9 percent in 2011, with net exports exerting a slight o
l
t
drag. Looking forward, we project that Chinese real GDP will continue to grow at about u
O
an 8 percent pace this year and next—somewhat below our estimate of potential—with &
l
e
domestic demand remaining solid but external demand relatively weak. This outlook is v
e
D
little changed from the December projection; we continue to believe that Chinese
n
authorities have sufficient scope for policy action to avoid a hard landing should demand o
c
E
slow by more than we currently anticipate. l
’
t
n
I
Chinese headline consumer price inflation stepped down to 1¾ percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter from 6¼ percent in the third, reflecting a decline in food
prices following large increases earlier in the year. As food prices bottom out, inflation is
expected to hover around 3 percent over the next two years. With inflation beginning to
moderate, Chinese authorities loosened monetary policy in late November by cutting
bank reserve requirements, and bank lending accelerated in December.
Other Emerging Asia
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, we estimate that growth slowed to an annual rate of
only 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, about 1 percentage point lower than we had
projected in the December Tealbook. The slowdown in growth can be primarily
attributed to temporary disruptions to regional supply chains resulting from the October
floods in Thailand, which caused domestic output to plunge even more than we had
projected. In addition, output in Singapore contracted surprisingly sharply because of a
decline in the production of high-tech goods, and external demand was weaker
throughout the region. As output in the region recovers from the floods, growth this year
should pick up to about 4 percent, a bit lower than previously projected owing to weaker
exports, and increase to 4½ percent next year as demand from Europe starts to recover.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2012
Inflation in the region remained at about 3½ percent in the fourth quarter, and we
expect it to edge down to about 3¼ percent for the remainder of the forecast period.
Since the December Tealbook, mounting concerns over the growth outlook have
prompted the Reserve Bank of India to refrain from further tightening of monetary policy
despite persistently high 12-month inflation of about 9 percent.
Latin America
We estimate that Mexican real GDP grew at a 3½ percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, a large step-down from the previous quarter but ½ percentage point higher than
projected in the December Tealbook. Our upward revision reflects better-than-expected
k
o
o U.S. industrial production data. Looking forward, the revised contour of U.S. industrial
l
t
u
O production has led us to increase growth in Mexico in the near term and mark it down
& further out, but these revisions have left average Mexican growth for this year and next
l
e
v about unchanged from the December Tealbook at about 3 percent.
e
D
n
o On balance, growth in South America is estimated to have remained steady at an
c
E
annual rate of 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter. Incoming data suggest that Brazil’s
l
’
t
n
I economy, which stalled in the third quarter, perked up a bit in the fourth, in line with our
expectations. However, this improvement has been offset by a deceleration of activity
elsewhere in South America. Our outlook for the region is little changed from the
December Tealbook, with growth rising to about 3½ percent by next year, as monetary
policy easing supports Brazil’s recovery and the global economy strengthens.
Recent data suggest that headline inflation in Latin America increased to an
annual rate of 5½ percent in the fourth quarter from 3½ percent in the third, in part
because of a weather-related rise in food prices and the removal of an electricity subsidy
in Mexico. We expect these effects to dissipate going forward, which should bring
inflation for the region back down to about 3¾ percent by midyear. Of note, Brazilian
inflation has fallen to the upper bound of 6½ percent of the central bank’s target range,
giving authorities some scope to loosen monetary policy further.

Financial Developments
Conditions in financial markets improved somewhat over the intermeeting period,
with stock prices higher, risk spreads in several markets narrower, and measures of actual
and implied volatility generally down. Nonetheless, with doubts persisting about the
prospects for a durable solution to the European fiscal and banking problems, the
European situation continued to be a central concern for investors. Term Libor–OIS
spreads remained elevated, with dollar funding pressures especially notable for European
banks.
On balance over the period, policy expectations edged down, longer-dated
Treasury yields declined, and inflation compensation was relatively little changed.
Meanwhile, financing conditions for large nonfinancial businesses generally remained
favorable, as net debt financing was strong and C&I lending continued to expand in
December. Credit conditions for households were mixed. Consumer credit increased
robustly in November, but mortgage refinancing activity remained subdued amid tight
lending conditions despite mortgage rates that hovered near record-low levels.
Portfolio-weighted responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on
Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that, in the aggregate, loan demand
s
strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit further in the fourth quarter (see t

beyond decreased 6 to 26 basis points.1 The modal path of expected policy rates derived
from quotes on interest rate caps remained within the current target range through the end
of 2015.
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also
suggested that the respondents had pushed back slightly the expected timing of
tightening. Respondents viewed the third quarter of 2014 as the most likely time for
liftoff of the federal funds rate, one quarter later than indicated in the December survey.
In response to questions about possible options for easing, dealers assigned a 70 percent
probability to the Committee making changes to its forward guidance regarding the
federal funds rate at the January meeting and a 40 percent probability to the Committee
providing guidance on the size of the SOMA portfolio. Many dealers indicated that they
expected the “mid-2013” reference in the FOMC’s statement to be updated or removed
given the publication of FOMC meeting participants’ federal funds rate projections in the
Summary of Economic Projections. Dealers modestly revised down, from 60 percent to
55 percent, the likelihood assigned to an expansion of the SOMA portfolio through
securities purchases within one year.
The decline in the expected path for the federal funds rate was reflected in
Treasury yields, which fell over the intermeeting period, particularly at intermediate and
longer maturities. Staff term-structure models suggest that a narrowing in term premiums s
t
n
also contributed to the move in Treasury yields, consistent with the reduction in long- e
m
p
term interest rate implied volatilities over the period. TIPS- and swaps-based measures o

December, as is typical at that time of the year, but other measures of Treasury market
liquidity remained stable.
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 7 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging 5¼ basis points.
2 As of January 17, 2012, the Desk had sold $162 billion of short-term Treasury securities and
purchased $149 billion of long-term securities under the maturity extension program.

SHORT-TERM DOLLAR FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
U.S. financial institutions reportedly maintained ready access to short-term
funding markets, and there were few signs of dislocations in funding markets over
year-end. European banks continued to face dollar funding pressures, and spreads
between Libor and OIS rates remained elevated; on net over the period, the three-month
Libor–OIS spread widened a touch further while spreads at shorter maturities were little
changed. The spread between the forward rate agreement three to six months ahead and
the corresponding forward OIS rate remained at a relatively high level but narrowed
somewhat, a change that perhaps reflected an expectation for some moderation of these
pressures.
U.S. financial institutions generally continued to issue commercial paper (CP) and
negotiable certificates of deposit on terms typical of noncrisis periods. Outstanding
unsecured CP issued in the United States by entities with European parents declined
somewhat further, but the fraction of issuance by European entities occurring beyond
very short-term maturities moved up a bit. Overnight spreads for unsecured CP issued by
entities with French parents declined substantially following the reduction in the cost of
dollar liquidity provided through central bank swap lines with the Federal Reserve, the
implementation of the ECB’s three-year longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO), and
the passage of year-end. Meanwhile, spreads for issuers with parents from elsewhere in
s
t
n
Europe or the United States remained comparatively low. e
m
p
o
The general collateral repo market has continued to function normally, with no e l
v
e
reports of unusual year-end pressures, and haircuts across collateral types appeared to be D

largely unchanged. Volume in the triparty repo market declined somewhat around a

c
n
year-end but revived in the first two weeks of 2012, buoyed by a pickup in the financing a
n
i
of Treasury securities. Spreads on overnight asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) F
issued by entities with French parents stabilized at a high level, while spreads on
overnight ABCP issued by firms with parents from elsewhere in Europe or the United
States were stable at a low level.
Other indicators provided mixed evidence of strains in the financial system.
Equity prices of most large domestic financial institutions outperformed the broader
market, on net, over the intermeeting period. The initial wave of fourth-quarter earnings
reports for large bank holding companies were mixed relative to market expectations,
with poor capital market revenues weighing on the profits of institutions with significant

trading operations. The CDS spreads of most domestic large bank holding companies
moved notably lower, although they remained at an elevated level. (See the box “Recent
Developments in Counterparty Risk Management.”) Hedge fund valuations declined
again during the intermeeting period. Overall for 2011, the HFRX Global Hedge Fund
Index underperformed the S&P 500 stock index by about 8½ percent, though, on average,
there were no signs of significant outflows from hedge funds.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
During the intermeeting period, international financial markets were calmer than
in previous months, as the financial pressures faced by most European sovereigns and
financial institutions declined somewhat in the wake of ECB policy actions and in the
absence of negative policy news coming out of Europe. However, doubts remained about
the prospects for a durable solution to the European situation. Indeed, late in the period,
difficulties resurfaced in the negotiations over Greek restructuring, and S&P downgraded
the sovereign credit ratings of several euro-area nations.
The ECB’s three-year LTRO, announced a few days before the December FOMC
meeting and implemented in mid-December, contributed to an easing of euro funding
pressures, and overnight interbank euro interest rates declined from about 70 basis points
to about 40 basis points following the LTRO. Euro-area institutions drew almost
s
t
€500 billion in three-year funds while reducing their demand for ECB funding at shorter n
e
m
maturities. On net, the total provision of liquidity by the ECB increased about p
o
€200 billion. On January 4, the ECB allocated $26 billion in its second offering of e l
v
e
three-month dollar funding since the reduction in the cost of dollar liquidity from central D
l
bank swap lines announced in late November. As of January 17, the ECB was providing a
i
c
n
dollar liquidity amounting to a bit more than $80 billion, up from almost $55 billion at a
n
i
the time of the December FOMC meeting. One gauge of dollar funding pressures in the F
euro area, the three-month euro–dollar implied basis spread, dropped about 50 basis
points over the period; it is now 75 basis points lower than its level prior to the late
November swap line announcement, but it remains elevated.
Spreads of yields on 10-year Italian government debt over those on German bunds
were little changed over the intermeeting period, and spreads on Spanish debt declined
40 basis points. Spreads on 2-year Italian and Spanish debt declined roughly 150 basis
points, and both Italy and Spain held successful debt auctions. Although the reasons for

Recent Developments in Counterparty Risk Management
During the past several months, market participants have become more
concerned about the counterparty credit risks posed by financial institutions. For
instance, in the two most recent Senior Credit Officer Opinion Surveys on Dealer
Financing Terms (SCOOS), dealers indicated that they had increased the
resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to
dealers and other financial intermediaries over the previous three months (see
lower‐left figure below). Additionally, in the December SCOOS, most credit
officers reported that their institutions had decreased counterparty credit limits
for specific institutions; they generally pointed to a deterioration in the current or
expected financial strength of other institutions and to increased strains in global
financial markets as the most important reasons for having done so.
Conversations with market participants have provided additional information on
the specific practices used to monitor exposures to financial institutions.
Participants report monitoring indicators of counterparty risk across a range of
distinct business areas—such as OTC derivatives markets, secured funding
markets, and prime brokerage activities—but the procedures employed to
evaluate the overall counterparty risk of other firms vary considerably. Most
market participants report paying close attention to CDS spreads of their
counterparties. Some institutions indicated that spreads of 500 to 600 basis
points are triggers for more active management of exposures, for example
through heightened scrutiny of new trades and more frequent valuation of
s positions. Market participants also report gauging the counterparty credit risk
t
n
e posed by a financial institution based on equity prices or measures of implied
m
volatility in the equity options market. Industry contacts also suggest that
p
o perceptions of counterparty credit risk are quite sensitive to reports that other
l
e
v firms are not willing to accept novation of OTC trades from the institution in
e
D question or that others are seeking to novate trades away from that institution.

In addition to carefully tracking the counterparty credit exposures they
themselves face, major financial intermediaries—keenly aware of the speed with
which confidence can diminish—have also reportedly stepped up their
monitoring of requests from their own counterparties to close out positions,
transfer margin collateral to third parties, and other indicators that would
suggest heightened concerns regarding their own financial condition.
When implementing monetary policy, the Federal Reserve trades Treasury and
agency securities with designated primary dealers, a group of broker–dealers
that includes but is not limited to affiliates of major banks and securities firms
and involves institutions with a range of credit ratings (see lower‐right figure on
the facing page). In recent months, the Federal Reserve has instituted new
procedures to limit counterparty credit risk in its trading with primary dealers. In
particular, the Federal Reserve established margin agreements with primary
dealers on agency MBS forward transactions. These transactions typically settle
one or more months forward, and thus fluctuations over that period in the
market value of the securities purchased could impose costs on the Federal
Reserve if a transaction needed to be replaced following the failure of a
counterparty. In an effort to protect against these price fluctuations, the Federal
Reserve now requires dealers to post an initial margin of 2.5 percent on agency
MBS forward transactions; additional margins are required to be posted or
margin is returned based on daily changes in market values. The margin
requirements are one‐sided—that is, the Federal Reserve is not required to
s
provide collateral in the event that market prices move in the dealers’ favor by t
n
more than the initial margin. Margins were set to cover potential price e
m
movements over a three‐day expected replacement period with a very high p
o
degree of confidence. Margin requirements were initially imposed on MF Global e l
v
as that firm’s financial health worsened but were subsequently extended to all e
D
primary dealers.1

Market values had moved so that the cost to the Federal Reserve to replace the
transactions outstanding with MF Global when it defaulted was higher than the original price
of the transactions. However, the margin posted by MF Global was sufficient to cover this cost
difference.

the declines in spreads are not entirely clear, some market participants attributed them to
the possible use of LTRO funds by banks to purchase shorter-term peripheral debt.
On January 13, S&P lowered the long-term ratings of nine euro-area countries.
France and Austria were downgraded one notch to AA+, and Italy and Spain each
received a two-notch downgrade. Following the sovereign actions, S&P downgraded the
European Financial Stability Facility rating one notch to AA+. Overall market reaction
to the ratings announcements was muted. Similarly, markets shrugged off news that
negotiations over the terms of a voluntary private-sector debt exchange for Greece were
temporarily suspended.
The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar changed little, on net,
over the intermeeting period. However, while the dollar depreciated some against most
other currencies, it appreciated 3½ percent against the euro, likely owing in part to the
deteriorating macroeconomic environment in the euro area and consequent market
expectations for further easing of monetary policy by the ECB.
Foreign stock markets generally ended the period higher. European headline
equity indexes rose 6½ percent, on net, and euro-area banking-sector share prices were
little changed overall. However, shares of Italian bank UniCredit were down by about
40 percent over the period. This somewhat surprising decline followed the release of the
s
t
n
e terms of a previously announced rights offering and prompted concerns that other
m
p euro-area banks may be discouraged from seeking to raise further capital in the equity
o
l
e market.
v
e
D
l
a Emerging market equity and bond funds continued to experience outflows,
i
c
n
a although the pace of such flows slowed in January. Rating agencies cut Hungary’s
n
i
F sovereign debt rating to junk status, and Hungarian asset prices came under pressure.
Foreign private-investor demand for U.S. Treasury securities picked up notably in
November, consistent with the general decrease in risk appetite at that time. Official
inflows were also sizable, as foreign exchange intervention activity boosted official
purchases of Treasury securities. Partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York show a sharp decline in official holdings in
December. Although some of this decline seems to reflect actual sales, it also appears
that some official investors are shifting Treasury holdings to foreign custodians, and
those holdings are not captured in either the TIC or the FRBNY data.

DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Broad equity price indexes increased more than 4½ percent, on net, over the
intermeeting period, reflecting in part somewhat better-than-expected U.S. economic data
releases and some easing in concerns about Europe. Option-implied volatility on the
S&P 500 index declined to its lowest levels since July but remained well above its range
in the first half of 2011. The staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected real
equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the
equity premium—remained extraordinarily wide.
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms increased 8 percent in the third
quarter, reflecting in part transitory gains for financial firms. Over the intermeeting
period, bottom-up Wall Street forecasts for earnings in the fourth quarter fell a bit and
now point to a small decline from third-quarter levels. An index of revisions to analysts’
forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms, which registered notable negative
values starting last August, eased some for the four-week period ending in
mid-December.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds declined a bit more than those on
comparable-maturity Treasury securities. Yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds
and their spreads to yields on Treasury securities decreased noticeably. Conditions in the
s
t
secondary leveraged loan market were stable, with median bid prices about unchanged. n

Bond issuance by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations was strong, though below
its outsized November pace, while that by lower-rated firms slowed, likely owing in part
to seasonal factors. Nonfinancial CP outstanding contracted somewhat amid moderate
year-end pressures, and C&I loans posted solid growth. Issuance of leveraged loans was
relatively modest in the fourth quarter compared with its robust pace earlier in the year.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms continued to rebound in
December from a slow third-quarter pace, boosted by previously withdrawn IPOs that
were brought to market. Share repurchases and cash-financed mergers by nonfinancial

firms maintained their recent strength in the third quarter, leaving net equity issuance
deeply negative. Preliminary data on merger activity and announcements of new share
repurchase programs suggest that net equity issuance likely remained quite negative in
the fourth quarter.
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to be solid.
The aggregate ratio of debt to assets remained low in the third quarter, and the liquid
asset ratio was near its highest level in more than 20 years. The volume of corporate
bonds of nonfinancial companies upgraded by Moody’s Investor Service in the
fourth quarter continued to substantially outpace the volume of those downgraded.
American Airlines filed for bankruptcy in November, which pushed up a bit the
six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms; nonetheless, the rate remained
fairly low overall. The expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from the
Moody’s KMV model ticked down in December, reflecting lower stock price volatility
and higher asset valuations.
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained tight. Issuance of
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remained subdued in the fourth quarter,
a pace expected to persist in 2012. CMBS spreads over swaps declined over the
intermeeting period, in line with the decreases seen for other higher-risk fixed-income
securities. Responses to the January SLOOS indicate that bank CRE lending standards s
t

remain extraordinarily tight, but compared with one year ago, some banks reported e

having reduced the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for the first time since o

HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Conditions in mortgage markets remained extremely tight. Although mortgage
interest rates and yields on current-coupon agency MBS edged down further to near their
historical lows, mortgage refinancing activity stayed subdued, as tight underwriting and
low levels of home equity continued to limit the access of many households to the
mortgage market. Moreover, mortgage delinquency rates, while improving gradually,
remained elevated relative to pre-crisis norms.

House prices continued to move lower. The November reading of the CoreLogic
repeat-sales house price index was more than 4 percent below its year-ago level.
Although the decreases in home prices have been larger in recent months than during the
summer, some of the declines likely reflect a seasonal increase in the share of distressed
sales.
The price of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as
measured by the ABX index, rose over the intermeeting period, in line with the changes
for other higher-risk fixed-income securities. The market remains somewhat illiquid, as
demonstrated by a temporary drop in the ABX index after rumors surfaced about the
possible sale of the subprime RMBS in the Maiden Lane II portfolio. The new-issue
market for subprime RMBS remains closed, and non-agency issuance is limited to the
occasional securitization of small portfolios of high-quality jumbo mortgages.
On the whole, conditions in consumer credit markets showed signs of
improvement. Consumer credit increased robustly in November, while delinquency rates
on credit card loans in securitized pools held steady in November at the lowest levels
seen in the 20-year history of the series. Lending standards on consumer loans continued
to ease modestly, as evidenced both from Mintel data on credit card offers and from
responses to the January SLOOS. Issuance of consumer ABS in the fourth quarter held
s steady at the moderate levels observed throughout 2011.

strength in new capital issuances. CDS spreads for states inched down further over the
intermeeting period. Yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds fell
notably, leaving the yield ratio at about 1.3. However, downgrades of municipal bonds
continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the third quarter, and higher-frequency
data on ratings changes suggest that this pattern may have been even more pronounced in
the fourth quarter.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
In the fourth quarter, bank credit continued to increase, as banks accumulated
agency MBS and the growth of total loans picked up. Core loans—the sum of C&I loans,
real estate loans, and consumer loans—expanded modestly. Growth of C&I loans at
domestic banks was robust but was partly offset by weakness at European institutions.
Despite their steady growth in 2011, C&I loans have so far offset only about 30 percent
of the steep declines posted between late 2008 and mid-2010. Home equity loans fell
further in the fourth quarter, and commercial real estate loans contracted for the 12th
consecutive quarter, though the pace of contraction appeared to slow somewhat in
November and December. Noncore loans—a category that includes lending to nonbank
financial institutions—rose sharply, on net, in the fourth quarter, reflecting in part a surge
in such loans at U.S. branches and agencies of European banks.
s
t
Portfolio-weighted responses to the January SLOOS indicated that, in the n
e
m
aggregate, loan demand strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit further in p
o
the fourth quarter. In particular, notable fractions of domestic banks reported stronger e l
v
e
demand for C&I loans from firms of all sizes, and the net fraction of banks reporting D
l
increased demand from small firms rose to its highest level since 2005. Domestic banks a

c
n
reported unchanged standards on C&I loans over the fourth quarter, but significant net a
n
i
fractions continued to report reduced pricing on these loans on net. Branches and F
agencies of foreign banks reported having tightened both standards and terms on
C&I loans. Moderate fractions of both domestic and foreign banks again reported having
tightened standards on loans to nonfinancial firms with significant exposure to Europe.
(See the box “Dollar Funding Strains and Credit Provision of U.S. Branches and
Agencies of European Banks.”) Many domestic banks also reported an increase in
business as a result of a decrease in competition from European banks. Moreover,
SLOOS responses indicated that large fractions of domestic banks expected that over the
next 12 months, credit quality in most major loan categories would improve.

Dollar Funding Strains and Credit Provision of
U.S. Branches and Agencies of European Banks
The U.S. branches and agencies of European banks (hereafter, European branches) currently
account for about 10 percent of total commercial bank assets in the United States.1 Thus, pressures
on such firms caused by the ongoing fiscal and banking problems in Europe could have noticeable
effects on lending in the United States. Indeed, the composition of the balance sheets of European
branches has changed markedly since the strains in short‐term unsecured dollar funding markets
intensified in mid‐2011.
Since mid‐2011, European branches have changed the structure of their funding—their holdings of
large‐denomination time deposits have dropped steadily, and they have shifted from being a net
supplier of dollars to their related offices to being net receivers of such funds (see lower‐left
figure). Other funding sources have also become less available to European branches; for example,
respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS)
reported widespread tightening of standards on loans to European banks or their affiliates and
subsidiaries over the second half of the year (see appendix). Moreover, some European branches
have run down their cash assets significantly. These recent patterns have primarily reflected
developments at the U.S. branches of French banks, which reportedly have faced substantial
funding pressures since mid‐2011.2
The funding strains also appear to have resulted in some reduction in the provision of credit to U.S.
firms by most European branches.3 C&I loans held by these branches have declined noticeably
since the middle of last year even as the overall demand for such loans, as reported in the SLOOS,
s has reportedly increased (see lower‐right figure).

The U.S. branches of Spanish and Italian banks generally have been shrinking since early 2010, but these
institutions are quite small relative to the French and the non‐French European branches.

U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks generally do not provide credit to U.S. households.

In addition, a significant fraction of European branches reportedly tightened standards and terms
on C&I loans during the second half of last year, whereas domestic banks generally eased some of
their lending policies on such loans on net. Moreover, because a tightening of standards and terms
tends to be reflected with a lag in the stock of loans outstanding, the SLOOS results suggest that a
further contraction in the C&I loans of European branches may be likely.
In contrast, lending by European branches to nonbank financial institutions has surged over the
second half of the year. However, the increase is due entirely to reverse repurchase agreements by
a couple of French branches that have reportedly provided substantial funding to their affiliated
U.S. broker–dealers. Indeed, such loans at the non‐French European branches have declined over
the same period.
On the whole, it appears that the changes in credit flows to the U.S. economy from European
branches have not yet begun to restrain the provision of credit to U.S. firms; to the contrary, the
available data indicate that other institutions have stepped in to provide credit directly to U.S.
businesses. After expanding at an 8 percent average annual rate over the first half of last year,
total C&I loans grew 11 percent over the second half of the year, as a pickup in C&I lending by
domestic institutions and non‐European branches more than offset the declines at the European
branches. Indeed, many domestic respondents to the latest SLOOS reported an “increase in
business” over the past six months as a result of reduced competition from European banks.
Going forward, however, the European parent institutions have strong incentives to shrink their
s
balance sheets and other credit exposures. In addition to ongoing funding strains, they face t
n
e
enhanced capital and liquidity requirements and pressure from domestic supervisors to pull back m
from foreign markets.4 According to press reports and the edit explanations received with our p
o
weekly bank balance sheet data, some European banks have sold securities and other U.S. assets, e l
v
including loans, but the quantities do not appear to have been substantial, at least thus far. In e
D
addition, available data on off‐balance‐sheet exposures indicate that European branches had about
l
a
$110 billion of outstanding standby letters of credit to U.S. addressees and about $360 billion of c i
n
unused commitments to fund loans at the end of the third quarter, quantities that already stand a
n
well below their pre‐crisis levels. Furthermore, some European financial institutions have large F i
securities and trading operations in the United States; as marketmakers and providers of liquidity,
these institutions are instrumental to intermediation activities, and their withdrawal from these
activities could have important consequences for various forms of credit extension and financial
market liquidity.
4
European parent institutions reportedly face pressure regarding early implementation of
Basel III requirements, and the European Banking Authority (EBA) announced that 71 large European banks must
meet a temporary 9 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio requirement by the end of June 2012. By itself, the EBA’s
estimated capital shortfall for core European banks―about €31 billion―is deemed to be manageable.

M2 increased at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in December.4 The level of M2
remained elevated relative to the staff’s assessment of fundamentals, likely reflecting
investors’ desire to hold safe and liquid assets in the face of the European crisis. In
addition, demand deposits surged around year-end, reportedly as lenders in repo and
other short-term funding markets chose to leave substantial balances with banks over the
turn of the year. The monetary base—reserve balances and currency—increased in
December along with currency. Reserve balances were roughly unchanged over the
period; a decline in reserve balances resulting from an increase in balances in the
Treasury’s general account offset the boost to reserve levels associated with the increased
drawings of foreign central banks on the dollar liquidity swap lines. (See the box

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
Over the intermeeting period, total assets of the Federal Reserve increased
$19 billion to $2,924 billion (see the table on the facing page).
Since the December FOMC meeting, the Open Market Desk conducted
19 operations as part of the maturity extension program: the Desk purchased
$40 billion in Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years and
sold $62 billion in Treasury securities with maturities of 3 years or less.1 In
addition, the Desk purchased $33 billion in agency MBS securities as part of the
policy of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS.
Because of agency MBS market conventions, settlements of these transactions
can occur well after trade execution.
Foreign central bank liquidity swaps increased $49 billion to $103 billion, primarily
reflecting large 84‐day draws by the European Central Bank and the Bank of
Japan. The net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC declined $3 billion largely
reflecting ongoing asset sales, while holdings of the Maiden Lane II and Maiden
Lane III LLCs were nearly unchanged. Loans outstanding under the Term Asset‐
Backed Securities Loan Facility declined about $1 billion to $9 billion.
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the Treasury’s
s
n t General Account increased $33 billion, and Federal Reserve notes in circulation
e
m increased $4 billion. Reserve balances of depository institutions increased
p $8 billion over the period while other deposits decreased $17 billion, reflecting a
o
l
e decline of relatively high GSE balances that had been accumulated prior to the
v
e payment of principal and interest on agency MBS last month. Term deposits held
D
l by depository institutions declined by $2 billion as a $5 billion small‐value
a
c i operation of the Term Deposit Facility matured on December 15, 2011, and a
n
a smaller $3 billion operation was conducted on January 9, 2012. The auction size
n
F i for these small‐value operations was reduced in light of relatively low bid‐to‐
cover ratios in the prior few auctions. Reverse repurchase transactions with
foreign official and international accounts decreased $1 billion.
1
Purchases of $5 billion conducted on January 13, 2012, and $3 billion conducted on
January 17, 2012, are not reflected in the table, as settlement occurred after January 13, 2012. A
purchase of $1 billion conducted before the December FOMC meeting settled on December 13,
2011, and is reflected in the table but not in the text above.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
Overall, in the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,
modest net fractions of domestic banks reportedly eased their lending standards and experienced
stronger demand over the past three months.1 However, econometric analysis shows that the
amount of easing reported in the January survey was more than would have been expected once a
number of bank-specific factors and the evolution of several key macroeconomic variables over
the survey period are taken into account. Meanwhile, foreign respondents, which mainly lend to
businesses, reported a net tightening of their lending standards.2
Regarding business loans, domestic banks reported, on balance, little change in standards
on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans but a continued easing of pricing terms on those loans
during the fourth quarter. Consistent with strong growth in C&I loans in recent months, domestic
banks reportedly experienced stronger demand for C&I loans from firms of all sizes on net. The
net fraction of banks reporting increased demand from small firms rose to its highest level since
2005.3 Many domestic banks also reported an increase in business as a result of reduced
competition from European banks (or their branches and subsidiaries). Indeed, foreign
respondents reported having tightened both standards and terms on C&I loans, on net, and they
noted that loan demand had been about unchanged over the past three months. Domestic banks
continued to report little change in their standards for commercial real estate (CRE) loans, but
modest net fractions had eased some loan terms over the past year. As has been the case recently,
s
t
moderate net fractions of domestic banks reported that demand for CRE loans had strengthened. n

1 The January 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to
businesses and households over the past three months. This appendix is based on responses from
56 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Respondent banks received the
survey on or after December 21, 2011, and responses were due by January 10, 2012.
2 For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction
of banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased
standards. For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.

On the household side, lending standards and demand for loans to purchase residential
real estate were reportedly little changed over the fourth quarter on net. Standards on home
equity lines of credit (HELOCs) were about unchanged, while demand for such loans continued
to weaken on net. On a loan-weighted basis, however, standards on both purchase loans and
HELOCs have eased modestly in each of the past several surveys.4 Moderate net fractions of
banks reported that they had eased standards on all types of consumer loans over the past three
months, and some banks also eased terms on auto loans. Demand for credit card and auto loans
reportedly increased somewhat, while demand for other types of consumer loans was about
unchanged.
In response to a set of special questions regarding respondents’ outlook for asset quality
in 2012, moderate net fractions of domestic banks reportedly expect that ongoing improvements
in credit quality will continue this year in most major loan categories.
LENDING TO BUSINESSES
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending
Domestic banks reported that their credit standards on C&I loans to firms of all sizes
were little changed over the fourth quarter on net. However, U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks reportedly tightened their standards on C&I loans for the second consecutive
quarter, on balance. The tightening by foreign survey respondents was again primarily limited to
U.S. branches and agencies of European banks.
A large net fraction of domestic banks eased many terms on C&I loans to firms of all
s
sizes. Spreads and costs of credit lines for large firms were trimmed by a somewhat larger t
n
e
fraction of banks than in the previous survey. A moderate net fraction of banks also indicated a m
p
reduction in their use of interest rate floors. In addition, several large banks eased loan covenants o

to large and middle-market firms, a change that is consistent with reports of more-accommodative e
v

lending conditions in the syndicated loan market in recent months. D

only about a quarter of those banks attributing the change to an improved or less uncertain
economic outlook. The handful of banks that reported having tightened at least one C&I loan
term primarily cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and increased concerns
about legislative, supervisory, or accounting policies.
Meanwhile, foreign survey respondents continued to tighten terms on C&I loans, on net,
primarily reflecting actions taken by those with European parents. Almost half of the European
respondents and only a quarter of the non-European foreign respondents reduced the maximum
size of credit lines. European respondents were also more likely than other branches and agencies

in the survey to have reduced the maximum maturity of C&I loans and to have increased the cost
of such credit lines. Foreign respondents that reported having tightened their standards or terms
on C&I loans unanimously cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook. Notably,
about one-third of the European respondents that had tightened at least one term over the past
three months cited concerns about their capital position while none of the non-European foreign
respondents that had tightened cited this reason. Liquidity concerns were cited as a reason for
tightening standards or terms on C&I loans by about one-third of both the European and
non-European foreign respondents.
Reports from domestic banks of stronger demand for C&I loans outnumbered reports of
weaker demand, in contrast to the net weakening of demand reported in the previous survey.
Moreover, about 15 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported increased demand from small
firms, the largest net percentage that has been reported since 2005. Similarly, domestic banks
reported a net increase in the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers regarding
new or increased credit lines. Domestic banks that saw weaker demand and those that saw
stronger demand both cited changes in customers’ funding needs related to inventories, accounts
receivable, and mergers and acquisitions as important factors underlying the change in demand.
Of domestic banks reporting weaker demand, about 85 percent cited reduced funding needs for
capital investment. Foreign respondents experienced little change, on net, in demand for C&I
loans.
Special Questions on Lending to Firms with European Exposures
A set of special questions in the January survey asked respondents about lending to banks
headquartered in Europe and their affiliates and subsidiaries (regardless of the location of the
s
affiliates and subsidiaries) as well as to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United n t
e
States and significant exposures to European economies (regardless of the location of the firms). m

firms that have operations in the United States and significant exposure to European economies.
No domestic or foreign respondent reported that it had eased standards to either type of firm.
Demand for credit was reportedly little changed, on net, from European banks (or their affiliates
and subsidiaries) and from nonfinancial firms with significant European exposure.
A new special question asked if domestic respondents had experienced an increase in
business over the past six months as a result of decreased competition from European banks
(or their affiliates and subsidiaries). About half of the respondents who reported competing with
European banks for business noted such an increase in business. One large domestic bank
specifically reported that business increased slightly in the syndicated loan market because some
European banks have withdrawn from such lending activity to conserve capital.

Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending
Domestic banks continued to report little change in their standards on CRE loans, which
were widely described in a special question in the July survey (two quarters ago) as being at or
near their tightest levels since 2005. A moderate net fraction of foreign survey respondents
reportedly tightened their standards on such loans.
As has been the case recently, moderate fractions of domestic banks reported that demand
for CRE loans had strengthened, on net, over the past three months. In contrast, the foreign
respondents reported that demand for CRE loans had remained little changed over that period.
Overall, this net strengthening in demand is roughly consistent with an apparent slowing in the
pace of runoff of CRE loans at banks during November and December, although most other
indicators of activity in markets to finance CRE remain depressed.
Annual Question on Commercial Real Estate Loan Terms
The January survey also included a question regarding changes in terms on CRE loans
over the past year (repeated annually since 2001). During the past 12 months, on net, some
domestic banks reportedly eased maximum CRE loan sizes and many domestic banks eased loan
spreads. Furthermore, a few large domestic banks, on balance, reported that they had lengthened
maximum loan maturities. Other terms for CRE loans were reportedly little changed. Overall,
the results for this special question show the first time since January 2007 that domestic banks
had eased any of the CRE loan terms covered in the survey.
Foreign respondents reported having tightened some terms and eased others on CRE
loans. On net, about 15 percent of foreign respondents reported that they had tightened debt
s
t
service coverage ratios, but about 15 percent reported that they had increased maximum loan n
e
m
sizes. Other terms for CRE loans were reportedly little changed on balance.

However, when the responses are weighted by outstanding closed-end mortgages held on banks’

standards. Weighted responses, which may better account for overall activity in mortgage
lending given that it is highly concentrated among the largest banks, have shown weaker demand
and an easing of standards in recent quarters. Nonetheless, standards likely remain tighter than
their average level since 2005, as reported in a special question in the July survey.
Most banks continued to report little change in their lending standards for HELOCs,
a pattern seen since the beginning of 2011. When responses are weighted by the amount of
outstanding home equity loans, however, about 20 percent of banks, on net, reported having eased

continued to weaken, on net, regardless of whether the responses are weighted.
Questions on Consumer Lending
As in the previous three surveys, small fractions of domestic banks reported having eased
standards on credit card, auto, and other consumer loans. In addition, modest net fractions of
banks continued to report having narrowed spreads and lengthened maximum maturities on auto
loans. However, other terms across the categories of consumer loans were little changed on net.
A few banks, on balance, reported stronger demand for auto loans, with such reports
coming primarily from large banks.5 A few small banks reported stronger demand for credit card
loans. Demand for other consumer loans was reportedly about unchanged.
ANNUAL QUESTIONS ON ASSET QUALITY EXPECTATIONS
The survey contained a set of special questions on respondents’ expectations for loan
quality in 2012. Overall, between 15 and 60 percent of domestic banks, on net, expected
improvements in delinquency and charge-off rates during 2012 in the major loan categories
included in the survey, assuming that economic activity progresses in line with consensus
forecasts. These questions have been asked once each year for the past five years. Expectations
for improvement in 2012 were reportedly less widespread than when asked a year ago, but last
year’s expectations were the broadest in the history of the question. Furthermore, loan quality did
improve noticeably over the past year.
s
Banks were least likely to forecast improvement in the quality of consumer loans in 2012. t
n
e
Only about 20 percent of banks, on net, expected improvement in credit card loans, and a similar m
fraction projected improvement in other consumer loans. However, the current credit quality of p

these types of loans appears to be high. According to Call Report data available through the third e

Significantly more survey respondents reportedly expect the asset quality of
nontraditional residential real estate loans to improve in 2012 than did last year. Indeed, about
55 percent of banks, on net, anticipate that delinquency and charge-off rates on such
nontraditional loans will decline this year compared with about 20 percent of the respondents to
last year’s survey. Expectations for improvements this year in the asset quality of prime
residential real estate loans and for HELOCs stayed roughly the same as last year, with a bit more
than one-third of the respondents anticipating an improvement in the quality of such loans.

Regarding the outlook for the quality of business loans, about 50 percent of domestic
banks, on net, reportedly expect delinquency and charge-off rates to decline in 2012 on their
C&I loans both to large and middle-market firms and to small firms. Smaller domestic
respondents were more likely to expect improvements in C&I loan quality this year than their
larger counterparts. About 60 percent of domestic banks indicated that they expect improvement
in the quality of CRE loans this year. In contrast, foreign respondents, on net, reportedly
anticipate no improvement in the quality of C&I loans this year, and only about 25 percent of
these respondents forecast improvement in the quality of CRE loans.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic activity as
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by
the FOMC).1 The considerable risks surrounding the European sovereign debt crisis
contribute importantly to this assessment. In addition, we still see the aftereffects of the
financial crisis and subsequent recession as implying unusual uncertainty regarding the
level of economic slack and the likely pace of the recovery going forward. Moreover,
uncertainty about the capacity of either fiscal or monetary policy to counteract any
further weakening in economic activity is high, and in the case of fiscal policy, is
magnified by the unsustainability of current policies over the longer run. These factors,
most especially risks from Europe, also lead us to continue to see the risks to real activity
as skewed to the downside.
With regard to inflation, we see the risks surrounding our baseline forecast as
balanced. On the one hand, low levels of resource utilization, small increases in unit
labor costs, and the disproportionate possibility that economic conditions could be less
favorable than in baseline could cause inflation to drift down over time. On the other
hand, concerns related to the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to
execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy could cause inflation to move up,
as might renewed increases in commodity prices or a sharper depreciation of the
exchange value of the dollar. With regard to the overall degree of uncertainty, we take
some reassurance from the relative stability of inflation expectations. In addition, the
behavior of inflation over the past several years has accorded reasonably well with our
assessment of how stable inflation expectations, shifts in the prices of imports and
energy, and economic slack influence the evolution of consumer prices. As a result,
while we see considerable risks around our inflation projection, we do not view these
risks as unusually high.
y
t
n
1 This assessment of heightened uncertainty holds despite marked increases over the past few a i
t
years in the benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity. In particular, as the fixed e r
c
20-year window used to assess the typical size of forecast errors has rolled forward to include the n
U
pronounced volatility of the past few years, the estimated standard error for out-year projections of the
&
unemployment rate has almost doubled. Thus, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity
s
are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great Moderation period. (In contrast, benchmark k
s
estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged.) R i

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we constructed several alternatives
to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first scenario, we
assume that we have underestimated the extent of the balance sheet repair and
improvement in credit availability that has occurred to date, implying a faster recovery of
aggregate spending and production than in the baseline. In contrast, the second scenario
examines a downside risk to activity—namely, that household and financial institution
deleveraging and weak confidence will restrain the pace of economic recovery markedly
for many years, resulting in a “lost decade.” The next two scenarios turn to opposing
risks to the outlook for inflation. The first inflation scenario assumes that the margin of
slack is currently narrower than assumed in the baseline and than policymakers estimate,
resulting in more upward pressure on both actual and expected inflation. Conversely, the
second inflation scenario considers the possibility that inflation will decline by more than
we anticipate because the persistently elevated level of slack in labor and product markets
leads to self-reinforcing downward pressure on inflation expectations, along the lines of
the predictions of accelerationist Phillips curves. Finally, we examine two risks to the
outlook coming from abroad—a severe financial crisis in Europe that spills over to the
United States and the rest of the world, and a sharp rise in oil prices driven by supply
disruptions.
We generated the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated
policy rule for the federal funds rate that responds to core PCE inflation and a measure of
economic slack based on the staff’s estimate of potential output. In contrast, the last two
scenarios were generated using the multicountry SIGMA model and a different policy
rule that employs an alternative concept of resource utilization.2 In all of the scenarios,
the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow their baseline
paths.

bond issuance and C&I lending have been solid. Moreover, the apparent improvement in
recent labor market and production indicators may signal that a sustained economic
recovery is getting under way, and a greater release of pent-up demand for durable goods
represents an upside risk to our outlook; for example, the average age of motor vehicles
on the road is still rising and the level of the E&S capital stock is well below its trend. In
this scenario, easier credit conditions, more-rapidly falling risk premiums, and pent-up
demand lead to a stronger pace of consumption and investment outlays. Real GDP rises a
bit more than 3 percent, on average, in 2012 and 2013, bringing the unemployment rate
down to 7¼ percent by the end of 2013, almost 1 percentage point below baseline.
Initially, the stronger pace of recovery has little effect on inflation, in part because greater
capital investment increases labor productivity, thereby holding down unit labor costs;
anchored long-run inflation expectations also contribute to the muted response of
inflation. Over time, however, tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to move
above baseline. Largely in response to the stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds
rate begins to rise at the end of next year.
Lost Decade
Our baseline forecast depends importantly on steady improvements in credit
availability, consumer and business confidence, the balance sheet positions of households
and financial institutions, and the willingness of firms to hire. In this scenario, these
improvements are slower to materialize than in the baseline and cause the pace of the
recovery to remain sluggish. Moreover, the persistently slow growth in spending and
output has a corrosive effect on the supply side of the economy because, with
unemployment remaining very high for many years, the skills and labor force attachment
of unemployed workers erode more than in the baseline. In particular, the downward
trend in labor force participation steepens relative to baseline while the NAIRU edges up
to 6¼ percent by 2014 and thereafter declines only slowly, leaving it, on average,
¼ percentage point above its baseline path over the simulation period. In all, potential
GDP expands about ½ percentage point less per year through 2016. Under these
conditions, real GDP expands at only a 2 percent annual rate, on average, through the
y
middle of the decade. With the expansion in aggregate demand only matching that of t
n
i
a
potential output, the unemployment rate remains near recent levels through 2016. As a t
r
e
consequence, inflation eventually falls below 1¼ percent despite the damage inflicted on c

federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound beyond 2016. k s

Greater Supply-Side Damage
Although the staff estimates that potential GDP growth has been relatively weak
since the financial crisis, the supply side of the economy may already have suffered more
damage than we judge. In this scenario, the current output gap is assumed to be only
about half as large as in the baseline, reflecting smaller structural productivity gains over
the past few years, a larger decline in trend labor force participation, and a higher
NAIRU. Less slack and lower productivity in turn imply higher unit labor costs and
greater upward pressure on prices than in the baseline. Moreover, these inflationary
forces are amplified by the assumption that policymakers only gradually recognize the
less-favorable supply-side conditions, which leads the public to expect somewhat higher
inflation over the long run. Under these assumptions, real GDP expands about
¾ percentage point less rapidly per year, on average, through 2016 than in the baseline,
partly because households and businesses recognize the weaker trajectory for trend
income and earnings. Meanwhile, core PCE inflation gradually moves up to around
2½ percent. In response to higher inflation, the federal funds rate begins to rise about a
year earlier than in the baseline.
Disinflation
The stability of various measures of expected inflation to date may be misleading
us about the potential for further disinflation, particularly in the context of a baseline
outlook in which the economy is persistently weak. In this scenario, both expected and
actual inflation drift down steadily over time, with inflation reaching zero by 2015; such
a decline in inflation would be in line with the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips
curves. As disinflationary pressures mount, investors become increasingly concerned
about the economy becoming mired in persistent deflation; as a result, bond premiums
rise, thereby modestly damping spending and boosting unemployment relative to
baseline. In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate
remains at its effective lower bound through 2016.
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers

a
t In this scenario, Europe’s fiscal and financial difficulties intensify in coming

result from a disorderly sovereign default, a failure of a large European financial
&
s institution, or because the public loses confidence in the ability of European governments

to resolve the crisis. Specifically, European sovereign and private borrowing costs soar,
as corporate bond spreads rise 400 basis points above baseline, and household and
business confidence plummets. European real GDP declines almost 10 percent relative to
baseline by the end of 2013, notwithstanding a 20 percent real effective depreciation of
the euro. Given substantial cross-border financial and macroeconomic linkages, as well
as the still-fragile state of the U.S. economy, Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have
important spillovers to the United States and throughout the world. U.S. domestic
demand contracts sharply in response to higher borrowing costs (corporate bond spreads
widen by more than 300 basis points relative to the baseline), a much weaker stock
market, reduced access to credit, and decreases in household and business confidence.
In addition, weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar depress U.S. net exports.
All told, U.S. real GDP contracts 3 percent this year and the unemployment rate rises to
over 11½ percent by late 2013, nearly 3½ percentage points above baseline. With
substantially greater resource slack and lower import prices, overall consumer prices in
the United States decline in 2012 and 2013.3 Under these conditions, the federal funds
rate remains near zero until late 2016.
Higher Oil Prices
Although we project that oil prices will change little over the forecast period,
there is a high degree of uncertainty around this projection. The recent tensions with Iran
over its nuclear program, with Iranian authorities threatening to block the Strait of
Hormuz and disrupt global oil supplies, is just one example of the risks threatening the
outlook for oil prices. This scenario assumes that geopolitical disturbances drive oil
prices $50 per barrel above baseline in the first half of this year before these prices
gradually recede. Although a supply-driven increase in oil prices might normally be
expected to cause the dollar to depreciate, we assume here instead that the heightened
geopolitical tensions increase the demand for dollar-denominated assets and cause the
dollar to appreciate slightly. U.S. domestic demand falls relative to baseline because
higher oil prices reduce permanent income and lower the return on investment, and real
y
t
3 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking n
i
a
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA. Thus, long-run inflation expectations remain firmly anchored t
r
e
at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and productivity is c
n
weaker (reflecting reduced capital spending). In addition, import price inflation runs significantly higher U
than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial appreciation is gradually reversed. Under alternative &
specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, would allow for more structural persistence in the inflation s
k
process or a less firm anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period. s

exports also decline relative to baseline due to weaker foreign activity. All told, U.S. real
GDP rises only 1½ percent, on average, this year and next, and the unemployment rate
hovers just below 9 percent in 2013. Reflecting the jump in energy costs, overall PCE
inflation jumps to nearly 3½ percent this year but then moderates substantially as oil
prices begin their slow decline. Core PCE inflation increases to about 1¾ percent in
2012 and 2013 as firms pass on higher production costs to households. Although the
liftoff of the federal funds rate is unchanged from baseline, the removal of monetary
accommodation thereafter proceeds a bit more gradually.
OUTSIDE FORECASTS
In the January 10 release (based on responses gathered on January 4 and 5, before
the release of the most recent labor market report), the Blue Chip consensus projection
showed real GDP rising 2.3 percent over the four quarters of 2012, ¼ percentage point
above the staff forecast; for 2013, the Blue Chip outlook of 2.8 percent is almost
½ percentage point above that of the staff. The Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment
rate at the end of 2013 was 8.0 percent, somewhat below the staff projection of
8.2 percent. Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip panelists anticipated that the overall CPI
will increase 2 percent in 2012 and 2.2 percent in 2013, ½ percentage point higher than
the staff projection next year and 1 percentage point higher in 2013.
