Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information that we have received since the July Tealbook suggests a D
n
somewhat weaker pace of economic recovery than we had previously projected. The two o
c
E
latest monthly employment reports showed somewhat less improvement in the labor
c
i
t
market than we had expected. In response, we have nudged down our forecast of job s
e
m
gains—and nudged up our forecast of the unemployment rate—through the end of the o
D
year. And overall consumer spending has been disappointing, despite strong motor
vehicle sales.1 On the brighter side, industrial production has continued to advance, and
forward-looking indicators from the manufacturing surveys have been quite strong. All
told, we now expect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of a little less than 3 percent in
the second half of this year, ½ percentage point below the July Tealbook.
Our medium-term projection for economic activity is also a little weaker than in
the July Tealbook, mainly reflecting a higher projected path for the exchange value of the
dollar as well as a modestly lower projected path for house prices. Even so, we still
expect output growth to pick up over the next two years as factors that have been
restraining the economic recovery continue to ease and confidence in the underpinnings
of the economic situation improves further. Our current forecast anticipates that real
GDP will increase 2.7 percent next year and 2.9 percent in 2016, ¼ percentage point
lower, on average, than our forecast in the July Tealbook. With monetary policy
accommodation being withdrawn, GDP growth is anticipated to slow to 2¼ percent
in 2017.
The projected path of the unemployment rate is higher in this projection, and
entails less undershooting of the natural rate, than in the July Tealbook. Nevertheless, the
unemployment rate still is projected to edge down gradually over the next several years
and bottoms out at just a little below 5 percent in 2017, roughly ¼ percentage point below
our estimate of the natural rate.
1 This assessment may need to be revised. On Thursday, September 11, after Book A of the
Tealbook closes, we are scheduled to receive second-quarter data from the Quarterly Services Survey.
On Friday, September 12, we are scheduled to receive the retail sales report for August along with revised
estimates for June and July.

& Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
l
e
v
e
D The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following
n the June 2014 FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current
o
c
E economic projection to the one we presented in the June Tealbook. Relative to
c the June Tealbook, we have marked down somewhat our projection for real GDP
i
t
e s growth in the second half of this year and over the next three years. The
m
unemployment rate is expected to be slightly lower at the end of this year than it
o
D
was in the June Tealbook, but our projection over the subsequent three years is a
bit higher than it was in our June forecast. By the end of the medium-term
projection, the output gap comes into line with the signal from the
unemployment rate gap.
The staff’s projections for both overall and core PCE inflation are little changed,
on balance, from those in the June forecast. We continue to project that both
core and headline inflation will remain below the Committee’s 2 percent
objective through 2017. With our forecasts for inflation and resource utilization
similar to what they were in the June Tealbook, and our assumption that the
federal funds rate will lift off in the second quarter of 2015 unchanged, the
projected path for the federal funds rate is about the same as it was in our
June forecast.

The recent price data have come in softer than we expected. We continue to think u t
O
that core inflation will slow from the second-quarter pace of 2 percent, and we now
&
project core PCE price inflation of 1½ percent in both the third and fourth quarters. Over e l
v
e
the medium term, we still expect core inflation to step up gradually as resource slack D
n
diminishes, reaching 1.8 percent in 2017; the path is a bit lower than in July, mainly o
c
E
reflecting the weaker outlook for real activity. Over the medium term, consumer energy
c
i
t
prices are expected to be fairly flat, causing headline inflation to run a little below s
e
m
core inflation. o

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are unchanged from the
previous projection. We assume that asset purchases will conclude by the end
of October, leaving the cumulative amount of purchases under the current
program at close to $1.5 trillion.
 We continue to assume the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective
lower bound in the second quarter of 2015. We construe the two-quarter lag
from the assumed end in asset purchases to the liftoff of the federal funds rate
to be consistent with the “considerable time” language in the Committee’s
recent statements.
 Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises at a pace determined by the
prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule. The rule
puts the federal funds rate at about 2.3 percent at the end of 2016 (60 basis
points lower than in the July Tealbook) and at 3.2 percent at the end of 2017
(70 basis points lower than in the July Tealbook). Both figures are little
changed relative to the June Tealbook.
Other Interest Rates
 The anticipated trajectory for the 10-year Treasury yield averages about
15 basis points lower over the medium term than in the July Tealbook,
reflecting the downward adjustment to the projected path of the federal funds
rate. Our projection continues to call for a significant rise in Treasury yields,
primarily because of the movement of the 10-year valuation window through

 The current level of equity prices is in line with our July Tealbook projection.
Our forecast has stock prices rising at an average annual growth rate of 5½
percent in the projection period.
 Compared with the July Tealbook projection, the incoming house price data
have been weaker than expected, on balance, and we have extrapolated
forward some of that weakness. As a result, house prices, which are currently
slightly above their historical relationship with rents, return to our rough
benchmark of fair valuation a bit more quickly in this projection than in the
July Tealbook. We expect house price appreciation to continue to slow—
from 12 percent in 2013 to 5 percent this year and about 3 percent per year
from 2015 to 2017.
Fiscal Policy
 Our assumptions for fiscal policy are essentially unchanged from the July
Tealbook. The box “Fiscal Policy Restraint and Government Budget
Conditions” reviews the profile of fiscal impetus over the projection period.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 We estimate that real GDP in the foreign economies rose at an annual rate of
nearly 3 percent in the third quarter, up from a 2¼ percent pace in the first
half. We expect foreign growth to pick up a bit further to around 3¼ percent
over the rest of the forecast period. This forecast is little changed from that in
the previous Tealbook.
 The broad nominal index for the dollar has appreciated about 1¾ percent since
the previous Tealbook, with the dollar rising 4 to 5 percent against the euro,
yen, and pound. Going forward, we expect the broad real dollar to depreciate
at a 1 percent pace, with all the depreciation coming against the currencies of

O Fiscal Policy Restraint and Government Budget Conditions
&
l Over the past several years, fiscal policymakers at all levels of government have enacted
e
v
e spending reductions and tax increases as a reaction to the deterioration in budget
D
conditions after the most recent recession. In response, discretionary fiscal policy actions,
n
o on balance, have been a drag on economic growth in recent years. Government budget
c
E conditions have improved, however, and pressures for additional fiscal restraint are
c
t i expected to diminish substantially this year and over the medium term.
s
e
m
o The left-hand panel at the bottom of this page shows the staff’s measure of fiscal impetus
D
(FI), which is our estimate of the contribution to real GDP growth from discretionary
changes in fiscal policy (excluding multiplier effects). We estimate that the drag on real GDP
growth from fiscal policy actions at all levels of government was 1 percentage point in 2013,
but that it is narrowing to only ¼ percentage point in 2014 (the black line). As shown by the
blue portion of the bars, decreases in real federal purchases were an important factor in the
restraint estimated for last year, but they are making a much smaller negative contribution
this year. Since 2011, federal purchases have contracted because of the Budget Control Act’s
discretionary spending caps and the reductions in overseas military operations. But federal
purchases declined more precipitously in 2013, reflecting the onset of the federal spending
sequestration as well the government shutdown that temporarily held down purchases in
the fourth quarter of that year. The contribution to fiscal restraint from changes in taxes
and transfers (the green portion of the bars) was sizable last year, reflecting the expiration
of the temporary payroll tax cut as well as the implementation of tax increases on high-
income households. However, these tax changes are estimated to exert a smaller drag on
consumption spending growth this year than last, and the restraint from the ending of the
Emergency Unemployment Compensation program at the beginning of this year will be
about offset, in our estimation, by the boost to consumption that we expect will be induced
by the expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Finally, modest increases in state and local purchases (the purple portion of the bars)
provided a small boost to real GDP growth last year and are expected to do so this year as
well, largely manifesting as gains in state and local employment. As shown in the lower-right
panel, state and local government payrolls have been expanding over the past six quarters.

u
Fiscal restraint and the effects of the continuing economic recovery have led to improved O
budget conditions for federal, state, and local governments. For example, as shown by the &
l
black line in the left-hand panel at the bottom of this page, the federal budget deficit e
v
e
declined from 10 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4 percent last year. Changes in federal fiscal D
policies have reduced the structural deficit (the red portion of the bars), which excludes the n
o
effects of endogenous movements in tax revenues and spending that result from the c
E
business cycle (the yellow portion of the bars). We expect the deficit to remain around c
i
t
2½ percent of GDP over the medium term, a level consistent with temporarily stabilizing the s
e
ratio of federal debt to GDP above 70 percent, given our projection for GDP. Over the m
o
medium term and beyond, the normalization of interest rates will push up federal debt- D
servicing costs as a share of GDP. In addition, the aging of the population and ongoing
increases in health-care costs are expected to put more sizable upward pressure on the
structural deficit over the longer term.
Similar factors will also restrain state and local budgets over the medium and longer terms,
including pressures from their underfunded employee pension sytems and from rising costs
for Medicaid and health-care programs for state and local government retirees. State and
local tax receipts, shown in the lower-right panel, have posted moderate gains since the
second half of 2010 and are projected to continue increasing at a similar pace over the
medium term. Initially, these revenue increases were used to improve budget positions and
shore up depleted rainy day funds, but since last year these greater revenues have
supported modest increases in hiring. Over the medium term, we expect this pace of
revenue growth to allow state and local governments to slowly restore their employment to
its previous peak, even though long-term rising costs for health and retirement programs
will weigh heavily on these governments’ budgets for the foreseeable future.
All told, recent improvements in government budget conditions have reduced the need for
further fiscal restraint over the medium term. However, the current high level of federal
debt, along with the longer-term budget pressures facing all governments, allow little room
for expansionary fiscal policy actions. Indeed, further budget restraint will likely be needed
to reduce federal debt and provide fiscal policymakers with the capacity to respond to
unforeseen events.

u t the emerging market economies, while the dollar appreciates against the
O
currencies of the advanced economies. The projected pace of dollar
&
e l depreciation is little changed from the previous Tealbook, thereby maintaining
v
e
D the higher level of the dollar throughout the projection period.
n
o
c
E Oil and Other Commodity Prices
c
i
t
s  The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $8 per barrel since the time
e
m
of the previous Tealbook, although continued concerns about the longer-term
o
D
outlook for global oil production amid geopolitical turmoil have led farther-
dated futures prices to fall by less. Consequently, we project that the price of
imported oil will decline less steeply than in the previous forecast, falling
from about $92 per barrel at the end of this year to $89 per barrel at the end of
2017—a forecast about $7 per barrel and $2 per barrel less, respectively, than
in the July Tealbook.
 Nonfuel commodity prices are down slightly from the July Tealbook. Among
the categories with the largest price declines are iron ore, owing to continued
expansions of Australian shipments, and corn and soybeans, reflecting
favorable weather conditions. Over the forecast period, we project nonfuel
commodity prices to increase only slightly.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The most recent information indicates that aggregate output in the first half of this
year was not quite as anemic as earlier estimates had suggested. However, the bulk of the
upward revision was concentrated in inventory investment, and we unwound some of the
inventory surprise in the second half. Moreover, we pushed down our near-term
projection significantly in reaction to the surprising softness in consumer spending in
July. We now anticipate that real GDP growth will average an annual rate of a little less
than 3 percent in the second half of the year, about ½ percentage point less than in the
previous forecast.
 Overall consumer spending this quarter appears to be on a considerably
weaker trajectory than we had expected despite very strong motor vehicle
sales in August. Indeed, we are now forecasting that real PCE will increase at
an annual rate of only 2 percent in the third quarter, 1½ percentage points
below our forecast in the July Tealbook. Some of the downward revision can

o
l
be traced to the effects of unusually cool summer weather on energy demand, u t
O
a pattern that will reverse as temperatures normalize. Even after accounting
&
for these weather-related swings, however, the data in hand suggest that the e l
v
e
pace of spending has remained lackluster. In light of these data—which D
n
extend a string of negative PCE surprises—we trimmed our forecast for o
c
E
spending growth in the next several quarters.
c
i
t
s
e
 Incoming data about housing activity have been encouraging. Existing home m
o
D
sales have moved up at a brisk pace in recent months, and starts and permits
have improved from the low levels recorded early in the year. We continue to
forecast a modest acceleration in activity over the remainder of this year, as
ongoing job gains and diminishing concerns about the economic outlook
support the recovery in household formation, boosting the demand for new
homes and hence construction activity.
 Investment in equipment and intangibles increased at a moderate pace of
about 5 percent in the first half of the year and is projected to remain close to
that rate in the second half. Business investment in nonresidential structures
(outside of the drilling sector) rose only modestly, on average, in the first half
of the year, and our forecast for the second half calls for more of the same.
 Even with a strong rebound in the second quarter, real exports only edged
higher, on net, over the first half of this year. In the second half, exports are
expected to rise at a moderate annual rate of 4 percent, depressed a bit by the
drag from past dollar appreciation. Real imports are expected to rise at a
moderate pace of 2¼ percent in the second half, in part held back by a
continued decline in imports of oil. Altogether, the external sector is expected
to contribute ¼ percentage point to real GDP growth in the second half of this
year after having subtracted a full percentage point in the first half.
 Smoothing through wide swings in motor vehicle production, manufacturing
output appears to have increased moderately, on net, in July and August.
Looking ahead, we project manufacturing production to expand at a moderate
annual rate of about 3½ percent in the second half of the year, broadly similar
to our forecast in the July Tealbook. That said, national and regional
manufacturing surveys have been quite strong and may point to some upside
risk in this forecast.

n In particular, the tensions we perceive between product and labor market developments in
o
c
E the first half of this year remain unresolved. We therefore have held to the strategy, laid
c
t i out in the July Tealbook, of reacting to these tensions by adjusting potential GDP growth
s
e
m in 2014 so as to keep the output gap from becoming grossly misaligned with our
o
D assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market. We expect potential GDP to rise
1¾ percent next year and to accelerate gradually thereafter, the same as in the July
Tealbook.2
The revised NIPA figures and incoming data did lead us to make some
adjustments to our estimates of potential output:
 On net, the level of real GDP in the final quarter of 2013 was reported to be
¼ percent lower than in the previous vintage of NIPA data, and—consistent
with our practice in response to previous NIPA revisions—we made small
downward adjustments to our estimates of potential growth over the past
several years such that the output gap at the end of 2013 was unrevised
relative to the July Tealbook.
 In light of the two employment reports released since the July Tealbook, we
see current and prospective labor market conditions as a little weaker than we
previously believed and the unemployment rate gap as a little wider than
expected. In order to preserve the relative positioning of the output and
unemployment gaps, and with GDP growth revised up in the first half of the
year, we marked up our assumption for the growth of potential GDP this year
by ½ percentage point. This revision unwinds part of the downward
adjustments to potential GDP that we made in July.
2 We made no adjustments to the natural rate of unemployment this forecast round; thus, we
continue to assume that the natural rate completed the decline to its long-run level of 5.2 percent in the
second quarter of this year.

u t THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
O
&
We continue to project a pickup in the pace of output growth over the next two
l
e
v
e years, but we have tempered the acceleration somewhat in this projection. We now
D
n expect GDP growth to move up from 2 percent in 2014 to 2.7 percent in 2015 and to
o
c
E almost 3 percent in 2016. In 2017, as monetary policy accommodation continues to be
c
t i removed, output growth slows, but at 2¼ percent, it remains above potential.
s
e
m
o
D  The net downward revision to GDP growth is largely a consequence of the
higher path for the dollar as well as the modestly lower path for house prices
assumed in this projection.
 Given the persistent weakness in household spending in recent quarters
relative to our forecasting models, we adjusted the time profile of real PCE
growth. The adjustments included building in a little more sluggishness this
year and next year and then adding a little more strength thereafter to bring the
level of spending more nearly back in line with fundamentals.
 As in previous Tealbooks, we expect that GDP growth will be supported by a
further waning of restraint from changes in fiscal policy and a gradual
expansion in the availability of mortgage credit. Moreover, as activity and
employment continue to strengthen, consumer and business confidence should
improve and provide additional support to spending growth.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
The incoming data suggest that conditions in the labor market continue to
improve, but at a somewhat slower pace than we anticipated in the July Tealbook.
 Gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 180,000 in July and
August—the two reports released since the July Tealbook—well below the
monthly increases of 250,000 that we had been expecting. Some special
factors may have contributed to the shortfall relative to our expectations, but
we nonetheless nudged down our forecast for the average monthly job gain in
Page 14 of 84

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 10, 2014
k
o
o
l
the final four months of this year, from 240,000 in the previous Tealbook to u t
O
220,000 in the current Tealbook.3
&
l
e
v
 The unemployment rate in August stood at 6.1 percent, 0.1 percentage point e
D
above our forecast in the July Tealbook. The labor force participation rate n
o
c
was 62.8 percent in August, in line with our July expectations. E
c
i
t
s
 The preliminary reading on the staff’s labor market conditions index (LMCI), m
e
o
which summarizes the movements in 19 labor market indicators, was up D
slightly over the past two months. Movements in the LMCI continue to
indicate that labor market conditions over the past year have improved by
less than would be inferred from viewing only the decline in the
unemployment rate.
Taking all of this information on board, as well as the weaker outlook for
economic activity, we now anticipate that slack in the labor market will be eliminated
somewhat later than in our previous projection.
 We have nudged down our forecast for monthly job gains, and we now expect
them to average about 190,000 over 2015 and 2016, compared with the
average of around 220,000 that we projected in the July Tealbook. In 2017,
the pace of job gains is expected to slow to about 150,000 per month.
 Over the medium term, the unemployment rate is around 0.4 percentage point
higher than in the previous projection, and it drifts down to 4.9 percent at the
end of 2017, ¼ percentage point below the natural rate.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
In response to faster-than-expected declines in oil prices, we have marked down
our projection for total PCE price inflation in the second half of this year. But otherwise,
the price projection is very similar to the one we presented in the July Tealbook, with
3 Among the special factors, many employees of the Market Basket grocery store chain in New
England were temporarily off payrolls in August due to a labor dispute. In addition, there is some reason to
believe that the August payroll gain was understated. On average over the past decade, August payroll
gains have been revised up by about 60,000 jobs between the first and third readings. (There were
unusually few auto layoffs in July and therefore fewer recalls in August, but this factor washes out over the
two months.)

o
l
u t core PCE price inflation expected to step up gradually over the medium term as resource
O
slack is eliminated.
&
l
e
v
e  The July reading on core PCE prices supported our view that some of the
D
n large price increases in the second quarter would prove to be transitory. In
o
c
E fact, that reading was even a little lower than we expected, leading to a
c
i
t downward revision of ¼ percentage point to our forecast for core inflation in
s
e
m
the current quarter. We took little signal from the July surprise beyond this
o
D
quarter. All told, we now expect core PCE prices to rise at a rate of 1½
percent in both the third and fourth quarters—held down slightly by the traces
of residual seasonality that we find in these data and by lower core import
price inflation.
 With the recent drop in crude oil prices, which has already started to feed
through to lower gasoline prices, we now expect PCE energy prices to
decrease at an annual rate of about 6 percent in the second half of this year, a
larger decline than we had projected in the July Tealbook. Energy prices are
projected to be relatively flat over the remainder of the projection.
 Food price inflation has begun to ease, as favorable crop conditions have
contributed to a marked decline in farm prices. Accordingly, we project PCE
food price inflation to slow to an annual rate of 1½ percent in the second half
of the year from 3 percent in the first half.
 After rising at an annual rate of only ¼ percent in the second quarter, prices of
core imported goods are expected to increase at a still-subdued pace of
½ percent in the second half of 2014, restrained by the ongoing drag from
dollar appreciation. Core import price inflation is then expected to average
around 1¼ percent per year, consistent with moderate foreign inflation and
our projection for only slight dollar depreciation.
 In the medium term, we have revised down slightly the core inflation
projection in response to the wider margin of resource slack. We forecast that
core PCE inflation will edge up 0.1 percentage point per year over the
medium term, reaching 1.8 percent in 2017. Total PCE inflation follows a
similar contour to core inflation, but the fairly flat path of consumer energy

o
l
prices leaves total PCE inflation a touch below core price inflation in each of u t
O
the next three years.
&
l
e
v
 Compensation per hour in the business sector is now estimated to have e
D
increased at a pace of 4½ percent in the first half of this year, 3 percentage n
o
c
points faster than in the July Tealbook. But in light of the extreme volatility E
c
of these estimates and the relatively moderate increases of average hourly t i
s
e
earnings and the employment cost index over the same period, we have m
o
D
interpreted the first-half strength in compensation per hour as broadly
consistent with our forecast of a general acceleration as resources become
more fully utilized.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 Beyond 2017, the federal funds rate continues to be set according to the
prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. This policy rule
assumes a long-run equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of
3¾ percent.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent. The
process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be
completed by 2021. Risk premiums on corporate equities and corporate bonds
edge down toward their longer-run levels.
 The federal budget deficit continues to widen beyond 2017, primarily
reflecting fast-rising transfer payments for retirement and health-care
programs. The ratio of federal debt to GDP is about 73 percent in 2018 and
edges up thereafter.
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar moves down about 1¼ percent
in 2018 and stays constant after that. The price of crude oil holds steady in
real terms. Foreign real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 3 percent from
2018 to 2020.
 The natural rate of unemployment is 5.2 percent, and potential GDP rises
around 2 percent per year on average from 2018 to 2020.

 With the output above its potential level, the federal funds rate is slightly
O
& above its longer-run value in 2019.
l
e
v
e  As monetary policy accommodation is being withdrawn, real GDP slows to a
D
n touch below 2 percent in 2018 and then continues to run for a while slightly
o
c
E below the assumed growth rate of potential output. The unemployment rate
c
t i stays flat at just under 5 percent in 2018 before gradually edging up toward its
s
e
m
natural rate.
o
D
 Consumer price inflation remains a bit below the long-term objective of the
Committee at the end of 2017. However, with the unemployment rate below
the natural rate, longer-run inflation expectations gradually move up to the
Committee’s target, and consumer price inflation reaches 2 percent by 2019.

unemployment rate, while projections for other variables, including the labor force participation rate and payroll employment, were prepared only
through 2014. This exhibit therefore reports a 2015 projection from the September 2012 Tealbook only for the unemployment rate.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Real GDP growth in the foreign economies edged up from 2 percent in the first
quarter to 2¼ percent in the second. Growth rebounded strongly in Canada, China, and
Mexico, supported by a reversal of the first-quarter weakness in exports. In contrast, the
Japanese economy contracted sharply following the April 1 tax increase, activity
stagnated in the euro area, and the Brazilian economy fell into recession. Although the
euro-area economy was significantly weaker than expected, upward surprises in some
other countries, including Canada and Mexico, left total foreign growth in the second
k
o
quarter only slightly below our July estimate. o
l
t
u
O
We continue to expect foreign growth to rise to a 3 percent pace in the second half &
l
of this year. Along with the recovery of the Japanese economy from its tax-induced e
v
e
slump, we expect some firming of growth in the euro area and emerging Asia and a D
n
modest resumption of growth in Brazil. Foreign growth should then settle around o
c
E
3¼ percent over the next three years as monetary policies in the advanced foreign l
’
t
n
economies (AFEs) remain supportive. I
Inflation has stayed very low in the euro area and inflation expectations have
declined, leading the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates and announce
plans to purchase private assets. With euro-area inflation expected to remain
significantly below the 2 percent target, the ECB is projected to keep its policy rate near
zero through 2017. (See the box “Euro Area: Inflation Developments and Outlook.”)
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) also is likely to keep its policy rate near zero as inflation
remains below target. In contrast, in other major AFEs, with inflation approaching
2 percent and economic slack diminishing, policy stimulus is likely to be gradually
withdrawn: We assume that tightening will begin early next year in the United Kingdom
and around the middle of the year in Canada.
We are attentive to several risks to the foreign outlook. In the euro area,
disappointing growth and persistently low inflation raise the possibility that the recovery
will stagnate, which could prompt the ECB to respond with a full-blown asset purchase
program that includes government bonds. Another downside risk is the possibility that
geopolitical tensions, especially an escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, will disrupt world
energy and financial markets. (These two scenarios are explored in the Risks and

Euro Area: Inflation Developments and Outlook
Twelve-month headline inflation in the euro area has declined further this year, falling
to 0.3 percent in August (see the upper-left figure on the following page). In
peripheral Europe, inflation rates have fallen into negative territory, posing concerns
that a debt-deflation spiral could derail the fragile recovery. Market measures of
inflation expectations have moved down as well. As shown in the upper-right figure
on the following page, five-year inflation expectations had been declining for some
time, and they fell dramatically in August. Similarly, inflation expectations between
5 and 10 years ahead—the ECB’ s preferred measure of inflation expectations—
drifted lower this year before dropping to below 2 percent in August (a development
k
o seen only twice before). Thus, financial markets appear to be giving greater weight
o
l to the possibility that inflation will remain persistently below the ECB’s objective and,
t
u
O more generally, to the risks of deflation, which have pushed down euro-area bond
& yields (not shown). This pessimism has been reinforced by the slackening of the
e l already anemic pace of the economic recovery, reflected in the second quarter’s flat
v
e GDP and the weakness of more recent indicators.
D
n
o To address these mounting concerns, in June the ECB cut its policy rates, announced
c
E
targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and said it would explore purchases of
l
’
n t asset-backed securities (ABS). With the outlook continuing to flag, the ECB surprised
I
markets at its September 4 meeting by again cutting interest rates and pledging to
begin purchasing ABS and covered bonds in October.1 We expect that these actions
will support the euro-area recovery and thereby contribute to a reduction in slack
and a firming of core and headline inflation rates (lower-left figure on the following
page).
Given the steady deterioration of the inflation outlook in the past few years, our
projection that this trend will reverse might seem optimistic. However, a simple
accounting decomposition of quarterly headline inflation into energy, food, and core
inflation (shown in the lower-right figure on the following page) suggests that much
of the weakness since the third quarter of last year can be explained by a sharp fall in
food and energy prices (particularly of natural gas), as the supply outlook for crops
improved and unusually warm winter weather depressed energy consumption.
Going forward, with food and energy prices bottoming out, headline inflation should
rise toward core, which has held much steadier in recent quarters. Moreover, it bears
noting that the declines in inflation that have occurred this year are evident only
when inflation is measured on a 12-month basis. When measured on a quarterly
basis, inflation has been moving up since it had fallen to near zero in late 2013; data
through August suggest that quarterly headline inflation should rise to about
¾ percent in the current quarter.
1 The ECB will announce details of this asset purchase program at its October policy
meeting.

Our expectations-augmented Phillips curve models, which explicitly consider the role
of other factors such as economic slack and inflation expectations, support the
importance of supply shocks (proxied by changes in oil and import prices) in
restraining euro-area inflation since the end of 2013.2 The disappointing performance
of the euro-area economy in the first two quarters of this year, which unexpectedly
widened output gaps, also contributes, albeit modestly, to lower inflation than our
model predicted earlier in the year. With growth projected to pick up, output gaps
should narrow, which should also lend some slight impetus to inflation.
However, uncertainty about the outlook for the euro area remains significant, as still-
elevated debt levels and high unemployment rates continue to weigh on the fragile
recovery. Accordingly, there is some risk that the euro-area economy could
k
experience a prolonged period of disappointing growth and low inflation, o
o
l
necessitating further monetary policy stimulus. This scenario is explored in the Risks t
u
O
and Uncertainty section.

2 As discussed in the January 2014 Tealbook box “Inflation Developments in the Advanced
Foreign Economies,” our inflation models relate quarterly headline inflation to a measure of longer-
term inflation expectations, the staff’s estimate of the output gap, changes in consumption taxes, a

Uncertainty section.) Finally, the possibility of a financial crisis in China remains on the
table.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Euro area. Euro-area GDP was flat in the second quarter, a substantially
weaker outcome than estimated in the July Tealbook, as output contracted in
Germany and Italy. Although the negative surprise is partly explained by
transitory factors, more recent data also point to somewhat less underlying
strength, with retail sales in July below their second-quarter level and the
k
o composite PMI softening through August. Accordingly, we expect GDP to
o
t l grow at only a 1 percent pace in the second half of this year before firming to
u
O
a still-subdued 2 percent rate in 2016 and 2017, supported by accommodative
&
l monetary policy.
e
v
e
D
With data through August in hand, we estimate that inflation will move up
n
o
c from 0.4 percent in the second quarter to ¾ percent in the current quarter, and
E
l
t ’ we project an increase to 1½ percent by the end of 2016 as the output gap
n
I
narrows. Nevertheless, market-based inflation expectations have fallen as
economic data have been disappointing. In response to these developments,
the ECB surprised markets by cutting its key policy rates 10 basis points at its
September meeting, reducing its main refinancing rate to 0.05 percent and the
rate on its deposit facility to negative 0.2 percent. The ECB also announced
that, starting in October, it will purchase asset-backed securities and covered
bonds; our working assumption is that purchases will total about €300 billion.
We estimate that these measures will add ¼ percent to GDP after two years
and nearly 0.1 percentage point to inflation. We assume that the ECB will
keep its main refinancing rate unchanged through the end of 2017.
 United Kingdom. The U.K. economy continues to grow at a solid rate,
although recent manufacturing PMI and retail sales data suggest some
moderation from the robust 3¼ percent pace of the first half of the year. We
see growth averaging 2¾ percent in the second half before stabilizing at a
near-trend pace of 2½ percent thereafter. We expect U.K. inflation to remain
around 2 percent over the forecast period. With the output gap narrowing and
inflation near target, we still see the Bank of England (BOE) hiking rates
fairly soon. However, we have pushed back our assumption for when liftoff
Page 32 of 84

--- Page 36 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 10, 2014
will occur by one quarter to the first quarter of 2015, largely in response to the
dovish tone of the August Inflation Report, in which the BOE suggested that
recent subdued wage growth could indicate more slack than previously
thought. The possibility that Scotland could choose to be an independent
country in the September 18 referendum is a risk to the outlook for the U.K.
economy and for monetary policy.
 Japan. We expect GDP to rise at a 2 percent pace in the second half of this
year as the economy rebounds from April’s tax hike. In addition to the
normalization of private consumption, second-half growth is supported by a
k
substantial rise in public spending aimed at partially offsetting the effects of o
o
l
the tax increase. Growth should slow to an average pace of 1 percent over the u t
O
remainder of the forecast period, partly reflecting drag from another tax hike
&
planned for October 2015. Removing the effect of April’s tax hike, inflation e l
v
e
has been running about 1¼ percent in recent months, and we see it edging up D
n
to 1½ percent by the end of the forecast period. With growth slowing and o
c
E
inflation well below target, we continue to anticipate that the BOJ will step up
l
’
t
the pace of asset purchases in early 2015. n
I
 Canada. GDP growth rebounded more than we had expected in the second
quarter, to 3.1 percent, after having been held to just 0.9 percent in the first
quarter by severe winter weather and weak U.S. demand. Recent data,
including exports in July and the manufacturing PMI in August, were also
stronger than we had expected. We now see GDP growth in the second half
of this year at 2¾ percent, a touch above the July Tealbook projection.
Thereafter, we forecast GDP growth to slow to a near-potential pace of
2¼ percent by 2017 as monetary stimulus is gradually withdrawn. July
inflation data showed an easing of energy prices, supporting our forecast that
headline inflation will slow to 1½ percent in the second half of this year, after
which it should move up to average about 2 percent. We still expect that the
Bank of Canada will begin raising its target for the overnight interest rate in
the third quarter of 2015.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Recent data suggest that Chinese GDP growth has moderated a bit, as
expected, from 7¾ percent in the second quarter. Although exports were
Page 33 of 84

--- Page 37 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 10, 2014
surprisingly strong in July and August, other indicators for July, including
industrial production, investment, and retail sales, decelerated more than
expected. Responding to the somewhat weaker momentum in domestic
demand, we marked down growth a touch beyond the current quarter. All
told, we see GDP growth edging down to 7½ percent in the second half of the
year and moderating further to just under 7 percent in 2017. In our baseline
forecast, the ongoing softening in property prices and credit growth serves to
reduce financial imbalances and promote longer-term financial stability.
However, there is some chance that these trends could intensify, leading to
more severe financial stresses and a much sharper decline in real growth.
k
o
o Inflation was very low in the first half of the year, reflecting food and fuel
l
t
u
O price declines. We expect inflation to pick up to 3½ percent in the current
&
quarter as these declines are partly reversed, and then to settle at 3 percent
l
e
v over the remainder of the forecast period.
e
D
n
o  Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth in the rest of emerging Asia picked
c
E
l up to 3¼ percent in the second quarter from 2½ percent in the first, as exports
’
t
n
I generally rebounded from the first-quarter slump and, in some economies,
domestic demand strengthened. Notably, in Thailand, an abatement of
political tensions led to a rebound in GDP after a sharp first-quarter
contraction, and in India higher government spending supported vigorous
growth. In contrast, real GDP fell unexpectedly in Hong Kong, reflecting a
shortfall in tourism from China and weakness in the construction sector.
Growth also weakened in Korea as April’s ferry disaster depressed consumer
sentiment, prompting the government to unveil a fiscal stimulus package and
the Bank of Korea to loosen monetary policy. The overall tone of more recent
indicators for the region, including exports, PMIs, and industrial production,
has been positive; we expect growth to rise to 4 percent in the second half of
the year and to average 4¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast.
 Latin America. After a prolonged period of weakness, Mexican GDP surged
4¼ percent in the second quarter, 1¼ percentage points faster than forecast in
the July Tealbook. The rebound of U.S. activity helped boost Mexican
exports, the construction sector continued to recover, and the fiscal drag from
the tax hikes in early 2014 appeared to wane. We have GDP growth
averaging a solid 3¾ percent over the forecast period, as U.S. manufacturing

--- Page 38 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) September 10, 2014
activity remains robust, the construction sector continues to recover, and
structural reforms begin to pay off. Inflation is projected to average a little
above 3 percent.
 Brazil’s economy fell into recession in the first half of the year. Real GDP
contracted at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter, and first-
quarter growth was revised down into negative territory. The second-quarter
contraction was due primarily to a sharp drop in investment as uncertainty
about the outcome of next month’s elections lowered confidence and
exacerbated existing weakness in capital expenditures. Based on recent
k
increases in exports and industrial production, we expect growth to resume in o
o
l
the current quarter, but at only a ½ percent pace. With the economy u t
O
exhibiting weaker momentum than we previously assessed, we lowered the
&
growth path going forward. We estimate that inflation stepped down to e l
v
e
6 percent in the current quarter as the World Cup pressures on service prices D
n
dissipated. We expect inflation to remain high over the remainder of the o
c
E
forecast period, averaging 5¼ percent.
l
’
t
n
I
 Other Emerging Market Economies. The economies of Russia and Ukraine
appear to be suffering as the result of the conflict in Ukraine. In recent weeks,
tensions escalated again: Russia deployed military troops in eastern Ukraine,
Western nations increased sanctions on Russia, and Russia retaliated by
banning imports of some food products from the West. Ukraine’s government
signed a cease-fire agreement with the separatists on September 5, but there
have been reports of sporadic fighting. We expect the situation to remain
volatile and the economies of Russia and Ukraine to remain weak over the
next several quarters. Late last month, the IMF approved the disbursement of
$1.4 billion to Ukraine, the second tranche of the Stand-By Arrangement
approved in April, but warned that the ongoing crisis poses risks for the
program.

Financial Developments
Domestic financial market reactions to incoming news on economic activity,
monetary policy, and geopolitical events were each relatively small and mainly offsetting
over the intermeeting period. Broad measures of domestic equity prices edged up over
the period, as market participants apparently interpreted incoming data on U.S. economic
activity as, on balance, somewhat better than expected. Yields on nominal Treasury
securities were also up a touch, likely boosted by Federal Reserve communications that
were seen as pointing to slightly less accommodation than had been expected. However,
disappointing news on economic activity in Europe and growing expectations for further
monetary accommodation from the ECB appear to have put some downward pressure on
nominal Treasury yields. The conflict in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions weighed
on market sentiment at times but appeared to have only small net effects over the period.
 The S&P 500 index was up 1 percent over the period. Corporate bond spreads
were roughly unchanged, on net, as high-yield bonds recovered from a sharp
selloff early in the intermeeting period.
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities were up 1 to 7 basis points across the
yield curve, and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation declined s
t
n
amid lower oil prices and lower-than-expected data on CPI inflation. e
m
p
o
l
 Yields on the sovereign debt of European economies continued to decline e
v
e
over the intermeeting period, as expectations for euro-area growth and D
l
a
inflation fell and as market participants increased their expectations for i
c
n
monetary accommodation abroad. The broad index of the dollar appreciated a
n
i
about 1¾ percent over the period, with solid gains against most currencies. F
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained quite favorable.
However, financing conditions for households were mixed: Auto loans were
widely available, standards and terms for credit card lending were tight but
eased somewhat, and access to residential mortgages remained limited for all
but those with excellent credit histories.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
Yields on nominal Treasury securities edged higher, on balance, over the period.
Rates might have been expected to rise a few basis points, as the passage of time brought
the expected date of the first increase in the federal funds rate closer.1 U.S. economic
data were, on balance, reportedly seen by Treasury market participants as about in line
with expectations. Some market participants pointed to the declines in yields in other
advanced economies, especially those in the euro area, as having put some downward
pressure on U.S. Treasury yields. In addition, TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation declined over the intermeeting period, particularly in the near term,
reportedly reflecting the lower-than-expected inflation readings from the July CPI data
and a decline in oil prices. Geopolitical risk, including the tensions in Ukraine and the
Middle East, also appeared to boost demand for Treasury securities and weigh on their
yields at times, but the net effect appears to have been small.
Federal Reserve communications were, on balance, interpreted as signaling
slightly less accommodative monetary policy than had been expected. In particular,
although the July FOMC statement was viewed as generally in line with expectations, the
July minutes were seen as modestly less accommodative. Market participants reportedly
focused especially on the indication that policymakers generally agreed that the recent
improvement in labor market conditions had been greater than anticipated. The
s
t
n
discussion of normalization also garnered attention but reportedly did not materially e
m
affect market pricing. The Chair’s speech at the Jackson Hole economic policy p
o
l
e
symposium was interpreted as consistent with the message from the minutes. v
e
D
l
The path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market a
i
c
n
quotes was essentially unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period.2 However, half a
n
i
of the respondents to the September primary dealer survey pointed to the second quarter F
of 2015 as the most likely date for liftoff, with the other half pointing to the third quarter
or later, and the distribution of the modal timing of the first rate increase has shifted
slightly toward earlier dates. The median dealer’s projection for the longer-run level of
1 Treasury yields reflect both the expected average level of short-term policy rates inside the
maturity “window” of the Treasury security and a term premium. As the expected date of policy liftoff
approaches, the maturity window moves further into the period during which short-term rates are expected
to rise. This movement, by itself, puts upward pressure on Treasury yields.
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

the federal funds rate is 3.5 percent, unchanged from the July survey, while the median
expected spread between the ON RRP and IOER rates immediately following liftoff
increased from 20 basis points in the July survey to 25 basis points in September,
consistent with the normalization discussion in the July FOMC minutes.
EQUITY PRICES AND BOND SPREADS
Broad measures of domestic equity prices were up a bit over the intermeeting
period, as equity market investors appeared to interpret the incoming economic data as
providing more evidence that the economic recovery is gaining traction. Geopolitical
tensions appeared to be a drag on stock prices at times, and market volatility moved up
notably early in the period. However, this increase was short lived, and measures of
realized and implied equity price volatility were little changed, on net, over the period.
The spreads between yields on corporate bonds and those on comparable-maturity
Treasury securities were about unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period.
High-yield bond mutual funds experienced sharp outflows early in the period, and
spreads on such bonds widened noticeably. However, spreads subsequently reversed, and
such bond funds have attracted modest inflows in recent weeks. Measures of liquidity in
the corporate bond market remained stable in the face of these substantial flows, and
responses to the most recent Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing

Over the intermeeting period, market participants shifted attention away from
geopolitical risks toward weaker-than-expected data releases abroad as well as actual and
prospective easing in the stance of monetary policy in the euro area. Sovereign yields in
European economies declined, and euro-area peripheral spreads narrowed substantially
on net. Near- to medium-term inflation expectations in the euro area, which have been
trending down for some time, declined substantially in August. The shift in monetary
policy expectations supported equity prices, with broad foreign indexes generally ending
the period somewhat higher, and contributed to an appreciation in the broad index of the
foreign exchange value of the dollar.

ECB President Mario Draghi’s Jackson Hole remarks were read as more
accommodative than expected, and the ECB subsequently announced a cut of 10 basis
points in both its main refinancing rate, to 0.05 percent, and its deposit rate, to negative
0.2 percent. In addition, the ECB pledged to begin purchasing asset-backed securities
and covered bonds in October. The euro depreciated more than 1 percent immediately
following the ECB announcement. Over the period, German 2-year government bond
yields declined about 10 basis points to negative 7 basis points. German yields are now
negative out to maturities of 3 years. Meanwhile, 10-year sovereign bond yields for the
peripheral European economies moved to record lows, and spreads on those securities
continued to narrow.
Following the release of the BOE’s Inflation Report, which highlighted the
weakness of recent wage growth, near-term policy expectations moved lower.
Government bond yields in the United Kingdom also fell over the period. In early
September, the pound depreciated sharply against the dollar and implied pound–dollar
volatility spiked after polls on the Scottish independence referendum to be held on
September 18 showed an increase in the probability of secession.
The broad index of the dollar rose about 1¾ percent over the period. Weaker-
than-expected foreign data, more accommodative monetary policy expectations in
advanced foreign economies, and the Scottish referendum polls contributed to an increase s
t
n
of about 3 percent in the major currency index over the period. In addition to the large e

BUSINESS FINANCE
Financing conditions for domestic businesses stayed favorable during the
intermeeting period. Corporate bond issuance slowed in July and August amid a fairly
typical summer lull, and elevated volatility in the high-yield bond market early in the
intermeeting period may also have restrained issuance a bit. However, issuance

rebounded strongly in the first week of September. The level of nonfinancial commercial
paper outstanding rose noticeably over the intermeeting period, while commercial and
industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books continued to grow robustly. Supervisory data
suggest that the growth in C&I loans during the second quarter was broad based across
major industries, including strong growth in loans to core sectors such as manufacturing,
trade, and transportation.
Issuance of leveraged loans has remained robust in recent months. Although
demand for such loans by retail investors—typically through mutual funds—has been
slowly declining since the beginning of the year, CLO managers continue to be a strong
source of demand for newly issued loans, and CLO issuance has stayed quite rapid.
Standards and terms for leveraged loans have reportedly stabilized but remain relatively
loose.
Despite favorable equity market valuations, gross equity issuance slowed in July
and continued to be subdued in August, mostly reflecting summer seasonal patterns.
However, the number of pending IPOs is large, and venture capital funding in the second
quarter was at its highest level since 2001.
Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease.
Underwriting standards on CMBS reportedly eased further amid strong competition
s
t
n
among lenders, and issuers reportedly have been engaging in increased “rating e
m
shopping.” The volume of CMBS issuance remained robust in July and August, and p
o
l
unusually strong origination volumes are expected over the next few months. CRE loans e

Financing conditions for households were mixed over the intermeeting period:
Auto loans were widely available, standards and terms for credit card lending were tight
but eased somewhat, and access to residential mortgages remained limited for all but
those with excellent credit histories.
Auto loans stayed widely available to consumers, including to those with
subprime credit records. While the credit performance of auto loans, on balance, has held
up well in recent quarters, it has worsened somewhat for lenders with more exposure to

subprime borrowers. Some of these lenders have reportedly started to rein in lending to
individuals with very poor credit histories.
Standards and terms for credit card lending remained tight, on balance, in recent
quarters but continued to ease somewhat. During the second quarter, the median credit
score of newly opened revolving accounts edged down further, and spreads of interest
rates offered in credit card mailings over yields on Treasury securities, though still
elevated, narrowed somewhat. Partly reflecting such continuing improvements in
financing conditions, credit card lending advanced further in July, leaving the outstanding
balance of such loans at its highest level in four years, although it remains about
14 percent below the peak level seen prior to the financial crisis. Delinquency rates on
credit card debt stayed at historically low levels.
Measures of financing conditions for residential mortgages were little changed
over the intermeeting period. Although conditions remained tight, they have eased some
over the past year. Total mortgage balances on household credit reports declined at an
annual rate of about 3 percent in the second quarter as new mortgage originations
continued to be subdued; more timely indicators of purchase and refinance activity stayed
at low levels through September 5. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were
little changed at about 4 percent, approximately 50 basis points below last fall’s highs.

compressed margins being driven by continued low interest rates as well as increased

at commercial banks that are subject to the standard liquidity coverage ratio requirement
have risen $100 billion thus far this year. Through the second quarter (the latest data
available), the bulk of the increase occurred in medium- and longer-term maturities.
Loan performance at banks continued to improve in the second quarter, as delinquencies
fell across most loan types.

M2 expanded at a 5½ percent annual rate over July and August, in line with
growth during the first half of the year. The monetary base rose at an annual rate of
about 20 percent over the intermeeting period, as the end of the most recent tests of the
Term Deposit Facility led to a shift of funds from the facility back into reserve balances.3
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Unsecured overnight funding markets were stable during the intermeeting period.
Rates for triparty Treasury repo among counterparties that are eligible to participate in
the ON RRP exercise and rates for GCF Treasury repo declined somewhat over the
period but, for the most part, remained above the fixed rate offered in the ON RRP
exercise.
As a result of somewhat lower market repo rates, ON RRP take-up, on average,
was a little higher than in the prior intermeeting period. Money market funds have
continued to be major and stable participants in the ON RRP exercise, with daily average
usage of $122 billion as of September 9. Total take-up was significantly higher on the
last trading day of July and modestly higher on the last trading day of August than it had
been in the days just prior to those dates. Prime money funds, in particular, more than
doubled their take-up on these month-ends relative to adjacent days.

In outright open market operations, the Federal Reserve purchased $20 billion in n t

3 As part of the continuing program of operational testing of policy tools, the Federal Reserve
announced, on September 4, plans to conduct a series of eight consecutive seven-day term deposit
operations through the Term Deposit Facility beginning in October. The term deposits in these operations
will include an early withdrawal feature, subject to a penalty. Market participants noted that the early
withdrawal feature will likely increase demand for term deposits because it will allow banks to count these
balances as high-quality liquid assets in the calculation of their liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs). The LCR
requirement will be phased in starting early next year, but it has reportedly already begun to affect banks’
behavior.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the extent of uncertainty around our projections for real
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable
volatility. As always, a number of upside and downside risks attend our forecast for
economic activity; importantly, however, we see neither monetary policy nor fiscal
policy as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.
Consequently, we continue to believe that the risks to our forecast for real GDP growth
are tilted a little to the downside. By contrast, we continue to view the risks around our
projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher
unemployment rate from adverse demand-side developments largely countered by the
possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to surprise us to the downside.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance assessment. The assessment delivered in July saw the
vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks as moderate in general, albeit
building slightly. Overall, this assessment reflected the modest use of leverage in most
parts of the financial sector, low-to-moderate levels of maturity and credit transformation
in the financial sector, and the lack of acceleration in borrowing by the nonfinancial
sector as a whole. That said, the assessment also indicated that the risks to the financial
system associated with an abrupt market shift had stepped up as a result of unusually
subdued levels of actual and implied volatilities in a range of markets, the continued
deterioration of underwriting standards for leveraged loans, and increased asset valuation
pressures—especially for some fixed-income securities.
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. Measures of long-term
inflation expectations have remained stable in recent years despite fluctuations in the y
t
n
prices of crude oil, other commodities, and imports more generally, and also despite the i
a
t
r
deep recession and subsequent slack in labor and product markets. Furthermore, we view e
c
n
the risks to our inflation forecast as balanced. On the downside, there is the possibility U
&
that the lengthy run of inflation below the Committee’s 2 percent objective could prove

term inflation expectations move down or if low levels of resource utilization persist
longer or have larger effects than we currently project. On the upside, an increase in
inflation expectations—potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of
policy—could cause inflation to rise. Inflation could also move up as a result of
significant unanticipated increases in the prices of oil and other commodities caused by
overseas developments, a stronger-than-expected economic recovery, or a larger amount
of damage to the supply side of the economy than is assumed in the baseline.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first two
scenarios, the economy is hit by temporary supply shocks that boost inflation. In the first
variant, long-term inflation expectations remain on their baseline path; in the second,
long-term inflation expectations become unanchored and move up, leading to a much
more persistent increase in inflation. In the third scenario, slack in labor markets is much
greater than we have assumed in the baseline, reflecting a stronger trend in labor force
participation. The fourth scenario features a deeper and more protracted reduction in
potential output growth than assumed in the baseline. In the fifth scenario, weaker-than-
expected growth in the euro area and very low core inflation prompt the ECB to
markedly expand its program of asset purchases. The final scenario assumes that
geopolitical tensions intensify further, causing oil prices to rise, global financial
conditions to deteriorate, and household and business confidence to weaken.
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its
effective lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast—by an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using
a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in
the Committee’s recent statements.1 In all cases, we assume that the size and
y
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. t

Higher Inflation with Anchored Inflation Expectations
This scenario and the next compare the effects of a shock to inflation under
alternative assumptions about inflation expectations.2 In this scenario, long-term
inflation expectations evolve according to the staff’s baseline assumption, whereas in the
next, they become unanchored and respond to the realizations of higher inflation.3
In both scenarios, transitory price and wage shocks raise core inflation to
3¼ percent by the end of next year. Assuming that long-term inflation expectations
follow the baseline, as we do in this first scenario, then once the temporary price and
wage shocks fade, core inflation declines quickly and by 2017 runs slightly below
2 percent. The federal funds rate lifts off in the same quarter as in the baseline, and with
inflation substantially higher, reaches 3 percent by the end of 2016, ¾ percentage point
above the baseline. The tighter policy restrains real activity somewhat, and by 2017, the
unemployment rate is about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline projection.
Higher Inflation with Unanchored Inflation Expectations
In this scenario, we apply the same wage and price shocks as in the previous one,
but we allow long-term inflation expectations to become unanchored. In particular, long-
term inflation expectations are assumed to be adaptive. Accordingly, in response to the
shocks that boost wages and prices in the near term, long-term inflation expectations drift
up. As in the previous scenario, the federal funds rate lifts off in the same quarter as in
the baseline. Under the assumed inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, the federal
funds rate remains about ½ percentage point above its baseline path late in the decade.
This response of the federal funds rate, however, raises the unemployment rate only
marginally compared with the previous scenario, which is not sufficiently aggressive to
make much progress in returning inflation to the Committee’s objective over this horizon,
with actual inflation remaining elevated through 2019. At that time, the policy rule
similar policy rule to the one used in the first four scenarios. One key difference relative to the FRB/US
simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual
output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment
of wages and prices.

balances an inflation rate running ½ percentage point above target against an
unemployment rate that is ¼ percentage point above its natural rate.
Higher Trend Labor Force Participation Rate
The staff baseline assumes that most of the 3 percentage point decline in the labor
force participation rate since the beginning of the Great Recession reflects structural
factors, and attributes only about ½ percentage point of the decline to cyclical factors. It
is possible, however, that some of the changes that the staff associates with structural
factors—such as the increase in retirements and school enrollment—may in part be
related to the recession and subsequent sluggish recovery and may reverse in a strong
labor market. Reflecting the wide range of estimates on the cyclical shortfall in the labor
force participation rate, this scenario assumes that structural factors have been less
important in accounting for the decline in the labor force participation rate.4 In particular,
we assume the current level of the labor force participation rate is about 1½ percentage
points below its trend level, compared with ½ percentage point in the baseline, implying
more slack in labor and product markets.
In this reinterpretation of aggregate supply conditions, the unemployment rate
overstates the overall improvement in the labor market to a much greater extent than in
the baseline. As the labor force participation rate rises toward its higher trend level, the
unemployment rate moves about ½ percentage point above baseline by 2016. The
unemployment rate remains above the assumed threshold for liftoff of the federal funds
rate for an additional five quarters. The extended period of monetary policy
accommodation boosts spending, and real GDP rises 3½ percent in 2016 and 3 percent in
2017. By mid-2018, this stronger growth is sufficient to pull the unemployment rate
slightly below baseline. Competing forces pull inflation in different directions: While
the initially higher unemployment rate tends to hold down inflation, the high degree of
monetary policy accommodation boosts short-term inflation expectations in the FRB/US
model. On net, inflation is a little above the baseline, with core inflation at 1¾ percent in
2016 and almost 2 percent in 2017.

No Room to Grow
Some of the models we consult suggest that potential output may be lower than is
assumed in the baseline projection and may grow more slowly in the future. In this
scenario, we assume that structural productivity gains in recent years have been slower
than the staff currently estimates and continue to be so over the projection period, and
that the natural rate of unemployment has been constant at 6¼ percent since early 2011
and will remain at that level in the future. With these assumptions, potential output has
expanded at an annual rate of only 1 percent since 2011; looking ahead, it rises at only a
1¼ percent pace through 2019. As a consequence of this revision to potential output, the
output gap is estimated to be closed by the current quarter.
Compared with the baseline, real GDP growth is substantially slower as
households and firms base their spending on lower levels and rates of growth of
permanent income and potential output. Inflation is higher than in the baseline, reflecting
the effects of both tighter resource utilization and smaller productivity gains, which
contribute to greater cost pressures. The unemployment rate begins to move up by
early 2017 but still has not risen to the higher assumed natural rate of 6¼ percent by the
end of 2019. Inflation is about 2¼ percent in that year. Given enough time, the Taylor
rule governing the setting of the federal funds rate would eventually drive the
unemployment rate above its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to
2 percent.
Weaker Growth in the Euro Area
Although our baseline forecast projects a noticeable pickup in euro-area GDP
growth relative to its languid pace in the first half of this year, the euro-area economy
faces substantial downside risks. This scenario assumes that some of these downside
risks materialize—with euro-area core inflation drifting lower, confidence weakening,
and financial conditions tightening modestly—and that these developments in turn
prompt the ECB to implement large-scale purchases of euro-area sovereign bonds.
These asset purchases are assumed to begin later this year and eventually cumulate to
y €1 trillion. Notwithstanding this aggressive monetary easing and a 5 percent depreciation

of the euro against the dollar, real GDP in the euro area still falls about 2 percent below
baseline by the end of 2016.5
The weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar in turn cause U.S. real net
exports to fall relative to the baseline. Nevertheless, given that financial spillovers to
economies outside of Europe are quite limited in this scenario, the overall impact on the
U.S. economy is modest.6 All told, U.S. real GDP expands roughly 2¼ percent in 2015,
½ percentage point less than in the baseline. With a higher unemployment rate, the
federal funds rate lifts off one quarter later than in the baseline.
Escalating Geopolitical Tensions
Tensions between Russia and Ukraine thus far have left only a small imprint on
global markets. In this scenario, we consider a major and sustained escalation in
tensions—involving the imposition of additional sanctions on Russia by the West and
Russian counter actions—which severely affect global energy markets and also have
sizable spillovers to global financial markets and confidence. We assume that this crisis
persists for about a year before gradually easing.
These developments affect the global economy through a number of channels.
First, this scenario assumes a deep curtailment of Russian oil exports, causing global oil
prices to jump more than $40 per barrel and to remain high for the next year. Second,
Russia cuts off natural gas exports to Europe. Finally, consumer and investor confidence
fall and financial market conditions deteriorate noticeably, with corporate and household
borrowing spreads rising and flight-to-safety flows boosting the dollar. In response, real
GDP in the advanced foreign economies falls about 2½ percent relative to the baseline by
the end of next year, with Europe suffering disproportionately because of its closer
financial and economic ties to Russia. Real GDP in the emerging market economies falls
about 3½ percent relative to the baseline by the end of next year as declining capital
inflows contribute to a marked tightening of financial conditions.

5 The specification of the ECB large-scale asset purchase program is similar to the one discussed a i
t
in the June 2014 Tealbook IEDO box titled “ECB Policy Actions and Options.” In our current scenario, e r
c
the ECB asset purchases attenuate the fall in euro-area GDP by about 1½ percent by the end of 2016 and n
U
increases core inflation by about ¼ percentage point.
&
6 Considered in isolation, the large-scale asset purchases by the ECB are estimated to have a small

positive effect on U.S. GDP, since the effects of stronger economic activity in the euro area on U.S. real net k

exports slightly outweigh the contractionary effects of dollar appreciation. R i

U.S. real activity is depressed as higher oil prices reduce disposable income and
the return to investment. Real net exports decline markedly in response to weaker
foreign activity and an appreciation of the broad real dollar. These adverse effects are
reinforced by a rise in corporate borrowing costs and a decline in confidence. All told,
U.S. real GDP growth is less than 1½ percent in 2015, and the unemployment rate
remains above 5¾ percent through mid-2016. Core inflation falls little relative to the
baseline, as the upward impetus from higher oil prices is offset by weaker activity and a
stronger dollar. Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective
lower bound until late 2016.

the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.
