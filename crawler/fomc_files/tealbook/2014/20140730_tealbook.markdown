Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information we have received since the June Tealbook suggests to us that D
n
slack in the economy is being taken up somewhat more quickly than we anticipated in o
c
E
our previous projection. On its face, this assertion may seem difficult to square with the
c
i
t
growth of real GDP over the first half of the year, which has been even more feeble than e s
m
we expected in the June Tealbook. However, a range of other indicators portray a o
D
stronger profile of economic activity: Payrolls have risen faster than we had projected,
the unemployment rate declined another 0.2 percentage point in June, industrial
production has posted steady gains in recent months, and the readings from business
surveys have been quite strong. Given these considerations, together with our skepticism
about the level of health-care spending shown in the national income and product
accounts thus far this year, we judge that the weakness in real GDP in the first half of the
year largely reflects a combination of statistical noise and transitory influences that will
not persist into the second half.
We continue to expect a stronger pace of economic growth over the medium term,
as some of the forces that have restrained the expansion in recent years recede. Our
current forecast anticipates that real GDP will increase at a 3½ percent annual rate over
the second half of this year and then rise 3 percent in 2015 and in 2016. The average
pace of growth over the next two and a half years is just a little lower than in the June
Tealbook.
We have taken some signal from the fact that the unemployment rate once again
surprised us to the downside—continuing a string of forecast errors in that direction—and
we have lowered our unemployment forecast over the projection period.1 We now
project that the unemployment rate will move down from 6 percent in the current quarter
to 4¾ percent by the end of 2016—the latter value being about ½ percentage point below
our estimate of the natural rate. To bring the GDP gap into closer alignment with the
unemployment gap, we cut our assumption for potential output this year. We now have
resource utilization in both product and labor markets reaching normal levels next
summer, three quarters earlier than in the June Tealbook.

u Recent data point to somewhat faster-than-expected increases in both overall and
O
& core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices in the second quarter. In response,
l
e we marked up the core PCE inflation projection for the second half of the year. In the
v
e
D medium term, we revised up our forecast for core inflation 0.1 percentage point in 2015
n
o and in 2016 as a result of the tighter margins of slack in this projection. As a result, core
c
E
PCE inflation is projected to gradually rise from 1.6 percent this year to 1.8 percent in
c
i
t
s 2016. Our forecast for overall PCE inflation is also revised up a little, although we
e
m
o continue to anticipate that it will run slightly below core inflation in both 2015 and 2016.
D
As always, numerous risks surround our outlook. As in the June Tealbook, we
view the uncertainty around our projection for real GDP growth, inflation, and the
unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years, a period that
includes considerable volatility. While we still see the risks to GDP growth as tilted a
little to the downside (largely because neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appear
well positioned to offset substantial adverse shocks to the economy), we consider these
risks to be more nearly balanced than in the June projection. We continue to see the risks
around our outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced. The
exhibit “Forecast Confidence Intervals and Alternative Scenarios” in the Risks and
Uncertainty section presents FRB/US-generated confidence intervals in graphical form
around the baseline forecast.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
• Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are unchanged from the
previous projection. We assume that asset purchases will continue to slow,
concluding in October of this year.
• We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its zero
lower bound in the second quarter of 2015. We construe the roughly two-
quarter lag between the assumed end in asset purchases and the liftoff of the
federal funds rate to be consistent with the Committee’s view, expressed in its
June statement, that “it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target
range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase
program ends.”

o
o
l
t
• Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises at a pace determined by the u
O
prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule. The &
l
mechanical implementation of this rule puts the federal funds rate at an e
v
e
average level of 2.8 percent in the final quarter of 2016, about 50 basis points D
n
higher than in the June Tealbook, mainly reflecting the higher level of o
c
E
resource utilization in this forecast. c
i
t
s
e
m
Other Interest Rates
o
D
• The trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield is generally higher over the
medium term, reflecting the upward adjustment to the assumed path of the
federal funds rate. Our projection continues to call for a significant rise in
Treasury yields primarily because of the movement of the 10-year valuation
window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well
as a gradual waning of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.
• Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium
term have been revised essentially in line with our revisions to the path for the
Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
• Since the June Tealbook, equity prices have come in about in line with our
projection. Our forecast has stock prices rising at an average annual rate of
about 5 percent through 2016, similar to the average pace of nominal GDP
growth.
• We have marked down our forecast for house prices a bit since June, as recent
data have come in on the soft side of our expectations. Overall, we continue
to expect house price appreciation to slow markedly, from nearly 12 percent
last year to 6 percent this year and to about 3½ percent per year in 2015 and
2016.
Fiscal Policy
• Our assumptions for fiscal policy are the same as in the June Tealbook. We
expect the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy changes to shrink from
about 1 percentage point last year to ¼ percentage point this year and to
essentially zero over 2015 and 2016.

u Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
O
& • Foreign real GDP growth is estimated to have risen to an annual rate of about
l
e
v 2½ percent in the second quarter from a 2 percent increase in the first quarter.
e
D
We project foreign growth to improve further, settling at about 3¼ percent
n
o
over the rest of the forecast period, in line with stronger U.S. growth and as
c
E
c foreign monetary policy remains supportive.
i
t
s
e
m
o
• The broad nominal index for the dollar has declined almost ½ percent since
D
the previous Tealbook. Over the forecast period, the broad real dollar is
forecast to depreciate at an annual rate of about 1 percent, ¼ percentage point
less than projected in the previous Tealbook, reflecting the steeper rise in the
federal funds rate in this projection.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $3 per barrel since the time
of the previous Tealbook, closing near $107 per barrel on July 22. Renewed
conflict in Iraq has left no lasting imprint on spot prices, as current Iraqi
production remains unaffected. However, concerns about the longer-term
outlook for the Iraqi oil supply have pushed up futures prices. Consequently,
our forecast for the price of imported oil has been marked up about $3 per
barrel by the end of the forecast period. We project that the price of imported
oil will decline gradually from around $102 per barrel in the current quarter to
$92 per barrel at the end of 2016, a path consistent with futures markets.
• Nonfuel commodity prices are little changed, on net, relative to the June
Tealbook, as a decline in food prices was largely offset by higher prices for
metals. Over the forecast period, we project our overall commodity price
index to remain about flat.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The BEA currently estimates that real GDP fell at an annual rate of nearly
3 percent in the first quarter, a decline 1½ percentage points larger than expected in the
June Tealbook.2 Given the data in hand, we now estimate that real GDP rose 3½ percent
2 On the second day of the upcoming FOMC meeting, the BEA will publish its first estimate of
real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2014 as well as revised estimates for earlier periods. We are not

l
t
in the second quarter, ¾ percentage point less than in the previous forecast. Much of the u
O
downward revision in the first quarter was concentrated in consumer spending for health &
l
services; the BEA has extended the weaker profile of such spending into the second e
v
e
quarter. These estimates are surprising, especially as they seem at odds with the D
n
expansion of health insurance coverage resulting from the Affordable Care Act.3 o
c
E
c
i
More broadly, the weakness in GDP—and GDI—early in the year seems out of t
s
e
m
step with other indicators of economic activity. As a result, we are treating much of the
o
D
reported weakness in GDP as statistical noise that may or may not be revised away in the
future, and, consequently, we have not significantly altered our forecast for GDP growth
over the rest of the year relative to the June projection. We now anticipate increases
averaging 3½ percent in the second half of the year.
• Available data indicate that real PCE rose at an annual rate of about
1½ percent in the first half of 2014—about half the pace expected in the June
Tealbook, reflecting the lower-than-expected trajectory for health-related
spending. As a result, the projection for real PCE growth in the second half of
the year continues to call for solid gains that are consistent with the sector’s
fundamentals, which have come in close to our expectations since the June
Tealbook.
• We continue to be puzzled by the degree of weakness in housing activity over
the past year. However, the latest housing data have been a bit more upbeat
and seem broadly in line with our expectation that activity in this sector will
gradually begin to trend up again.4
• Real spending on equipment and intangibles (E&I) appears to have rebounded
in the second quarter, and orders data point to a moderate further increase this
quarter. Oil and natural gas drilling looks to have surged in the second
expecting these revisions to resolve the conundrum implicit in the BEA’s current estimate of GDP growth
for the first quarter of 2014.
3 Although the BEA has not built any rebound in health expenditures into their current estimates of
spending in April and May, we see a good possibility that the second-quarter Quarterly Services Survey,
which will be available the day after the September Tealbook is published, will reflect such a rebound. If
so, GDP growth in the second quarter would be revised significantly higher than our current estimate, and
we would likely revise up potential GDP commensurately.

Outlook for the Housing Sector,” by Raven Molloy and Kamila Sommer.

u quarter; given the volatility and revision properties of these data, however, our
O
& projection for nonresidential building activity is little revised for the near
l
e term.
v
e
D
n • The data we have received for inventory investment through May were close
o
c
E to our assumptions in the June Tealbook and point to an appreciably faster
c
t i pace of stockbuilding in the second quarter than in the first quarter.
s
e
m
o
D • The external sector subtracted 1½ percentage points from real GDP growth in
the first quarter because of a sharp decline in exports. Both exports and
especially imports appear to have increased vigorously in the second quarter,
and we now estimate that net exports subtracted ⅓ percentage point from real
GDP growth, compared with our estimate of a roughly neutral contribution in
the previous Tealbook. In the third quarter, the contribution of net exports is
expected to turn positive, as import growth drops back to a rate more in line
with the pace of U.S. demand growth.
• Factory output has been a relatively bright spot recently. After having
decelerated in the first quarter, manufacturing production moved up
6¾ percent (annual rate) in the second quarter, about 2½ percentage points
faster than projected in the June Tealbook. Surveys of manufacturers have
been upbeat, on balance, in recent months and are consistent with our
projection for factory output to increase 3½ percent this quarter, about the
same as in the June Tealbook.
POTENTIAL GDP AND THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Absent any adjustments to our supply-side assumptions relative to their settings in
the June Tealbook, our updated estimates of real GDP growth during the first half of this
year would have implied a ½ percentage point wider GDP gap in the second quarter, even
as the unemployment rate gap was 0.1 percentage point narrower than projected. Given
the stronger tenor of a range of other indicators and our doubts about the measurement of
real PCE, we judged the revisions to first-half GDP growth to be uninformative about the
current degree of product-market slack. To show greater consistency in our different
measures of resource utilization, we lowered our estimate of potential GDP in 2014.

• In particular, we lowered potential GDP in 2014 by enough to absorb the u
O
revision to GDP growth in the first half of the year—which we are treating as &
l
being tantamount to measurement error—and to make the output gap a little e
v
e
narrower than in the June Tealbook, in line with our assessment that labor D
n
market conditions are better than we had expected. This adjustment leaves o
c
E
our estimate of potential GDP growth in 2014 at zero. c
i
t
s
e
m
• On its face, this estimate may seem surprising. We do not believe that the
o
D
sustainable productive capacity of the economy actually fell in the first half of
this year or that it will be flat for 2014 as a whole. But confronted with the
choice of letting measurement error either contaminate the GDP gap or the
growth of potential GDP, we chose the latter, as we view it as most important
to provide our best calibration of the degree of slack in the economy. We
project that potential GDP will rise 1¾ percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016,
the same as in the June Tealbook.
• We made no adjustments to the natural rate of unemployment this forecast
round; in particular, we continue to assume that the natural rate moved down
to its long-run level of 5¼ percent in the second quarter of this year.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
Beyond the near term, our real GDP growth outlook has been revised down a
little.
• After rising at an annual rate of 3½ percent over the second half of 2014, real
GDP is expected to increase at a 3 percent pace in 2015 and in 2016. The
small downward revision to 2016, about ¼ percentage point, is a consequence
of the higher interest rates, the modestly lower house prices, and the slightly
higher path for the dollar in this projection.
• Real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 is supported by a further waning of
restraint from changes in fiscal policy and a gradual expansion in the
availability of mortgage credit. Moreover, we expect that, over time,
households and firms will apprehend that the downside risks to the recovery
are diminishing, leading to improved consumer and business confidence and
providing additional support to consumer spending, business investment, and

O
& Expectations Trap.”)
l
e
v
e • The magnitude of the projected step-up in real GDP growth in 2015 relative to
D
n 2014 is exaggerated, in our assessment, by the experience of the first half,
o
c
E which we regard as anomalously low.
c
i
t
s
m e • We project the GDP gap will be eliminated in the third quarter of 2015, three
o
D calendar quarters earlier than in the June Tealbook, and that actual GDP will
be 1¼ percent above potential GDP by the end of 2016, compared with
¾ percent in the previous projection.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
In contrast to the negative surprise to GDP growth, the incoming data suggest that
the labor market has been improving at a somewhat faster pace than anticipated in the
June Tealbook.
• Total nonfarm payrolls rose about 290,000 in June, and, with positive
revisions to April and May, the level of total payrolls in June was 90,000
above our previous Tealbook projection. In response to the stronger-than-
anticipated June employment report, we nudged up our forecast for average
monthly job gains in the third quarter by 25,000, to 250,000.
• The unemployment rate moved down 0.2 percentage point in June, to
6.1 percent; we had expected it to hold steady at 6.3 percent. The
participation rate, which we expected to tick up in June, remained at
62.8 percent for a third consecutive month.
• The staff’s labor market conditions index (LMCI), which summarizes the
movements in 19 labor market indicators, continued to move up in June. That
said, it points to somewhat less improvement in labor market conditions over
the past year than would be indicated by the unemployment rate taken alone.

Overstated the Improvement in Labor Market Conditions? A View from the

Taking all of this information on board, we now anticipate slack in the labor u
O
market to be eliminated somewhat sooner than in our previous projection. &
l
e
v
• The unemployment rate in the second quarter, at 6¼ percent, was 1 percentage D e
n
point above our estimate of its natural rate. The jobless rate is expected to
o
c
decline to the natural rate by the third quarter of 2015 (three calendar quarters E
c
i
earlier than in the previous projection) and to end 2016 at 4¾ percent, s t
e
m
½ percentage point below our estimate of the natural rate.
o
D
• We expect private nonfarm payrolls to increase 240,000 per month, on
average, in the second half of 2014—a touch faster than in the June
projection—and then to settle in at an average monthly pace of a bit over
200,000 in 2015 and in 2016, figures that are little changed from the previous
Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Prices have risen by a bit more than we anticipated at the time of the June
Tealbook. We view some of these higher readings as likely transitory, but we have also
taken a little signal from these surprises for inflation in the coming months. Over the
medium term, our forecast for inflation is slightly higher in 2015 and 2016 than in the
June Tealbook, reflecting the reduced resource slack in this projection.
• With the June producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) data
in hand, we estimate that total PCE prices increased at an annual rate of
2.3 percent in the second quarter (0.3 percentage point higher than our June
Tealbook forecast) and that core PCE prices rose 1.9 percent (0.1 percentage
point higher than the previous forecast).5 In response, we marked up our
inflation projections for the second half of the year. Nevertheless, we still
expect core inflation to step down from the pace of recent readings, in part
reflecting the residual seasonality that we think tends to raise PCE price
inflation slightly in the first half of the year and suppress it in the second half.
For 2014 as a whole, the projection for total PCE inflation revised up
5 We estimate that the four-quarter change in total PCE prices in the second quarter was
1.7 percent, and the four-quarter change in core PCE prices was 1.4 percent.

Alternative View: An Expectations Trap
&
l
e
v
e Here we present the view that pessimistic expectations about the economic outlook, along with
D downbeat assessments of economic policy, are restraining the pace of economic growth.1 As
n
o long as households’ and firms’ expectations remain mired in a pessimistic and self-fulfilling
c
E “expectations trap,” economic growth will continue to be modest, rather than stepping up
c markedly and almost immediately as in the baseline Tealbook forecast. If the economy is indeed
i
t
s mired in such a trap, a fundamental change in the framework for monetary or fiscal policy might
e
m be required to move the economy to a high-growth equilibrium.
o
D
Households’ expectations about their economic prospects, particularly regarding future increases
in their real incomes, are a fundamental factor determining the pace of consumer spending
growth, and (as shown in the left-hand panel on this page) expectations for real income gains
remain considerably lower than before the recession. These pessimistic expectations could be
reinforced by households’ assessments of whether the government’s economic policies have
been good, which (as indicated in the right-hand panel on this page) have trended down, on
balance, since the end of the recession and are quite low. Consistent with this view, real PCE
growth has averaged only about 2 percent over the past several years despite substantial gains in
aggregate household wealth and steady increases in employment. In contrast to the marked
acceleration in the baseline Tealbook forecast, this modest pace of consumer spending could
persist as long as households’ expectations and assessments of economic policies remain
downbeat.
With firms having seen only modest increases in demand for their output in recent years, some
available measures suggest that companies’ expectations about general economic prospects
have remained subdued. For example, as shown in the left-hand panel on the facing page, the
share of firms in the NFIB survey that think now is a good time to expand their business remains
well below its pre-recession levels. Moreover, as shown in the right-hand panel on the facing
page, a significant fraction of respondents to the survey currently view economic policies—either
regulations or taxes—as the major problem they face. Possibly reflecting these expectations,
and reinforced by these policy assessments, business investment has failed to sustain a material
acceleration in recent years, and slow investment growth could continue.

u
Labor market conditions, while improving, remain disappointing and may be fully consistent with O
pessimistic business and household expectations. The pace of gains in private-sector &
employment has been roughly 200,000 jobs per month over the course of the recovery, but e l
v
businesses continue to have an unusually large fraction of workers with only part-time schedules. e
D
And the marked decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has coincided with a significant
n
decline in the rate of labor force participation. The outsized share of the population currently out o
c
of the labor force—even relative to the effects of demographic trends—could be another E
c
manifestation of both households’ and businesses’ pessimism about the economic outlook. i
t
s
e
Thus, economic activity could well be evolving in a manner more consistent with an m
o
expectations-based model with multiple equilibriums, rather than exhibiting the more D
conventional macroeconomic dynamics governed by movement back to a unique steady-state
equilibrium. Models with multiple equilibriums have had a place in macroeconomics research for
many years.2 In these models, household and business pessimism can be self-fulfilling, with
economic activity persistently mired in a low-expectations trap. In this scenario, economic
growth would be expected to remain stubbornly slower than in the baseline Tealbook projection
and current approaches to monetary policy might prove incapable of generating an acceleration
in economic activity.
Nevertheless, if something were to change that caused expectations to shift considerably—
possibly the result of breakthrough changes in government economic policies—then the pace of
economic activity could rise significantly faster than in the baseline projection as the economy
jumps from a low-growth to a high-growth equilibrium. In this regard, it is interesting to note
that, while not necessarily framing their arguments in terms of jolting the economy from one
equilibrium to another, some observers have argued for a sharp break in the monetary policy
framework.3

An early example of a macroeconomic model with “sunspots” (or “animal spirits,” in Keynes’s words) was
in Costas Azariadis (1981), “Self-Fulfilling Prophecies,” Journal of Economic Theory, vol. 25 (December), pp. 380–
96. A more recent example of this type of model is in Roger Farmer (2013), “Animal Spirits, Persistent
Unemployment, and the Belief Function,” in Roman Frydman and Edmund S. Phelps, eds., Rethinking
Expectations: The Way Forward for Macroeconomics (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press), pp. 251–76.

Has the Fall in Unemployment Overstated the Improvement in Labor Market
&
l Conditions? A View from the Labor Market Conditions Index
e
v
e
D
The unemployment rate has declined nearly 1½ percentage points over the past year. However, partly
n
o because of factors such as the decline in the labor force participation rate and a stubbornly high share
c
E of involuntary part-time workers, many believe that the drop in unemployment has overstated the
c improvement in labor market conditions. Here we use the staff’s labor market conditions index
i
t
s (LMCI), a summary measure of a broad array of labor market data derived from a factor model, to
e
m address this question.1
o
D
First, we compare the baseline LMCI with an alternative that has been computed without the last year
of unemployment rate data. Without the benefit of these data, the model must rely on internal
predictions of the unemployment rate based on the historical relationship of that series with other
labor market indicators. As shown in the panel on the left, increases in the baseline LMCI (the solid
line) have been substantially larger, on average, during the past year than those for the alternative
index (the dashed line) computed without the unemployment rate data.
Next, we examine what the baseline LMCI (including all of its 19 indicators) would have predicted for
the decline in the unemployment rate over the past year; this is shown by the black line in the panel on
the right. Notably, even though the baseline LMCI incorporates the signal from recent unemployment
rate data, the actual unemployment rate (the red line) fell about ½ percentage point more sharply
than the model-based prediction. Thus, unemployment has improved by more than the LMCI can
explain based on its best estimate of improvement in labor market conditions.
1
The LMCI summarizes variation from 19 labor market indicators including those for unemployment and
underemployment, employment, vacancies, workweeks, wages, hiring, layoffs, quits, and survey measures of firms and
workers. For more on the LMCI, see Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick, Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014),

Reserve System, May 22), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/assessing-the-change-in-labor-

v
• We now estimate that energy prices moved up noticeably faster in the second e
D
quarter than projected in the June Tealbook, to an annual rate of 5¼ percent, n
o
c
reflecting both an upside surprise to consumer electricity prices in May and a E
c
i
jump in gasoline prices in the June CPI that we expect to be largely reversed t
s
e
m
in the next couple of months. We expect consumer energy prices to decline
o
D
slightly in the second half of this year and to drift gradually downward in
2015 and 2016, though that downward drift is a little milder than in the June
Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revision to the projected path for crude
oil prices.
• Food prices also have risen more than expected, boosted by drought
conditions in some parts of the country. In 2015 and 2016, food price
increases are projected to slow to a pace just below core as the imprint of
these transitory influences fades.
• Core import prices are estimated to have risen at an annual rate of just
½ percent in the second quarter, somewhat less than expected, reflecting in
part falling prices of imported foods. Going forward, the projection is little
changed from the June Tealbook, with price increases picking up to a
1¼ percent pace in the third quarter and remaining at that pace over the
medium term, consistent with the moderate depreciation of the dollar in our
projection.
• We have revised up the core inflation projection over the medium term by
0.1 percentage point per year in response to the narrower margin of slack. We
project core PCE inflation to average 1.6 percent this year and then to edge up
to 1.7 percent in 2015 and 1.8 percent in 2016. Total PCE inflation is revised
up by a similar amount, but—as before—the projected declines in consumer
energy prices and relatively slow increases in food and beverage prices leave
total PCE inflation a touch below core price inflation in 2015 and 2016.6
6 Over the past 25 years, CPI inflation (on a methodologically consistent basis) has averaged about
0.4 percentage point higher than PCE inflation. The gap varies over time in our projection because

l
e May, boosting our near-term projection. As with price inflation, the narrower
v

n
o as well.7 We now have the employment cost index increasing a little more

than 3 percent, on average, in 2015 and 2016, up ¼ percentage point from the

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
• Beyond 2016, the federal funds rate continues to be set according to the
prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.
• The federal funds rate rises gradually from 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter of
2016 to a little above 4 percent by the end of 2018. The Federal Reserve’s
holdings of securities continue to put downward pressure on longer-term
interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent, and the process of returning the
SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by 2021.
• Real GDP growth slows to 2¼ percent in 2017. The unemployment rate
edges down further in 2017 and is ¾ percentage point below its natural rate at
the end of the year. After 2017, real GDP rises more slowly than our estimate
of potential growth as monetary policy works to offset the tight resource
utilization. The unemployment rate rises gradually back toward its natural
rate.
• With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to rise gradually to the
Committee’s target and the unemployment rate below the natural rate, PCE
price inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2018.
different components of inflation have different weights in the two indexes; for example, the CPI has
relatively large weights for housing services and energy and a relatively low weight for medical services.
The gap is projected to be 0.5 percentage point this year, as a step-up in housing services price inflation has
a relatively large effect on the CPI and low medical price inflation holds down the PCE price index, but
only 0.3 percentage point in 2015 and 2016, as projected declines in energy prices hold down the CPI more
than the PCE price index.
7 Our wage equations are more responsive to movements in slack than are our price equations, so
the tighter slack in this forecast raised projected wage inflation by more than PCE inflation.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign economic activity appears to be climbing out of its first-quarter pothole.
Real GDP growth increased from 2.1 percent in the first quarter to an estimated rate of
2½ percent in the second and is expected to rise to just over 3 percent in the second half
of the year. However, conditions continue to differ widely across countries. Activity
picked up sharply in the second quarter in the emerging market economies (EMEs), as
second-quarter Chinese GDP data showed a substantial rebound and the Mexican
economy appears to have shaken off the torpor of recent quarters. In contrast, growth in
k
o
the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) slowed, as the Japanese economy contracted o
l
t
u
following the April 1 tax increase, although more recent indicators suggest that Japanese O
&
spending has already begun to rebound. Our top-line estimate of second-quarter GDP is
l
e
close to that shown in the June Tealbook, with stronger-than-expected growth in EMEs v
e
D
offset by slower-than-anticipated growth in the AFEs.
n
o
c
E
The projected second-half pickup in foreign GDP growth is linked to ongoing l
’
t
n
fiscal stimulus measures in China, the beneficial effect of stronger U.S. growth on the I
Mexican economy, and a bounceback in Japan. We expect foreign growth to improve a
little more, to 3¼ percent, in 2015 and 2016 amid continued supportive monetary policies
in the AFEs. Firming activity in the advanced economies, including the United States,
also should have positive spillover effects to external demand for EMEs. This projection
is little changed from the previous Tealbook.
We expect a gradual reduction in excess capacity to push inflation up toward AFE
central bank targets over the forecast period, although inflation rates in both the euro area
and Japan are likely to remain below the 2 percent targets through 2016. Differing
outlooks for growth and inflation suggest that the exit from accommodative monetary
policy will vary across the AFEs. We now expect the Bank of England (BOE) to lift off
at the end of this year, a quarter earlier than we had previously assumed. The Bank of
Canada (BOC) is still expected to go next, with a rate hike by the middle of next year.
As in previous forecasts, we do not expect the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank
of Japan (BOJ) to raise rates during the forecast period.
Monetary policy actions continue to vary across EMEs. Central banks in
Colombia and Malaysia have tightened monetary policy since the June FOMC meeting to

contain inflationary pressures. In contrast, Chile cut its discount rate to support growth.
Turkey recently reduced its overnight borrowing rate by 175 basis points, citing the
recent improvement in global liquidity conditions. The recent rate cut partly reverses the
effective increase of 300 basis points that occurred in January when the lira was falling
sharply. Nevertheless, the move came as something of a surprise, given that inflation
remains high.
Several risks to the outlook are worth noting. Financial market volatility has
fallen to a remarkable extent, providing welcome breathing room for some of the more
vulnerable EMEs but at the same time raising concerns that markets may have become
k
o
o complacent. Consequently, once normalization of monetary policy in advanced
l
t
u economies starts in earnest, it may have unusually disruptive spillover effects. EMEs
O
& may also be vulnerable to a financial crisis and economic slowdown in China, a scenario
l
e
v explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section. Another scenario looks at the effect of a
e
D
sharp increase in oil prices should the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine continue to
n
o worsen.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Japan. Household spending data suggest that the April consumption tax hike
contributed to an estimated 5¼ percent decline in real GDP in the second
quarter. Although the drop in GDP now appears to be steeper than previously
expected, it did not fully reverse the first-quarter gain of 6.7 percent, when
spending surged in anticipation of the tax hike. More recent indicators,
including June consumer sentiment and manufacturing PMI, point to a
rebound in economic activity. Factoring in previously announced fiscal
stimulus measures and ongoing monetary easing, we expect GDP growth to
average a little more than 2 percent in the second half of this year before
dropping to less than 1 percent, on average, in 2015 and 2016, partly
reflecting drag from another tax hike. The April tax increase is estimated to
have pushed inflation to an annual rate of 9¼ percent in the second quarter;
inflation excluding the tax hike was likely around 1 percent. We see inflation
just below 1 percent in the second half of the year before picking up to
1½ percent by the end of 2016 along with the slow erosion of excess capacity.
With inflation below target, we still expect the BOJ to step up the pace of
asset purchases somewhat in early 2015.

• Euro area. We estimate that euro-area GDP growth picked up to nearly
1½ percent in the second quarter from 0.8 percent in the first. Recent
indicators are mixed but, on balance, suggest a continuing slow recovery.
Composite PMI and consumer confidence rose, on net, in the second quarter,
and indicators of household spending continued to increase, but industrial
production was down slightly. We expect GDP growth to remain a little
below 1½ percent in the second half of this year before gradually increasing to
nearly 2 percent in 2016 as fiscal drag diminishes, credit conditions ease, and
monetary policy remains accommodative. The projected pace of GDP growth
is sufficient to narrow the output gap from about 4 percent of potential GDP
k
o
currently to 2½ percent at the end of 2016, which should support an increase o
l
t
u
in inflation. Inflation edged up from ¼ percent in the first quarter to O
&
½ percent in the second as energy prices turned up, and it is projected to rise
l
e
to 1½ percent by the end of 2016. We continue to expect the ECB to keep its v
e
D
benchmark policy rate at 0.15 percent through the end of 2016 and to consider
n
o
significant further stimulus through large-scale asset purchases only if risks of c
E
prolonged low inflation appear to increase. ’ l
t
n
I
• United Kingdom. The U.K. recovery remains brisk. Although industrial
production and retail sales dipped in May, this softness followed several
months of solid gains and PMI readings through June show strong
momentum. We forecast GDP to rise 3 percent this year and 2½ percent in
2015 and 2016. June inflation data were higher than expected, pushing our
forecast for inflation in the second half of the year to nearly 2½ percent.
However, the uptick was largely due to temporary factors, and we project
inflation to be around 2 percent in the next two years. Indications by BOE
officials, including Governor Carney’s June 12 Mansion House speech
suggesting that U.K. policy rates could rise sooner than markets expected,
caused us to bring forward our projection of the first BOE rate hike to late
2014. In response to rising house prices and household indebtedness, the
BOE’s Financial Policy Committee made two recommendations: first, that
lenders limit, to a share of 15 percent, their mortgage lending for new
mortgages whose size exceeds 4.5 times the borrower’s income, and secondly,
that lenders assess whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if the
policy rate rose 3 percentage points in the first five years of the loan. The
issuance of these recommendations is consistent with the BOE’s preference
Page 31 of 82

--- Page 35 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) July 23, 2014
for using macroprudential tools rather than monetary policy to manage
financial stability risks.
• Canada. Recent data suggest that GDP growth picked up to 2¼ percent in the
second quarter, after having been held to just 1.2 percent in the first quarter by
severe winter weather and weak U.S. demand. Although monthly GDP data
for April were somewhat disappointing, leading us to mark down our second-
quarter estimate a bit, manufacturing shipments posted a solid gain in May,
and the manufacturing PMI rose further in June. We expect growth to average
around 2½ percent over the forecast period, a touch above its trend pace, as
k
o
Canada’s small output gap closes. Second-quarter inflation, at 3.7 percent,
o
l
t
u was higher than our June estimate. The surprise was partly due to increases in
O
& retail energy prices that we view as temporary, but core inflation also firmed.
l
e As energy prices drop back, inflation is projected to return to near 2 percent
v
e
D over the forecast period. We continue to project that the BOC will begin
n
o raising its target for the overnight interest rate in the second half of 2015.

n EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
I
• China. Recently released GDP data suggest that economic growth in China
rose to 7¾ percent in the second quarter from 5½ percent in the first. The
second-quarter growth rate is 1½ percentage points higher than our previous
forecast. The rebound appears to reflect both a reversal of the first-quarter
plunge in exports as well as a boost to domestic demand from fiscal and
monetary stimulus. Retail sales, which include government purchases,
accelerated during the quarter, partly as a result of the steady stream of
targeted stimulus measures implemented since March. In contrast, fixed-asset
investment growth continued to moderate, led by sharply slowing real estate
investment in a cooling property market. We expect the effects from more
accommodative fiscal and monetary policies to further bolster domestic
spending during the second half, which should also help stabilize the property
sector. As a result, we forecast that economic activity will expand at a
7½ percent pace in the second half of the year before moderating to just above
7 percent in 2016, in line with declining potential growth. Inflation picked up
to a still-subdued 1¾ percent in the second quarter from ¾ percent in the first.
We expect inflation to rise further to about 3 percent as earlier food and fuel
price declines are reversed.

• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that GDP growth in the rest of emerging
Asia improved to a 3½ percent annual pace in the second quarter from
2½ percent in the first. The gain was due primarily to a pickup in the
economies that saw the largest first-quarter slumps in trade. In Hong Kong,
Malaysia, and Taiwan, industrial production and exports reversed earlier
declines, while PMIs improved late in the second quarter. In addition, output
in Thailand appears to have stabilized after a sharp first-quarter contraction
linked to political unrest. In contrast, growth likely moderated in Singapore
and in Korea, where April’s ferry disaster weighed on consumer sentiment.
Improvement in the advanced economies and solid growth in China should
k
o
help growth in the region rise to a trend-like pace of 4¼ percent by next year. o
l
t
u
Inflation is expected to pick up to 3¾ percent toward year-end, largely in O
&
response to mounting food price pressures in India after a dry monsoon
l
e
season, and then settle at 3½ percent over the rest of the forecast period. v

• Latin America. After a prolonged period of weakness, Mexican GDP is o
c
E
estimated to have grown at a 3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, about l
’
t
n
½ percentage point higher than we had projected in June. Manufacturing I
output rebounded, especially in the motor vehicle sector, supported by a
strengthening of U.S. manufacturing and a concurrent increase in exports.
Moreover, indicators point to a recovery in private consumption following a
first-quarter slump related to hikes in tax rates and administered fuel prices.
Construction activity also edged up after having declined since mid-2012. We
project Mexican growth to pick up a little further to 3¾ percent by the end of
2015 and to stay at that rate in 2016. Inflation was boosted to over 5 percent
in the first quarter by the tax increases, but it is expected to drop back to an
average of 3¼ percent over the forecast period.
• GDP growth in Brazil is estimated to have stalled in the second quarter. The
weakness in activity was broadly based: Industrial production, PMIs, and
consumer confidence deteriorated further, while exports expanded only
moderately. Growth is expected to pick up somewhat over the forecast
period, as improving global conditions contribute to higher exports, yet
remain fairly sluggish, averaging a little less than 2½ percent. Inflation
increased to an annual rate of 8¼ percent in the second quarter but is expected
to moderate to 5½ percent by next year, as World Cup pressures on service

prices dissipate and tight monetary policy continues to constrain economic
growth.
• In Argentina, the already gloomy economic outlook is clouded further by
downside risks from a possible default on sovereign debt. The government
faces a July 30 deadline to either pay holdout creditors in full or reach an
agreement with them before servicing its restructured debt. (See the
discussion of foreign developments in the Financial Developments section for
details.)
k
o • Tensions over the situation in Ukraine and Russia have escalated further.
o
l
t Even before the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aircraft last week, the United
u
O
States announced new sanctions against a number of large Russian firms in
&
e l the financial, energy, and defense sectors. In the wake of the airline tragedy, a
v
e
D number of European countries also have indicated that they may adopt
n
additional sanctions. Russia’s stock market declined in response to these
o
c
E developments. Ukraine signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European
l
’
t
n Union on June 24. An IMF team was sent to Ukraine in June to assess the
I
status of the conditions for the second tranche of a $17 billion bailout, and a
decision on the tranche is expected in the next several weeks.

Financial Developments
Financial conditions eased somewhat, on balance, over the intermeeting period,
although geopolitical risks weighed on investor sentiment at times. Investors appeared to
interpret FOMC communications as suggesting that policy would remain highly
accommodative for a substantial time despite an uptick in inflation and incoming data on
labor market conditions that were somewhat stronger than expected.
• Market-based measures of near-term policy expectations edged down.
Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s primary dealer survey continued to
see the first increase in the federal funds rate as most likely coming in the
third quarter of 2015, though the distribution of the expected time moved in
slightly.
• Yields on longer-dated nominal Treasury securities declined over the
intermeeting period, as did similar yields in advanced foreign economies,
continuing the trend observed since the start of the year.
• Amid a solid start to the corporate earnings season, most broad equity price
indexes rose 1 to 2 percent. Risk spreads on high-grade corporate bonds were

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
The implied path of the federal funds rate over the near term, based on a direct
read of financial market quotes, edged down over the intermeeting period.1 Monetary
policy communications were characterized by market participants as signaling a slightly
more accommodative stance than had been expected. Investors were apparently relieved
that the FOMC did not signal a shift toward tighter policy despite strong payroll growth,
the recent uptick in inflation, and some indications of complacency in financial markets.
Market participants also took note of the discussion of monetary policy normalization in
the minutes of the June FOMC meeting and, particularly, the discussion of the likely
spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate.
Consistent with the small moves in the path of the implied federal funds rate over
the intermeeting period, responses to the Desk surveys indicate that market participants’
expectations of the timing of the federal funds liftoff and the subsequent policy path were
largely unchanged from the June survey. Both buy-side and sell-side market participants
continue to see the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the liftoff of the
federal funds rate, although, relative to the June survey, some respondents put somewhat
higher odds on an earlier liftoff date. In apparent response to the discussion in the June
FOMC minutes, the median expected spread between the ON RRP and IOER rates
following liftoff increased from 10 basis points in the June survey to 20 basis points in s

Are Investors Insensitive to Economic News?
One particular concern for monetary policymakers is that market participants
have not been appropriately adjusting their positions in markets in response to
economic developments, perhaps because they anticipate continued monetary
accommodation for a long period of time. Such a view would likely be reflected
in low responsiveness of market interest rates to incoming economic data.
The figure on the facing page shows estimates of time-varying sensitivities of
forward yields on Treasury securities—at near- and longer-term horizons—to
data surprises in nonfarm payrolls (top panel) and a broader set of
macroeconomic indicators (bottom panel). The estimates are calculated by
regressing daily changes in forward rates on the surprise component of the news
releases over one-year rolling samples ending in the period specified on the
x-axis.1
As shown in both panels, none of the measures indicate unusually low levels of
data sensitivity compared with their historical ranges.2 Even so, the sensitivities
of long-term forward rates (the solid blue lines) moved down in late 2013 and
early 2014, consistent with investors coming to view the path of the Federal
Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase program as relatively insensitive to
economic developments following the introduction of the “measured steps”
language in the post-meeting statement last December. The sensitivities of near-
s
n t term forward rates (the dashed black lines) have shown smaller, mixed changes,
e
m on balance, since late 2013.

The surprise component of a release is measured as the difference between the released
indicator and its expectation based on the Action Economics Weekly Survey. For the broader
set of macroeconomic indicators, the estimates from the second step of the following two-
stage procedure are plotted. First, daily changes in forward rates are regressed on release
surprises for 13 economic indicators, scaled by the standard deviations of the surprises, in the
sample spanning the period from January 1, 1990, through July 18, 2014. Then, a linear
combination of economic surprises, weighted by their estimated coefficients, is used as a
regressor in one-year rolling sample regressions to capture time variation in the overall
sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news.
2
The statistical significance of the sensitivities varies over time, but in recent months, the
estimated sensitivities of the forward rates to payroll employment and the aggregate measure
have generally been significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level. We also
considered the sensitivity of the forward rates to CPI releases, but the estimates were rarely
significant.

uncertainty and perhaps also a reduction in investors’ expectations for longer-run growth,
that have been pressuring rates lower since the start of the year.2
Other fixed-income market indicators were about unchanged over the
intermeeting period. Uncertainty about longer-term interest rates implied by swaptions
remained low. TIPS-based five-year inflation compensation was little changed, while
five-year inflation compensation five years ahead edged up. The current-coupon agency
MBS yield decreased 13 basis points, about in line with longer-term Treasury yields.
EQUITY PRICES AND BOND SPREADS
The S&P 500 index rose 2 percent over the intermeeting period, as a solid start to
the earnings season offset some concerns about the geopolitical events. With about
one-fourth of S&P 500 companies having reported, profits in the second quarter appear to
have grown modestly relative to the first quarter, and a slightly higher-than-typical
fraction of firms beat Wall Street estimates for earnings and revenue. Banks have
reported mixed earning results, with the largest banks indicating better-than-expected
results while regional bank results were generally in line with estimates.3 After a
commercial aircraft was shot down in Ukraine, equity market implied volatility as
measured by the VIX rose sharply. However, the VIX subsequently declined and is
unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period at a low level. (See the box

Perspectives on Low Equity Market Volatility
Many broad measures of financial market volatility have fallen in recent months to low levels
not seen in several years. Here, we characterize current levels of equity market volatility from a
longer-term perspective and consider, along a couple of dimensions, what today’s low levels of
volatility might mean for financial market conditions going forward.
Figure 1 shows the realized volatility of daily returns for the S&P 500 equity index back to 1962
and one-month-ahead options-implied volatility for the index back to 1990 (when those
volatilities became available). While the current level of options-implied volatility is very near
the bottom of its historical range, that range is relatively short. Realized volatility, which
implied volatility tends to track quite closely, currently stands at about the 15th percentile of its
longer historical range. An important characteristic of realized volatility is that it has tended to
remain at low levels for protracted periods of time, particularly during economic expansions.
Broadly similar long-term patterns are evident for the realized volatility of returns on long-term
Treasury notes, investment-grade corporate bonds, and foreign exchange rates (not shown).
One question is whether low levels of volatility tend to be associated with adverse outcomes in
financial markets or for the macro economy, perhaps because the low volatility reflects
imprudent risk-taking that eventually leads to elevated losses. Figures 2A and 2B show that
periods of low equity market volatility do not tend to be followed by sharply negative equity
returns or steep increases in volatility, at least not at the one-year horizon. However, moderate
increases in volatility are more likely when current volatility is low. Similar analyses fail to
support the notion that low current volatility tends to predict other adverse events such as
s contractions in real GDP.
t
n
e
m
Of course, this simple analysis does not test whether other factors such as buildups in financial
p
o leverage or risk-taking through other means interact substantially with low volatility to create
l
e
v important vulnerabilities in the financial system that imply elevated risks of adverse events,
e
D perhaps several years in the future.

In particular, the current low interest rate environment has generated a “reach for yield”
motive among some investors, which has been manifested, for instance, in a number of
investment firms across asset classes selling volatility—that is, providing others with insurance
against large moves in asset prices. Such a trading strategy will tend to generate income so
long as volatility remains low. Market participants note that asset managers have been the
main sellers of volatility recently, while the demand for volatility from traditional buyers such as
pension funds, levered funds, and insurance companies has been relatively subdued, reflecting
limited hedging demand in an environment of low volatility.
Consistent with their traditional market-making role, dealers are the primary intermediaries of
volatility-sensitive options and related products in the market. Because of the increased supply
of and subdued demand for volatility products, dealers appear to have increased their holdings
of these instruments. In figure 3, we plot aggregate measures of “vega” and “gamma” for s
t
n
some broker-dealers supervised by the Federal Reserve. These measures capture the dealers’
e
m
profit and loss exposure to increases in the implied volatility of U.S. equities and increases in the
p
size of movements of equity prices, respectively. These measures indicate that dealers would o
l
e
profit from a rise in volatility, and that the downside risks of an increase in volatility may be v
e
concentrated outside of the broker-dealer sector. Of course, we are able to observe these D
l
exposures only imperfectly, and we cannot rule out that broker-dealers might suffer losses as a a
i
c
result of a sudden reversal of volatility, particularly since that event would likely be n
a
accompanied by a downturn in the prices of many risky assets. n

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Long-term yields in advanced economies continued the downward trend observed
since the start of the year, with rising geopolitical tensions—in the Middle East and
Ukraine—constituting an additional factor this intermeeting period. Ten-year sovereign
yields fell substantially in a number of countries, including 20 to 25 basis points in the
United Kingdom and Germany, while two-year yields declined only slightly. Concerns
about one of Portugal’s largest banks and about litigation risks facing European banks
weighed on European markets. Mixed news from emerging market economies (EMEs),
including better-than-expected Chinese growth and concerns about Argentina’s upcoming
scheduled debt payments, generally had modest market effects. The broad trade-
weighted dollar declined about ½ percent over the intermeeting period. Bilateral
exchange rate movements were also generally modest.
Shortly after the close of the June Tealbook, policy expectations for the United
Kingdom moved sharply higher following Governor Carney’s Mansion House speech, in
which he stated that the first increase in policy rates “could happen sooner than markets
currently expect.”4 Market participants now anticipate that the first rate hike will come
in the fourth quarter of 2014, one quarter earlier than just before the speech. In contrast,
expectations for the path of policy rates in the euro area continued to decline, as inflation
readings remained low and as industrial production data in the euro area came in below s
t
n
market expectations. Sweden’s Riksbank, reacting to very low inflation, reduced its e
m
p
policy rate 50 basis points, to 25 basis points, a surprisingly large move, and the central
o
l
e
bank of Norway adopted an easing bias. v
e
D
l
a
In Europe, headline equity price indexes declined over the period, dragged down i
c
n
by a sharp fall in the price of banking-sector shares, which ended the period lower by a
n
i
9 percent in the euro area and 4 percent in the United Kingdom. The drop in banking F
shares was attributed both to fears that additional U.S. litigation against European
financial institutions could be forthcoming after the imposition of record fines on BNP
Paribas and to financial difficulties involving Banco Espírito Santo (BES), one of
Portugal’s largest banks. Earlier this month, BES stock declined precipitously following

missed debt payments and alleged accounting irregularities at BES’s parent firm,
Luxembourg-based holding company Espírito Santo International.
Despite rising geopolitical tensions, most emerging market equity indexes and
bond yields ended the period little changed on net. The United States announced
additional sanctions that place restrictions on U.S. long-term financing to large Russian
banks and energy companies, and that freeze the assets of a number of Russian defense
companies. The sanctions, along with the subsequent downing of a commercial aircraft
in Ukraine, weighed on Russian share prices, which declined 5 percent over the period,
though the ruble was little changed on net.
Developments in the ongoing litigation by holders of Argentina debt who refused
to participate in the country’s most recent restructurings raised the prospect that
Argentina may once again default. By allowing a lower-court ruling to stand, the U.S.
Supreme Court, in effect, ordered Argentina to pay the bondholders who had refused to
accept Argentina’s earlier restructurings before making its regular payment to those who
did participate in the restructurings. These payments must be made by July 30. Market
participants interpreted the ruling as sufficiently broad that it may constrain the ability of
other sovereigns to restructure debt. EME bond yields, however, showed little reaction to
the ruling.

increased financing needs associated with M&A activity. Concurrently, strong issuance
of leveraged loans was supported by continued robust demand from institutional
investors. In particular, issuance of collateralized loan obligations is on pace to reach a
record high this year, with terms and standards in the underlying loans continuing to
weaken. Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was roughly unchanged over the
intermeeting period.
Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) market improved further in
the second quarter. According to the July SLOOS, banks continued to ease their
standards and report stronger demand. In addition, significantly more banks said they
eased their lending standards for CRE loans over the past year than was the case for other
major loan categories. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities in June was
strong, and the number of deals reportedly in the pipeline suggests that issuance will pick
up further in the third quarter.
Financial conditions in the municipal bond market overall were stable despite
volatility in Puerto Rican bond prices after the passage of a law in Puerto Rico that
allowed public corporations to restructure their debt. In response to the legislation, the
credit rating agencies downgraded the bonds of Puerto Rican public corporations by up to
five notches and its general obligation bonds by up to three notches.

Credit card debt outstanding at commercial banks rose in the second quarter at a

credit card loans increased, banks raised credit limits for the fifth consecutive survey, and
a few banks reported that the level of their lending standards for credit card loans had

credit card accounts at the largest bank holding companies suggested an increase over the
past year in the share of new accounts originated to borrowers with lower credit scores.
However, banks reported in the SLOOS that the level of their standards remained tighter
than the midpoint of their longer-term ranges, and, overall, the amount of credit that has
been extended to borrowers with relatively low credit scores is still small.
Credit conditions in mortgage markets were largely unchanged over the
intermeeting period, with mortgage rates holding steady around 4 percent and origination
volumes remaining low. The share of mortgages becoming newly delinquent slowed to
record lows; the share of delinquent mortgages overall continued to decline as well.
According to the SLOOS, a few large banks have reportedly eased their underwriting
standards on prime home-purchase loans over the past year, but, on net, the level of
banks’ standards on all types of residential real estate loans reportedly remained tighter
than the midpoints of their longer-term ranges. Only a few banks indicated in the
SLOOS that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s ability-to-repay and qualified
mortgage rules were reducing approval rates for prime conforming home-purchase
loans.6 In contrast, the approval rates for prime jumbo and nontraditional mortgage loans
were reportedly somewhat lower as a result of the new rules. Respondents pointed to the
increased documentation requirements for assets and income and the 43 percent back-end
debt-to-income ratio requirement for the qualified mortgage status as the most significant
s
reasons for the tightening. t

Participation in the ON RRP exercise jumped to a record high on the June 30
quarter-end. The record take-up reportedly reflected efforts by foreign banking
organizations (FBOs) and other financial intermediaries to limit the size of their balance
sheets on financial reporting dates and, as a result, left money market cash investors in
need of alternative overnight investments such as the ON RRP operation. FBOs, in
particular, have reduced the size of their balance sheets significantly on recent reporting
dates, apparently in response to new regulatory requirements.7
In permanent open market operations, the Federal Reserve purchased $23 billion
in Treasury securities and committed to purchase $34 billion in MBS over the period,
pushing the total size of the balance sheet to $4.4 trillion as of July 21, 2014.8 The
monetary base rose about 11½ percent at annualized rate in June, primarily reflecting the
higher reserve balances resulting from the continued asset purchases.
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury market were largely unchanged over the
intermeeting period, although fails-to-deliver were elevated at times in June, a
development market participants attributed partially to a contraction in dealer balance
sheets leading up to quarter-end. Liquidity conditions in the MBS market remained
stable. The ratio of the Desk’s MBS settlements to gross issuance decreased to
44 percent in June from a high of 95 percent in March. The decline was the result of both
s decreased purchases and a seasonal increase in MBS issuance. These factors likely also

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first
scenario considers the possibility that recent upside surprises in various indicators of
labor market conditions and business confidence are the harbinger of a more rapid take-
up of slack, which leads to a noticeable increase in inflation. By contrast, in the second
scenario, we assume that the first-quarter declines in GDP and GDI are more indicative
of the underlying momentum of the economy than assumed in the baseline. In particular,
weak housing activity as well as adverse feedback between household spending, business
investment, and hiring combine to reduce the pace of the expansion. The third scenario
outlines the effects of a financial crisis in China that has strong spillover effects to other
EMEs and to the United States. In the final scenario, geopolitical tensions intensify,
causing oil prices to rise markedly. Separately, we report our analysis of a scenario in
which risk premiums jump as part of a sudden reversal of current low levels of risk
premiums in bond markets. (See the box “Credit Market Turbulence in Two Models.”)
We generate the first two scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its
effective lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast—by an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using
a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in
the Committee’s recent statements.1 In all cases, we assume that the size and
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.
y
1 Specifically, in the first and second scenarios, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in the t
n
quarter following the observation of an unemployment rate of 5.6 percent, the level of unemployment a i
t
prevailing in the baseline one quarter prior to liftoff. For the last two scenarios, we assume a broadly r
e
c
similar policy rule to the one used in the first two scenarios. One key difference relative to the FRB/US n
U
simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual
&
output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment
s
of wages and prices. k

Credit Market Turbulence in Two Models
As noted in this month’s “QS Assessment of Financial Stability,” investors in
certain asset classes may have become complacent, contributing to low
expected volatility and high asset valuations: Term premiums on Treasury
securities remain modest, and credit spreads on corporate bonds have also
reached low levels. In addition, lending standards in certain market segments
have eased substantially. These situations could reverse quite suddenly. We
explore the effects of such a reversal in two models, FRB/US and a DSGE model.1
We assume that the key effects can be captured in each of the two models by an
increase in interest rate premiums that raise private-sector borrowing costs.
FRB/US and the DSGE model differ in many ways. In the DSGE model, aggregate
spending is considerably more interest sensitive than in FRB/US. In addition, the
risk premium within the DSGE model is a spread of the short-term private
borrowing rate over the federal funds rate, whereas in FRB/US, the risk premium
drives a wedge between longer-term borrowing rates and the expected path of
the federal funds rate. Finally, the DSGE model includes an explicit model of
financial frictions that generates a feedback loop between falling asset values,
rising risk premiums, depressed investment, and even lower asset values. In
FRB/US, the risk premium is also sensitive to economic conditions, but rather
than being based on a structural model, this sensitivity is a function of expected
future output gaps.
The scenario involves an exogenous shock to risk premiums of 90 basis points. In
FRB/US, this shock directly raises a wide spectrum of longer-term private-sector
interest rates, including mortgage and corporate bond rates, as well as the equity
premium. The counterpart in the DSGE model is a jump in the premium on short-
term borrowing (and saving) by firms and households that gradually decays; this
sequence of premiums is chosen to average 90 basis points over 10 years. As a
result, the effect of the shock on long-term interest rates is similar in both
models, but the DSGE model also features a sharp rise in short-term borrowing
rates. In both cases, the premium increase occurs at the end of this year; the
premium then slowly reverts to its normal value thereafter.
The following figures present the effect of this shock in the two models. In the
DSGE model (as shown by the dotted blue lines), the rise in interest rates
depresses consumer spending and leads to a 2 percentage point widening in the
y
t output gap relative to baseline. Inflation falls only a little, both because the

push up firms’ marginal costs. With a weaker economic outlook, liftoff for the
federal funds rate is delayed by a full year relative to the baseline.2
By contrast, the increase in premiums in FRB/US results in a smaller deterioration
of the economy, which delays liftoff by only two quarters. In FRB/US, the output
gap falls by 1 percentage point relative to baseline at the trough.
The much larger drop in output in the DSGE model than in FRB/US occurs
primarily because spending (especially consumer spending) is much more
sensitive to interest rate changes in the DSGE model, as noted earlier. This may
result, in part, from the fact that an increase in risk premiums within the DSGE
model affects all short- and long-term borrowing costs. Indeed, some research
suggests that the effects of increases in borrowing costs that only affect long-
term interest rates have more muted effects on output than the type of risk
premium shock in this DSGE model, but such alternative models remain largely at
the development stage.3

Stronger Activity with Higher Inflation
Some recent data have surprised us on the upside and may indicate that
underlying aggregate demand conditions are stronger than assumed in the baseline. At
the same time, we currently estimate that overall PCE inflation was 2¼ percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter, at the high end of its range in the past few years, and
we also estimate that core PCE inflation registered its highest quarterly readings in more
than two years. In this scenario, we assume that recent labor market improvements boost
the confidence of households and businesses in the durability of the expansion and spark
a virtuous cycle marked by more rapid output growth than in the baseline. We also
assume that, going forward, inflation will be considerably more sensitive to resource
slack than is implicit in the FRB/US model, more in line with estimates in some other
models.
All told, real GDP growth reaches an annual rate of 4½ percent in the second
half of this year and averages 4 percent over 2015; the unemployment rate falls slightly
below 4 percent by the end of 2016. With resource utilization running tighter, inflation
rises notably higher than in the baseline. The federal funds rate lifts off one quarter
earlier and rises more steeply thereafter, moving above 4 percent in 2016 and reaching
above 6 percent in 2018. Nevertheless, inflation rises substantially above target to
3 percent at the end of 2018.2 Thus, in this scenario, the economy moves in fairly short
order from missing on the weak side of both legs of the dual mandate to missing on the
strong side.
Weaker Household Demand
In the staff’s baseline analysis, the first-quarter declines in GDP and GDI are
assumed to reflect, to a large degree, what amounts to statistical noise. In this scenario,
the recent aggregate output readings prove to be more indicative of aggregate demand
going forward than the staff currently assumes. Consumer spending is restrained, and
housing activity does not mount the recovery that is anticipated in the baseline. Instead,
residential investment rises, on average, only 2½ percent per year, in line with longer-run
trend growth. These factors spawn a vicious cycle of lower household spending gains, y
t

reduced output growth, and a slower pace of business investment and hiring. As a result, i

real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 2 percent over the next two years, and the
unemployment rate falls more slowly than in the baseline, edging down only to
5½ percent by the end of 2018. With resource utilization rising much more gradually
than in the baseline, inflation also rises more gradually and the federal funds rate does not
lift off until the fourth quarter of 2017.
China-Driven EME Crisis
Our baseline forecast assumes that output growth in China remains relatively
robust and that the Chinese authorities are able to largely contain China’s growing
financial vulnerabilities. However, a number of developments could possibly trigger a
severe financial crisis, including a bust in the property sector or a run on China’s rapidly
expanding shadow banking system. In this scenario, we assume that China experiences a
financial meltdown that also precipitates financial crises in other major EMEs. (This
scenario was featured in a memo accompanying the July 2014 “QS Assessment of
Financial Stability.”)3
For this exercise, we assume EME borrowing costs soar and the confidence of
EME households and businesses weakens substantially. EME currencies depreciate
against the advanced economy currencies about 20 percent, on average, relative to the
baseline, even though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates in order to
attenuate capital outflows. All told, real GDP in both China and other EMEs declines
7 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2015.
The stress in the EMEs is assumed to have financial spillovers to the rest of the
world. In the United States and other advanced economies, corporate bond spreads rise
and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight-to-safety flows push down
term premiums on government bond yields. In addition, weaker foreign economic
activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports. As a
3 The design of this scenario, including the size and persistence of shocks, is identical to the
“Broader EME Crisis” scenario described in the memo titled “China’s Financial System Risks and
Potential Spillovers to the United States from a Chinese Financial Crisis,” which accompanies the QS
y
report. However, the effects on U.S. GDP and unemployment reported in this scenario, which are based on t
n
the July Tealbook baseline, are noticeably smaller in absolute terms than the effects reported in the memo, a i
t
which were based on the June Tealbook baseline. The smaller effects reflect that monetary policy has more r
e
c
scope to offset adverse shocks, given that the path of the federal funds rate is steeper after liftoff in the July n
U
Tealbook baseline (although the liftoff date remains unchanged); moreover, monetary policy is now
&
assumed to keep the policy rate at its effective lower bound until the unemployment rate falls below

result, U.S. real GDP growth is only 1 percent in 2015 and the unemployment rate hovers
around 6 percent through 2016. With substantially greater resource slack and lower
import prices, U.S. core PCE inflation dips to around ½ percent in 2015. Under these
conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound for almost three
years longer than in the baseline.
Higher Oil Prices
Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia and the West could
intensify in coming months, reducing global oil supplies and causing oil prices to rise
markedly. In this scenario, oil prices increase $30 per barrel above the baseline by the
end of this year before partially receding.4 Higher oil prices dampen consumer spending
and business investment. All told, U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of only
2¾ percent in 2015 and 2016, and the unemployment rate is 5 percent at the end of 2016,
about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline. The higher energy costs cause the
total PCE inflation rate to jump to 4¼ percent in the second half of this year, and put
more persistent—albeit modest—upward pressure on core inflation. The liftoff date of
the effective federal funds rate is delayed one quarter relative to the baseline, and the path
is slightly flatter thereafter.

Note: “Staff” represents Tealbook forecast errors applied to the Tealbook baseline; baselines for FRB/US, BVAR, EDO, and
the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.
