Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

The incoming data on spending and production have been to the soft side of our D
n
expectations. Real GDP now appears to have risen considerably less in the fourth quarter o
c
E
than seemed to have been the case at the time of the January Tealbook, and the available
c
i
t
readings on consumer spending, residential construction, and business investment point e s
m
to less spending growth this quarter than in our previous projection. In addition, factory o
D
output has surprised us to the downside in recent months. We think that unusually severe
winter weather can account for part of the unanticipated weakness, but not the bulk of it.
We have let most of the downside surprise show through to the level of real GDP, but in
the face of real-time indicators that we perceive to be unusually noisy, we have not taken
much signal for the growth of demand going forward. Later this year—once weather-
related fluctuations are expected to have washed out of the data—our updated forecast
has the level of real GDP ½ percent below where we had it in the January Tealbook.
The information from the January and February labor reports was mixed but
generally suggests that the labor market has been improving at a pace similar to what we
anticipated in the January Tealbook. Although payroll gains were lower, on average,
than we had written down in the previous Tealbook, we took only a little signal from
these data because inclement weather appears to have held down payroll growth
noticeably in February and we expect a rebound in March. Meanwhile, the
unemployment rate in both January and February was lower than we had projected.
In light of the combination of yet another downward surprise in the
unemployment rate and weaker-than-expected news on GDP growth, we made a further
adjustment to our supply-side assumptions, reducing the assumed pace of potential output
growth in recent years and carrying forward some of this slower growth into the forecast
period. We lowered potential output growth a little further in 2015 and 2016 to reflect
our revised (but still tentative) estimate of the labor supply implications of the Affordable
Care Act.
Our medium-term forecast for GDP growth is slightly weaker than in the January
Tealbook, reflecting a higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the
downward adjustments we made to our estimates of potential output growth. That said,
the basic contour of the projection is very similar to our previous forecast: We continue

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following
the December 2013 FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the
staff economic projection since the December Tealbook.
Real GDP in the second half of last year is now estimated to have been greater
than the staff expected inthe December Tealbook, while our current forecast for
real GDP growth in 2014 through 2016 is a little below our December projection.
In the background (that is, not visible among the SEP variables), we have
trimmed our assumed rate of growth of potential GDP. The unemployment rate
has declined more than we expected in December; it is now on track to average
6.6 percent inthe first quarter of this year, versus our forecast of 6.9 percent in
the December Tealbook. We continue to project that the unemployment rate
will be around 5% percent at the end of 2016.
The staff projection for both overallandcorePCE inflation is little changed from
our December projection. We continueto project that both core andheadline
inflation will edge gradually higher over the medium term.
The unemployment rate is projected to fall belowtheCommittee's 6.5percent
threshold inthe middle of this year, but we assume thatthe federalfunds rate
will notlift off from its effective lowerbounduntil the second quarter of 2015,
the same as inthe December Tealbook. The trajectory of the federalfunds rate
after liftoffis somewhatsteeperthan in our December projection.

to expect economic activity to expand more quickly over the next few years than in 2013, u
O
reflecting the waning of some of the forces—such as restrictive federal fiscal policy &
l
changes—that have curtailed economic growth in recent years. Our current forecast has e
v
e
real GDP growth stepping up from 2½ percent in 2013 to about 3 percent per year over D
n
the next three years. With growth anticipated to run above potential over the medium o

term, we project the unemployment rate to decline from about 6½ percent in the current
c
i
t
quarter to just a little above 5 percent at the end of 2016, slightly below our assumption s
e
m
for the level of the natural rate at that time. o
D
The data we have received on overall PCE prices since the January Tealbook have
been a bit firmer than we had anticipated, reflecting a January spike in heating costs. We
expect this energy-price bulge to be transitory, and, indeed, energy prices flatten out and
then edge down over the medium term in our projection, causing headline inflation to run
a bit below core inflation. Our forecast for core inflation is essentially the same as in
January, with core PCE inflation expected to rise from about 1¼ percent in 2013 to
1¾ percent in 2016.
In the Risks and Uncertainty section, we provide our views on the degree of
uncertainty attending our projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and
inflation.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are essentially unchanged. We
assume that asset purchases will continue to slow at a measured pace and will conclude
before the end of this year, leaving the cumulative amount of purchases under the
program at about $1.5 trillion.
As in the January Tealbook, we assume the federal funds rate will lift off from its
zero lower bound in the second quarter of 2015. We construe the two-quarter lag from
the assumed end in asset purchases to the liftoff of the federal funds rate to be consistent
with the Committee’s view, expressed in its January statement, that “a highly
accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable
time after the asset purchase program ends.” Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises
at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999)

e
v
e
Other Interest Rates D
n
The projected trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield is slightly lower through o
c
E
the end of 2014, reflecting a decline in term premiums since January, but it is little
c
i
t
revised in 2015 and 2016. Our projection continues to call for a significant rise in s
e
m
Treasury yields, primarily because of the movement of the 10-year valuation window o
D
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well as a gradual waning
of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.
Investment-grade corporate bond and mortgage spreads have changed relatively
little since the January Tealbook. Consequently, our forecasts for corporate bond yields
and mortgage rates in the medium term have been revised essentially in line with our
revisions to the path for the Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
On net since the January Tealbook, equity prices have increased more than we
had projected. We have carried the higher level of prices forward, raising the trajectory
of stock prices this year around 2 percent. However, with our view of fundamentals
unrevised over the medium term, we project stock prices by the end of 2016 to be the
same as in the January Tealbook.
Our forecast for house prices is little changed since January. With the
relationship between prices and rents now more consistent with historical norms, we
continue to expect house price appreciation to slow markedly—from 11 percent in 2013
to an average rate of about 5 percent per year over the next three years—as supply
gradually expands.
Fiscal Policy
Our assumptions for fiscal policy are the same as in the January Tealbook. The
federal debt ceiling was lifted in February as we had anticipated, and, with an agreement
in place for overall spending levels in fiscal year 2015, the degree of uncertainty about
fiscal policy now seems less elevated than in recent years. Despite the expiration of the
EUC program, we continue to expect the drag from fiscal policy to ease this year because
of a diminishing effect of the tax increases put in place last year and a smaller decline in

u real federal purchases. Consolidating across all levels of government, the restraint on
O
& real GDP growth from fiscal policy actions (excluding multiplier effects) is projected to
l
e diminish from about 1 percentage point in 2013 to ½ percentage point this year,
v
e
D ¼ percentage point in 2015, and roughly zero in 2016.
n
o
c
E As in the previous projection, the federal unified budget deficit is anticipated to
c
i
t narrow from 4 percent of GDP in fiscal 2013 to about 2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016,
s
e
m
reflecting ongoing budget consolidation efforts and stronger receipts because of further
o
D
improvements in the economy. As a result, federal debt held by the public is expected to
remain near 70 percent of GDP for the next few years.
Foreign Activity and the Dollar
We estimate that real GDP growth in the foreign economies slowed slightly to an
annual rate of 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, a pace somewhat lower than we
were expecting in the January Tealbook; surprisingly weak growth in Japan and Mexico
more than offset upside surprises in a number of other economies. We expect foreign
output to grow at roughly the same pace in the first half of this year before growth edges
up to a little under 3½ percent in 2016, supported by continued gradual recovery in the
euro area and a return to near-trend growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs).
Relative to the January Tealbook, our outlook for foreign growth is down ½ percentage
point in the first quarter and one-tenth of a percentage point further out, with the revisions
concentrated in the EMEs.
The broad nominal index for the dollar has been about unchanged, on net, since
the January Tealbook. We expect the broad real dollar to depreciate at a 1¼ percent
average annual pace through the forecast period, with all of the depreciation projected to
occur against the currencies of emerging Asia. (See the box “The Path of the Dollar:
Baseline and Alternatives” for a detailed discussion of this forecast.) Relative to the
January Tealbook, we lessened the pace of dollar depreciation in the forecast about
½ percentage point, in part because financial stresses in the euro area have eased to the
point where we no longer expect further improvements to reverse safe-haven flows and
depreciate the dollar. With less of a downward tilt in our forecast, the level of the broad
real dollar is projected to be about 1½ percent higher at the end of the forecast period
relative to the previous Tealbook.

Oil and Other Commodity Prices u
O
The spot price of Brent crude oil is up about $1 per barrel since the time of the &
l
e
previous Tealbook, closing at $109 per barrel on March 11. Despite concerns about v
e
D
Chinese growth, which have depressed industrial metals prices, global oil prices have
n
been supported by forecasts of stronger oil demand in the advanced economies, continued o
c
E
disruptions in Libya, and unrest in South Sudan and Venezuela. Meanwhile, the spot c
i
t
s
price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has risen almost $6 per barrel since the January e
m
Tealbook as improved transportation infrastructure has enabled producers to move o
D
significant amounts of crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, the pricing hub for WTI, to
the U.S. Gulf Coast. Based on futures markets, we project the price of imported oil to
average $99 per barrel in the first half of this year and then to decline gradually over the
remainder of the forecast period, falling below $90 per barrel at the end of 2016. Overall,
this trajectory is about $2 per barrel higher than in the January Tealbook.
Prices for copper and iron ore moved sharply lower amid continued concerns
about Chinese demand prospects. Even so, the broad index of nonfuel commodity prices
that we track has risen about 5 percent since the time of the January Tealbook as prices of
foods and beverages moved higher. In recent weeks, coffee prices soared nearly
75 percent as a severe drought has cut coffee production in Brazil. Tensions in Ukraine
(an important wheat and corn exporter) boosted grain prices, although Ukrainian exports
to date have not been curtailed. We continue to expect nonfuel commodity prices to
increase only slightly over the forecast period.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The information we have received since the January Tealbook has led us to
reduce our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year to 2¼ percent
and our forecast for the current quarter to 1½ percent; both figures are down 1 percentage
point or a little more relative to the January Tealbook. Although it is difficult to
disentangle how much of this unanticipated weakness stems from unfavorable weather
conditions and how much stems from weaker-than-anticipated underlying activity, we
currently estimate that unseasonably adverse weather had little effect last quarter and will
hold down real GDP growth in the current quarter by only about ¼ percentage point.
(The box “Effects of Severe Winter Weather on Economic Activity” presents some of the
detailed empirical examination we undertook to arrive at this conclusion.) In the second
quarter, real GDP growth is projected to be boosted by a rebound in production and sales

The Path of the Dollar: Baseline and Alternatives
&
l
e
v
e A key element of the staff forecast for U.S. activity and inflation is our projection of the foreign
D
exchange value of the dollar. In this box, we provide the rationale for our baseline dollar
n
o projection and discuss plausible alternatives.
c
E
c Our baseline projection has the broad real dollar depreciating 1¼ percent at an annual rate
i
t
s throughout the forecast period, as shown by the black line in the upper-left figure on the
e
m following page. This depreciation is expected to come almost wholly against the currencies of
o
D our emerging Asian trading partners, the red line, with the real value of the dollar against the
currencies of advanced foreign economies (AFEs), the blue line, projected to appreciate slightly,
and the dollar holding roughly flat against the currencies of Latin America (the green line).
The appreciation of the dollar against the AFE currencies reflects our projections of monetary
policy in the United States and the other advanced economies. We assume that market
expectations for the future paths of policy rates in the United States and elsewhere are already
incorporated into the current value of the dollar. However, the staff projects that when the
FOMC begins to raise its target for the federal funds rate the increase will be more rapid than
the markets now anticipate. Therefore, the dollar should appreciate against the AFE currencies
as market views on the path of U.S interest rates eventually adjust to match those of the staff.
Surprises in the path of interest rates are not the dominant force behind our forecast for dollar
depreciation against the emerging Asian currencies. Instead, we believe that a number of
emerging Asian countries have undervalued currencies and a desire to rebalance their
economies toward domestic consumption. Dollar depreciation, then, results from direct policy
choices these countries make to continue to move away from export-led growth. Importantly,
Chinese authorities have indicated an increased commitment to exchange rate flexibility and to
growth led more by private domestic demand. Although in real effective terms, the Chinese
currency has appreciated more than 25 percent since 2007 and the current account surplus has
fallen sharply (the red line in the upper-right figure), we estimate that the cyclically adjusted
current account surplus is still sizable and the Chinese currency is still significantly undervalued,
leaving room for more adjustment. By contrast, in Latin America, where countries are running
current account deficits, on balance (the green line), currencies do not appear to be
undervalued.
The modest depreciation of the broad real dollar results in a U.S. trade deficit that is little
changed as a share of GDP over the forecast period (the black line in the lower-right figure on
the following page). This depreciation is reasonable based on the assumptions of our baseline
forecast, but it is not difficult to imagine alternative scenarios in which the dollar appreciates
over the forecast period.
First, China and other Asian economies may choose to rebalance their economies less quickly
than we envisage. For example, should growth in China threaten to fall below the authorities’
target, policymakers there might be tempted to guide the renminbi lower for a time. Although
the renminbi has depreciated about 1½ percent in nominal terms against the dollar since the last
Tealbook, we view this decline as a temporary interruption of the appreciation trend rather
than a move back to export-led growth. However, given the importance of China for our overall
forecast of dollar depreciation, if we have overestimated the Chinese authorities’ commitment
to rebalancing, it is likely that the value of the dollar will be higher than in our baseline forecast.

Second, the current value of the dollar may not fully price in the effects of future U.S. policy &
normalization. In this case, as U.S. yields rise, the dollar could appreciate more against the AFE e l
v
currencies than we currently anticipate, and could rise against the currencies of emerging e
D
market economies (EMEs) as well. The implications of such a scenario are explored in the
n
“Stronger Dollar” alternative simulation in the Risks and Uncertainty section. As shown by the o
c
blue line in the lower-left figure, in this scenario, the broad real dollar appreciates somewhat E
c
over the forecast period, instead of depreciating as in the baseline. This appreciation weighs on i
t
s
the U.S. trade balance, as shown by the blue line in the lower-right figure, and, as described in e
m
the Risks and Uncertainty section, contributes to a modest decline in U.S. output relative to
o
baseline. D
Third, in our baseline, we do not expect any major or persistent disruptions to global financial
markets, although bouts of volatility could recur, such as the financial tension we observed
recently in some vulnerable EMEs. However, stresses in the vulnerable economies could erupt
into a full-fledged EME crisis, a scenario presented in previous Tealbooks and also discussed in
the Risks and Uncertainty section. In this case, we expect flight-to-safety flows to push up the
dollar substantially, as shown by the red line in the lower-left figure, and the trade balance (the
red line in the lower-right figure) deteriorates more markedly, contributing to sharper declines
in U.S. output relative to baseline (not shown).

Effects of Severe Winter Weather on Economic Activity
&
l
e
v
e According to many reports, economic activity was slowed by the unusually snowy and cold
D
weather this winter. To gauge the significance of these reports for January and February, we
n
o statistically analyzed the effect of winter weather on four economic indicators: single-family
c
E housing starts, private payroll employment, real PCE-relevant retail sales, and light vehicle
c
i sales.1 Specifically, we looked to see whether unusually cold or snowy weather since the
t
s
e 1996–97 winter season resulted in a deviation of each economic indicator from its concurrent
m
o trend (defined as a centered five-month moving average). This analysis informed our
D
assessment in the baseline forecast of the extent of weather effects.
To construct indexes of adverse weather, we developed daily county-level measures of
atypically heavy snowfalls and cold temperatures from weather-station data provided by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We then derived daily aggregate indexes
for extreme weather events by weighting these weather measures with county-level
employment for selected industries from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns series.
The industries chosen were tailored to each economic indicator (for example, in our housing
starts analysis, county-level construction employment was used to aggregate the county-by-
county weather indexes).
We created these highly granular indexes (rather than employing conventional monthly
national-level series) based on two considerations. First, what constitutes bad weather is
local: Three inches of snow probably has a greater effect on economic activity in Athens,
Georgia, than in Athens, Ohio. Thus, we looked at deviations in temperature or snowfall from
historical norms for each county. Second, compared with a late-month weather event, the
effect of an early-month event is more likely to be reversed before the month ends because
weather effects, particularly for snow, are short lived. For example, weekly chain store sales
appear to be negatively correlated with contemporaneous snowfall but positively correlated
with the previous week’s snowfall—purchases are only delayed temporarily. Similarly, the
lowest readings this winter for many weekly indicators of industrial production occurred
during the coldest weeks.
The table on the next page reports the results using our preferred weather indexes for each
indicator. The middle two columns show the number of months in our 1997–2013 sample that
were either snowier or colder than normal by at least one standard deviation, along with the
number of corresponding months this winter. The next column shows the percentage of the
cold or snowy months in our sample that had economic indicators below trend. The final
column shows the average deviation from trend for the economic indicators in those months.
Single-family housing starts often appeared to be suppressed by extreme cold or snow:
Eighty-two percent of the months in our sample with heavy snows saw single-family housing

Real PCE-relevant retail sales comprise the portion of total retail sales used by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis in estimating PCE.
Industrial production was also affected by severe winter weather in January; see the discussion in the
Technical Q&A for the G.17 release at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/g17_technical_qa.htm.

starts dip below their recent trend, and the mean reduction from the trend level of starts O
during those unusually snowy months was 1.3 percent. Heavy snows late in a month were &
l
more likely to be associated with a weak reading than those early in a month. Housing starts e
v
e
sagged in every extremely cold month, but the effect of the cold seemed unrelated to when it D
occurred within the month. A rough estimate from this analysis suggests that single-family n
o
housing starts were curbed by an annual rate of 25,000 units in January this year and c
E
17,000 units in February.2 c
i
t
s
e
Employment tended to be held down only a little when the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey m
o
week was unusually snowy or cold.3 The snowy survey week in February suggests a reduction D
of around 30,000 jobs in that month—with a large portion of that restraint attributable to
lower construction employment—but the reading for January seems likely to have been
affected much less.
Real PCE-relevant retail sales appeared to be suppressed by severe winter weather regardless
of its timing during the month. (Similarly, very warm or snowless weather usually led to
above-trend consumer sales.) Based on weighting county-level weather indexes by retail
employment, January and February of this year were both colder and snowier than normal,
with the cold being more extreme. This analysis suggests that the levels of these retail sales in
January and February were held down about ¼ percent each month.
Light vehicle sales seemed more affected by heavy snowfall than by cold. Using weights
based on employment at auto dealers, neither January nor February were especially cold, but
snowfall was relatively high; sales appeared to have been depressed by an annual rate of
roughly 280,000 units in January and 360,000 units in February.

The point estimates of the winter effects for all of the indicators are drawn from regressions of the
indicators’ deviations from trend on the cold and snow indexes in just the severe weather months.

However, the effect of snow or cold during the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey week on the average
workweek, and thus on aggregate hours for the month, is appreciably larger.

E
Real PCE is now estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the
c
i
t
fourth quarter of last year, 1½ percentage points less than our projection in the January s
e
m
Tealbook. This updated estimate, which incorporated an unusually large downward o
D
revision to retail sales in November and December, puts consumer outlays on a lower
trajectory going into this year. In addition, retail sales fell sharply in January, and light
motor vehicle sales through February have been weaker than we had expected; that said,
the BEA’s initial estimates of health-care-services consumption rose more in January
with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act than we had expected. On balance, we
now project that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the current quarter,
down ½ percentage point from the previous Tealbook. We think that weather had little
effect on real PCE last quarter; however, on the view that adverse weather accounts for a
portion of the unexpected softness in outlays this quarter, we project that real PCE
growth will move up to 3¾ percent in the second quarter as the weather returns to
seasonal norms. As before, we estimate that the projected increase in spending in the
first half would be larger if not for the termination of the EUC program.
The incoming data on housing activity have also been softer than we were
anticipating. Both single-family and multifamily housing starts tumbled in January, with
the weather likely playing a role. However, permits, which tend to be less sensitive to
weather influences and a better indicator of the underlying trajectory of activity, also
moved down in January and have shown essentially no sign of sustained improvement
since last spring. Although we expect a weather-related bounceback in housing activity
in coming months, we read the recent data as pointing to a flatter underlying trajectory
than we had projected last round. As a result, we now forecast real residential investment
to increase at an annual rate of about 6½ percent over the first half of this year, a
downward revision of 2 percentage points from our previous forecast.
Business Investment
We estimate that real private investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I)
increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. However, orders and shipments of
nondefense capital goods point to a deceleration in business equipment outlays early this

year. Some of the spending slowdown may be due to the expiration of bonus u
O
depreciation tax provisions at the end of last year, which we had long since built into our &
l
forecast. In addition, some of the weakness in January shipments likely reflected severe e
v
e
weather. We anticipate that the weather-related weakness will be made up in February D
n
and March and project that business purchases of capital goods will rebound in the o
c
E
second quarter, consistent with the generally positive readings from surveys of business
c
i
t
sentiment and rising earnings expectations. On balance, real outlays for E&I are now s
e
m
projected to increase at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the first half of this year, a little o
D
softer than in the previous Tealbook.
Real investment in nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining edged
down in late 2013, as high vacancy rates and tight financing conditions for new
construction continued to restrain activity in this sector. Incoming spending data point to
another decline in outlays on new buildings early this year. Meanwhile, real investment
in drilling and mining structures is projected to post a sizable gain over the first half of
this year, supported by high oil prices and new drilling technologies.
We revised up our projection for nonfarm inventory investment in the current
quarter, as it seems likely that some producers were left with higher stocks in the wake of
widespread downward surprises to final sales. However, these adjustments were
relatively small, and, more broadly, inventory-to-sales ratios from book-value data and
the staff’s flow-of-goods system, as well as gauges of inventory sentiment from regional
and national manufacturing surveys, do not point to significant inventory imbalances in
most industries. One exception to this pattern is motor vehicles, where days’ supply in
January and February was well above the automakers’ target.
Government
After falling sharply in the fourth quarter, real federal purchases are projected to
rise at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the first quarter, reflecting a reversal of the effects
of the temporary government shutdown in October. We expect federal purchases to fall
3 percent in the second quarter, as spending resumes its trend rate of decline.
We project that real state and local government purchases will edge up over the
first half of this year. Although incoming data point to a further decline in public-sector
construction spending this quarter, we attribute some of the weakness to unseasonably
adverse weather and expect it to be reversed in the second quarter. Meanwhile,

Foreign Trade D
n
After surging 9½ percent at an annual rate in the final quarter of 2013, real o
c
E
exports of goods and services are expected to be about flat in the current quarter,
c
i
t
consistent with the softness of the January trade data. For the second quarter, we project s
e
m
that exports will rise 3¼ percent, a pace more in line with foreign growth. Meanwhile, o
D
real imports of goods and services are expected to rise 1½ percent in the first half of the
year, held back by a net decline in oil imports and the slow pace of U.S. GDP growth.
All told, the external sector is projected to subtract ¼ percentage point from real GDP
growth in the current quarter and then to make a positive ¼ percentage point contribution
in the second quarter. On average, this contribution is about the same as in the January
Tealbook.
The Industrial Sector
After rising at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter, manufacturing
output is projected to be little changed this quarter, held down in part by disruptions from
the severe winter weather. With most of the new orders indexes from the latest
manufacturing surveys at generally favorable levels and some catch-up anticipated for the
weather-related losses in output this quarter, we expect the growth of manufacturing
output to step up to about 4 percent in the second quarter. Even so, the projected average
rate of increase over the first half of this year is 1½ percentage points below our forecast
in the January Tealbook.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We revised down slightly our forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term
in light of the drag from the higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and
the downward adjustments we made to our estimates of potential output growth. We now
forecast real GDP growth to edge up from 2½ percent in 2013 to 3 percent, on average,
over the next three years. These changes leave the output gap unrevised at the end of
2016 and the level of real GDP about ¾ percent lower than in the January Tealbook.
Our projection that real GDP growth will step up over the medium term—even as
interest rates rise—reflects our expectation that some of the forces that have been holding
back growth in recent years will recede. In particular, the restraint from changes in

federal fiscal policy is waning and should continue to do so, and we think that mortgage u
O
credit will gradually become more broadly available. These developments are expected &
l
to foster a growing sense among households and firms that the downside risks to the e
v
e
recovery have diminished; in turn, the improvement in confidence should provide D
n
additional support to consumer spending, business investment, and hiring. o
c
E
c
i
These influences are most apparent in our projection for consumer spending. In t
s
e
m
particular, we continue to anticipate that the fading effects of last year’s tax increases,
o
D
gains in household wealth produced by rising house and equity prices, and improved
consumer confidence will lead real PCE growth to move up to 3½ percent this year and
3¾ percent in 2015 before slowing to about 3 percent in 2016. This forecast is about
¼ percentage point per year lower than in the January Tealbook, largely due to the slower
growth in potential output (and hence in permanent income) in this projection.
Rising income and confidence also are expected to lead to a higher pace of
household formation and thereby boost residential construction. However, the effect on
homebuilding will likely be damped by rising mortgage rates and—at least for some
time—the limited availability of buildable lots and other specialized inputs. We expect
the growth in residential investment to increase at an annual rate of roughly 15 percent in
the second half of 2014 and in 2015 before slowing to 10 percent in 2016.
Real outlays for E&I are expected to rise 5 percent per year, on average, over the
next three years. Although faster than the pace of growth posted in 2013, our medium-
term projection for E&I growth is modest by historical standards and reflects our
expectation that business output will increase at only a moderate pace over this period.
Similarly, we continue to expect only subdued growth in spending on nonresidential
structures over the medium term.
The external sector is expected to deduct slightly from the growth of real GDP
this year and next and then to be about neutral for growth in 2016. We expect real
exports to pick up over the forecast period, supported by firming foreign growth and
dollar depreciation. But we also project real imports to increase at a solid pace, as the
boost from U.S. growth more than offsets the drag from both the depreciating dollar and
a continued trend decline in oil imports.
Federal government spending is projected to continue to trend down over the
forecast period, restrained by ongoing fiscal consolidation and reductions in spending on

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION D
n
o
Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook for the Labor Market c
E
c
The latest readings on the labor market, notably the January and February jobs i
t
s
e
reports, suggest that the labor market has been improving at a pace similar to what we m
o
anticipated in the January Tealbook.1 Total nonfarm payrolls rose at an average pace of D
150,000 in January and February, about 20,000 less per month than we had expected.
However, we think that adverse weather conditions held down payroll employment in
recent months. In addition, we think that weather accounted for much of the recent
decline in the workweek, which fell to 34.2 hours in February from an already low level
in December and January.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in February,
¼ percentage point below its fourth-quarter average and 0.1 percentage point lower than
we had projected in the previous Tealbook. The labor force participation rate moved up
0.2 percentage point over the same period, to 63.0 percent, in contrast to our January
projection of no change. Other measures of labor utilization were generally upbeat in the
past two months as well. We think the key measures from the household survey were
probably little affected by weather-related disruptions.
Looking ahead, we expect nonfarm payrolls to increase 230,000 in March, a
figure that includes a 50,000 weather-related bounceback. In the second quarter, we
expect payroll gains to average 210,000 per month. We have carried forward the lower
level of the unemployment rate and now project it to edge down to 6.6 percent in March
and 6.5 percent in the second quarter. Similarly, we have adjusted up the path of the
labor force participation rate and expect that it will remain at its current level of
63.0 percent in coming months.
1 The January report incorporated the annual benchmark revisions, which raised the level of
payroll employment in December 2013 by about 500,000. Of this amount, about 350,000 was the direct
effect of the March 2013 benchmarking, which was more than accounted for by the expansion of the
payroll survey’s scope to include an additional industry that provides home-based social services for the
elderly and disabled. The remainder reflected an upward revision to the estimated pace of payroll gains
since last March, some of which may have been due to the expanded scope.

Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment u
O
The downward surprise in the unemployment rate so far this year was &
l
e
accompanied by disappointing news about the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of v
e
D
2013 and the first quarter of this year. To help reconcile these apparently divergent
n
signals for resource utilization, we marked down our assumptions for potential output o
c
E
growth from 2011 to 2013 by 0.1 percentage point per year, which reduced the level of c
i
t
s
potential output about ¼ percent at the end of 2013, similar to the downward revision to e
m
the level of real GDP in that quarter. In addition, we carried forward some of the weaker o
D
potential output growth in recent years into the forecast period. Finally, for this
Tealbook, we reassessed the labor supply implications of the Affordable Care Act, which
led us to lower potential output growth in 2015 and 2016 slightly further.
Based on our revised assumptions, we now expect potential output growth to
increase from 1½ percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 2014 and about 2 percent in 2015 and
2016, leaving the level of potential output ¾ percent lower at the end of 2016 than in the
January Tealbook. We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will
edge down from 5½ percent in 2013 to 5¼ percent in 2015 and 2016.
The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market
Total payroll employment is projected to increase 210,000 per month in 2014 and
then rise 220,000 per month, on average, in 2015 and 2016. This trajectory is slightly
lower than in the January Tealbook, in line with the slower projected rate of output
growth over the medium term.
Starting from its slightly lower level of 6.6 percent in the current quarter, the
unemployment rate is projected to edge down to 6¼ percent at the end of the year, the
same level as in the January Tealbook. Thereafter, the projected path is unrevised, with
the unemployment rate falling about ½ percentage point per year to just above 5 percent
at the end of 2016. The projected level of the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 is
slightly below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.
Resource Utilization
We estimate the unemployment rate is about 1¼ percentage points above our
estimate of the natural rate in the first quarter, and we put the GDP gap at about

The Outlook for Prices and Compensation
o
D
After rising at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, total PCE prices
are projected to increase at a 1½ percent pace in the first quarter, reflecting a weather-
induced jump in energy prices. Core PCE inflation was 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter
and appears to be running at a similar rate in this quarter, in line with our previous
forecast. We project that by midyear, both total and core PCE inflation will be about
1½ percent, the same as in the January Tealbook.
We have marked up our near-term projection for consumer energy price inflation.
In January, consumer prices for heating fuel, natural gas, and electricity came in much
higher than we predicted in the January Tealbook, likely reflecting the effect of cold
weather on heating demand. Indeed, the path of futures prices for natural gas over the
next year has moved up sharply since the time of the January Tealbook, as inventories
have fallen to their lowest levels in more than a decade. As a result, overall consumer
energy prices are now projected to rise at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the current
quarter and to hold at that higher level in the second quarter, rather than edging down
over the first half as we had anticipated in the previous Tealbook. Given the downward
tilt in our medium-term forecasts for crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to
project that PCE energy prices will decline modestly beyond the near term.
Consumer food prices are projected to increase at a moderate pace over the first
half of this year after being about unchanged in the fourth quarter. This projected pickup
in food price inflation reflects the pass-through of recent increases in farm commodity
prices following their sizable declines last year, as well as the effect of drought
conditions in California on prices of fruits and vegetables. We continue to project that
2 We assume that the natural rate is on a downward trajectory, reflecting some unwinding of the
effects of the recession. We put it at 5.4 percent at present and anticipate that it will decline to 5.2 percent
in the medium term.

PCE food prices will increase at a pace that is slightly below core inflation over the u
O
medium term. &
l
e
v
Since the January Tealbook, core PCE inflation was revised up slightly in the e
D
fourth quarter to 1¼ percent, with the changes concentrated in the nonmarket component. n
o
c
However, the core inflation reading in January was close to what we were expecting, and E
c
i
we continue to predict that core inflation will be about 1¼ percent in the current quarter, t
s
e
m
will edge up to 1½ percent in the second quarter, and will remain there over the second
o
D
half of the year.
Much of the projected pickup in core PCE inflation this year reflects a projected
acceleration in import prices. After falling throughout most of last year, prices of
imported core goods are expected to increase at an annual rate of ¾ percent in the first
half of this year and then to step up to a 1½ percent pace in the second half, as the
restraining effect of previous dollar appreciation fades. Core import prices are projected
to continue to rise just under 1½ percent per year in 2015 and 2016, a pace that is in line
with a modest projected increase in commodity prices and our assumed pace of dollar
depreciation. We estimate that import prices will continue to have a slightly restraining
effect on U.S. consumer price inflation over the medium term, albeit noticeably less than
in the past two years.
Readings on longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The final
February reading on median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Michigan
survey stood at 2.9 percent, well within the relatively narrow range seen in recent years.
Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by the Survey of
Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2 percent in the first quarter. TIPS-based
measures of longer-term inflation compensation are just slightly lower than at the time of
the January Tealbook.
With stable long-run inflation expectations, a projected pickup in import prices,
and gradually diminishing margins of slack, we expect core PCE inflation to increase
from 1¼ percent in 2013 to 1½ percent this year and 1¾ percent in 2016; this forecast is
essentially the same as in the January Tealbook. Given the slight downward trajectory
for energy prices, total PCE inflation is projected to be a bit below core inflation over
most of the medium term. Thus, through 2016, total PCE inflation is projected to remain
below the Committee’s long-run objective of 2 percent.

The incoming data suggest that labor compensation has continued to rise at a u
O
modest pace. We now estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business &
l
sector will increase at a 2½ percent annual rate in the current quarter—close to its e
v
e
average seen over the previous two years. We expect the gradual tightening of the labor D
n
market over the medium term to push hourly compensation growth up to 3½ percent by o
c
E
2016. The employment cost index has provided a less volatile measure of compensation
c
i

pressures in recent years. In 2013, it increased 2 percent; over the next few years, as s

labor markets tighten, we expect this index to accelerate to about a 3¼ percent pace. o
D
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the FRB/US
model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and
other factors. The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key
assumptions:
• The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.
• The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent. The
process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be
completed by 2021.
• Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds continue to decrease, on
balance, toward their longer-run normal levels, and financial institutions
further ease their lending standards.
• The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) is 3½ percent of GDP
in 2017 and widens thereafter, primarily reflecting fast-rising transfer
payments for retirement and health-care programs. The ratio of federal debt
to GDP remains at about 70 percent in 2017 but edges up thereafter.
• The real foreign exchange value of the dollar stays constant from 2017
onward. The price of crude oil holds steady in real terms. Foreign real GDP
rises at an annual rate of about 3 percent from 2017 to 2020.
• The natural rate of unemployment is 5¼ percent, and potential GDP rises
around 2¼ percent per year from 2017 to 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign real GDP growth edged down to a 2¾ percent pace in the fourth quarter
of 2013. This outcome was somewhat weaker than we projected in January, as growth in
Japan and Mexico was much lower than we had anticipated, overwhelming upside
surprises in many other economies. We expect foreign growth in the first half of this
year to continue at a similar rate and then to move up to almost 3½ percent by 2016.
Much of this pickup in growth comes from a strengthening of the recovery in the euro
area and a firming of conditions in emerging markets, especially in Latin America, after
k
o
particularly poor performance last year. o
l
t
u
O
The trajectory of foreign economic growth is somewhat lower than we wrote &
l
down in the previous Tealbook, particularly in the current quarter, owing to severe winter e
v
e
weather in Canada and relatively subdued recent indicators in EMEs. The rest of the D
n
forecast also has been revised down a bit. This revision is partly in response to the o
c
E
slightly weaker path for U.S. growth, but it owes more importantly to our reassessment of l
’
t
n
the underlying strength of economic activity in a number of countries. We now see I
China’s economy decelerating a touch faster over the next few years than we previously
assumed, which will weigh on other EMEs, particularly in emerging Asia, and we are
somewhat more pessimistic about prospects in Latin America as well.
Although we believe that foreign growth will pick up over the forecast, we are
attentive to several risks to our outlook. The financial stresses that intensified in many
EMEs around the time of the January FOMC meeting have eased, but these could well
return, perhaps as monetary policy in the advanced economies normalizes. A possible
scenario along these lines is discussed in the “Stronger Dollar” simulation in the Risks
and Uncertainty (R&U) section of the Tealbook. In the extreme, such stresses could
snowball into a broad-based EME crisis, which is also discussed in R&U. Finally, we are
watching recent developments in Ukraine carefully. Although the response of global
financial markets to the Ukrainian crisis has been minimal, were this crisis to intensify, it
could have deeper effects on global markets and growth.
Foreign inflation is estimated to have fallen slightly in the current quarter, as a
welcome rise in inflation in the advanced foreign economies was more than offset by an
equally welcome decline in some EMEs. The rise in AFE inflation has been concentrated
Page 35 of 96

--- Page 39 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
in the euro area and Canada, where inflation had fallen to very low levels late last year.
Although the risk of AFE deflation has receded somewhat, substantial resource slack and
below-target inflation will keep monetary policy in the AFEs highly accommodative for
some time. Meanwhile, a number of the more vulnerable EMEs continued to tighten
monetary policy during the intermeeting period, and financial stress in some of these
economies appears to have become less acute in recent weeks.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
Real GDP growth in the AFEs remained near a 2 percent pace in the fourth
k
o quarter of 2013. Economic activity expanded for the third consecutive quarter in the euro
o
l
t area, and growth was particularly solid in Canada and the United Kingdom. In contrast,
u
O
the pace of activity in Japan failed to pick up from its modest third-quarter rate. We see
&
e l AFE growth continuing at about 2 percent in the first quarter, before dipping to
v
e
D 1¾ percent in the second quarter as Japanese output contracts in response to a
n
consumption tax hike. Thereafter, as the Japanese economy resumes growth and the
o
c
E recovery in the euro area continues to firm, AFE growth moves back up, averaging
l
’
t
n 2¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, somewhat above our estimate of
I
potential growth. Relative to the January Tealbook, our outlook for the AFEs is down a
touch, largely reflecting the markdowns to U.S. and EME growth.
Recent data suggest that quarterly inflation in the AFEs will pick up to 1¼ percent
in the first quarter from 0.7 percent at the end of 2013. With output gaps projected to
narrow and inflation expectations relatively well anchored, AFE inflation should rise to
1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, still a bit below the 2 percent targets in most
of these economies. Given our outlook of moderate growth and subdued inflation, we
expect monetary policy in the major AFEs to remain highly accommodative through
2016. That said, we do have policy rates moving up in all of the major advanced
economies by the end of 2016 as slack is substantially eroded.
Japan
Japanese real GDP rose just 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, 3 percentage points
less than estimated in the previous Tealbook. Much of the surprise reflected a large
negative contribution from the external sector, as imports rose sharply, while export
growth was muted. In addition, household spending picked up less than we had thought
given our expectation that purchases will be pulled forward ahead of April’s consumption
tax hike. Our sense is that the fourth-quarter weakness will prove transitory, as a surge in
Page 36 of 96

--- Page 40 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
industrial production in January, as well as relatively strong car registrations and elevated
PMI readings through February, point to a substantial strengthening of activity. Despite
the recent weakness of exports, we continue to expect that last year’s large yen
depreciation will provide a noticeable boost to external demand this year. Accordingly,
we project that real GDP will expand 4¼ percent in the first quarter before contracting
3¾ percent in the next as the consumption tax rate jumps from 5 percent to 8 percent.
Thereafter, growth should rebound to a 2 percent pace in the second half of the year,
partly boosted by fiscal stimulus measures, and average 1¼ percent over the remainder of
the forecast period.
k
Quarterly inflation was 2 percent (annual rate) at the end of 2013 but should fall o
o
l
t
back to 1 percent in the current quarter, as energy and food prices stabilize after being u
O
elevated by the pass-through of previous yen depreciation. Excluding the direct effect of &
l
two planned tax hikes, we see inflation remaining near 1 percent in 2014 and then rising e
v
e
to 1¾ percent by late 2016 as additional monetary easing promotes a further narrowing of D
n
the output gap and an increase in inflation expectations. Indeed, we continue to assume o
c
E
that the Bank of Japan will extend and expand its asset purchase program next quarter as l
’
t
n
it aims to raise inflation to 2 percent. I
Euro Area
Euro-area GDP expanded 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, with activity
strengthening in both core and peripheral economies. Recent data, including a pickup in
retail sales in January, and further gains in the composite PMI and economic sentiment
through February, suggest that the pace of expansion is firming. In addition, bank
lending standards for mortgages in the fourth quarter eased for the first time since 2007.
All told, we revised up slightly our projection for euro-area growth in the near term. We
now think that GDP growth will average 1¼ percent in the first half of this year before
rising to 2 percent in 2016. This projection reflects a gradual pickup in domestic demand
as fiscal consolidation diminishes, financial and credit conditions normalize, and
monetary policy remains accommodative. It also assumes that European authorities will
make continued progress with fiscal and structural reforms, including the review of the
banking system and establishment of a single European supervisor.
Data through February suggest that inflation will rise to a ¾ percent annual rate
this quarter from 0.1 percent in the previous quarter, as a further decline in retail energy
prices is more than offset by a firming of core prices. The recovery in output and
Page 37 of 96

--- Page 41 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
stabilization of energy prices should gradually push inflation to 1½ percent by the end of
2016. Amid signs of improvement in inflation and activity, the European Central Bank
(ECB) left its benchmark policy rate at 0.25 percent in March, reiterating its readiness to
act if conditions deteriorated. We continue to expect the ECB to raise its main policy rate
in the first half of 2016.
United Kingdom
The final release of national accounts data confirmed that the U.K. economy
expanded at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, similar to
the average pace for the first three quarters and up sharply from a stagnant 2012. Last
k
o
o year’s acceleration in growth was accompanied by a surprisingly strong performance of
l
t
u
O the labor market, with the unemployment rate falling from 7.8 percent in mid-2013 to
&
7.2 percent in the fourth quarter. In addition, investment picked up noticeably during the
l
e
v course of 2013. Given the momentum in investment, and taking into account robust
e
D
PMIs in recent months, we believe output growth will remain at a solid 3 percent in 2014
n
o
c before easing back to 2½ percent in 2015 and 2016.
E
l
’
t
n
I Consumer prices fell slightly in January, leading us to lower our forecast of
current-quarter inflation to 1¼ percent. Thereafter, with the output gap projected to
close, inflation should gradually pick up to nearly 2 percent over the remainder of the
forecast period. On February 12, the Bank of England updated its guidance on monetary
policy following a decline in the unemployment rate to near its previously announced
threshold of 7 percent, as discussed in the box “The Bank of England’s Next Phase of
Forward Guidance.” The guidance was consistent with our prior expectation of a rate
hike in early 2015, followed by gradual increases thereafter.
Canada
Canadian real GDP rose 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, ¾ percentage point
more than estimated in the January Tealbook, driven by solid gains in consumption and
exports. However, data through February show that employment growth slowed sharply
and that the manufacturing PMI fell well below its fourth-quarter level. We judge that
these readings owe their weakness largely to severe winter weather in Canada and lower
growth in the United States, and we have first-quarter growth slowing to 1¾ percent,
¾ percentage point less than in the January Tealbook. Looking ahead, we expect real
GDP growth to bounce back to 3 percent in the second quarter, before settling near
2½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period. This outlook is down a touch since
Page 38 of 96

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
the previous Tealbook, reflecting a downbeat annual survey of Canadian investment
intentions and the more moderate path for U.S. growth.
In January, core inflation firmed and headline inflation rose to 1.5 percent on a
12-month basis, from 1.3 percent in December. Accounting for recent currency
depreciation and higher projected energy prices, we now expect consumer prices to rise at
an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of this year, up from 0.5 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2013. Inflation should then moderate to 1½ percent in the second half of 2014
before slowly edging back up to 2 percent by late 2016 as the output gap is eliminated.
Against the backdrop of slightly slower growth and still-moderate inflation, we expect
k
the Bank of Canada to keep its policy rate at 1 percent until the third quarter of 2015, one o
o
l
t
quarter longer than in the previous Tealbook. u

and much of emerging Asia. Recent indicators suggest that EME growth will remain at a
3½ percent pace in the current quarter before strengthening to a near-trend pace of
4½ percent by next year. This pickup is concentrated in Latin America. In particular, we
expect the Mexican economy, which has a large weight in U.S. trade, to exit its recent
soft patch and be boosted by the implementation of structural reforms.
Relative to the January Tealbook, we have marked down our forecast for the
EMEs. This downshift is particularly evident in China, where we see a sharper reining-in
of credit than previously anticipated, and in Brazil, where elevated inflation in the face of
unaddressed structural problems will weigh on activity.
Taking a longer view, we see EME growth settling at a pace that, at 4½ percent,
is considerably below that observed in the several years prior to the global financial
crisis. The slowdown is greater in emerging Asia, particularly China, where the aging of
the population and the lessening of opportunities for technological catch-up as these
economies mature should lower potential growth. Our path for economic activity in the
EMEs is also predicated on the assumption that monetary policy normalization in the
advanced economies does not severely disrupt financial or economic conditions in the
EMEs. Under this assumption, the situation improves for vulnerable EMEs and the

The Bank of England’s Next Phase of Forward Guidance
Following a much more rapid drop in the unemployment rate than was anticipated when the
Bank of England (BOE) introduced its forward guidance last August, the BOE’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) provided new guidance in February on how it will set monetary policy once
the unemployment rate has crossed the policy threshold.
The BOE’s August announcement of forward guidance focused on reassuring the public that it
would not consider raising its policy rate at least until the unemployment rate fell below a
threshold of 7 percent or one of three “knockouts” materialized. The knockouts were stated
as: (1) the MPC projects CPI inflation 18 to 24 months ahead to be 0.5 percentage point or more
above the 2 percent target, (2) “medium-term inflation expectations no longer remain
k
o sufficiently well anchored,” and (3) “The Financial Policy Committee judges that the stance of
o
l monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability. . .” At the time of the August
t
u
O announcement, the MPC projected that the unemployment rate (shown in the upper-left figure
on the following page) would remain above the threshold until late 2016. Since then, however,
&
l U.K. employment has grown rapidly and the unemployment rate has fallen surprisingly quickly
e
v to 7.2 percent by December.
e
D
n The BOE’s new guidance, published in its February Inflation Report, provides little concrete
o
c information about the likely timing of liftoff of the policy rate, aside from the assertion that the
E
l MPC sees further scope to reduce spare capacity before raising the Bank Rate from its present
’
t
n level of 0.5 percent. Instead, the guidance aims to inform the public about the factors likely to
I
be most influential in determining the pace at which policy accommodation is removed over the
next couple of years as well as the factors likely to affect policy in the medium run after inflation
and resource gaps have closed.
More specifically, there are four key facets of the new guidance. First, it ties policy rate
adjustment not only to keeping inflation near the BOE’s 2 percent target but also to “avoiding
wasteful spare capacity” in the U.K. economy. At the moment, the MPC judges that spare
capacity is equivalent to 1 to 1½ percent of GDP and is concentrated in the labor market. This
estimate reflects the gap between the unemployment rate and its estimated medium-term
equilibrium rate of 6 to 6½ percent as well as the shortfall of average hours worked relative to
employees’ desired hours (illustrated in the upper-right figure by the rise in those working part
time because they could not find a full-time job).
Second, as the new guidance does not contain a threshold once the unemployment rate falls
below 7 percent, the inflation and financial stability knockouts will not continue. The inflation
knockouts will be replaced by the normal discussion of the inflation forecast, and the financial
stability knockout will be replaced by a statement that monetary policy is a last line of defense
in mitigating financial stability risks, suggesting a clear division of labor between monetary
policy and macroprudential policy.
Third, the MPC projects that the eventual increase in its policy rate will be gradual, based on its
assessment that the recovery will continue to be restrained by several headwinds, including
restrictive fiscal policy, elevated interest rate spreads, and subdued global demand. Moreover,
the MPC thinks that productivity growth, which plunged during the recession and has
disappointed during the recovery, will gradually increase. In the MPC’s view, faster productivity
growth would slow employment growth, allowing output to expand briskly while limiting wage
Page 40 of 96

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
and price pressures (shown in the lower-left figure). (Given the U.K.’s strong job growth in
recent months, this part of the MPC’s outlook seems especially subject to risks.) Finally,
inflation is expected to remain at, or a little below, target in the next three years.
Fourth, the MPC indicated that, even when the economy will be operating at normal levels of
capacity with inflation close to target, its policy rate in the medium term likely will be materially
lower than its pre-crisis average of 5 percent, reflecting the persistent economic headwinds
listed above. The MPC signaled that the lower rate in the medium term is also consistent with
the global downward trend in real interest rates that started before the financial crisis.
Governor Carney suggested that one possible path of the Bank Rate is that implied by market
expectations, which puts the Bank Rate at the end of 2016 at around 2 percent.
Market reaction to the new guidance was quite muted, with little change to policy expectations
k
(shown in the lower-right figure). In our view, the new guidance is likely to play a constructive o
o
role in reassuring markets that liftoff is probably a ways off and that future rate increases likely l
t
u
will be gradual. Moreover, we find it useful that the guidance is linked to the degree of overall O
spare capacity in the U.K. economy, which the BOE has attempted to measure and forecast. &
However, the new guidance does not communicate how the MPC would respond to shocks, l
e
beyond noting that the Bank Rate would rise more slowly if the recovery falters or more quickly v
e
if inflation picks up. Thus, it remains to be seen whether this guidance will prove to be useful in D
shaping future market expectations as the recovery progresses. n

malaise recently seen in Latin America gradually lifts. However, as discussed earlier, we
continue to view a broad EME financial crisis as a notable downside risk to the outlook.
We estimate that quarterly inflation in the EMEs fell to 2¾ percent in the current
quarter, primarily reflecting a dip in Asian inflation. We expect EME inflation to rise
again as a rebound of inflation in emerging Asia more than offsets a moderation in Latin
America. Central banks in Argentina, Brazil, India, South Africa, and Turkey tightened
policy during the intermeeting period to contain inflation and support their currencies,
while those in Chile, Israel, and Thailand cut rates, citing growth concerns.
k
o China
o
l
t
u Chinese economic indicators are difficult to interpret this time of year due to the
O
& irregular timing of the Chinese New Year holiday but, on balance, appear consistent with
l
e moderation from the robust pace of growth in the second half of last year. Of note, the
v
e
D official PMI moved down in January and February and currently stands at around 50, a
n
o level we judge to be consistent with growth of 7 to 8 percent. Although credit growth
c
E
l remains relatively strong, our sense is that rising interest rates, amid a steady rollout of
’
t
n
I new regulations aimed at reining in the shadow banking sector, will curb investment
more than we previously anticipated. As a result, we now expect growth to fall to
7¼ percent this year—½ percentage point below what we wrote down in the January
Tealbook—from 7½ percent last year. We expect growth to remain a little above
7 percent in 2015 and 2016. Although we see a risk that the combination of slowing
growth and tightening credit could trigger a financial crisis, we do not view this scenario
as very likely.
We estimate that consumer price inflation fell to 1 percent at an annual rate in the
current quarter, reflecting both a decline in pork prices and a pronounced easing of core
inflation. Inflation should rise to 3¼ percent next quarter as some of the decline in pork
prices is reversed and core inflation firms, before stabilizing at about 3 percent for the
remainder of the forecast period.
As noted in the Financial Developments section, Chinese authorities engineered a
notable 1½ percent depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar during the
intermeeting period, likely in order to flush out speculative positions betting on continued
appreciation of the currency. At this point, we do not believe this move is the start of a
Page 42 of 96

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
sustained depreciation to support growth, as this would undermine the authorities’ stated
intention to liberalize the exchange rate and rebalance the economy.
Other Emerging Asia
Growth in the other emerging Asian economies picked up to a brisk 5¼ percent
annual pace in the fourth quarter, nearly a percentage point stronger than we were
expecting. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan all registered
very strong growth of 6 percent or more. The region’s growth was boosted by a pickup
in exports at the end of last year, reflecting in part strong shipments of high-tech
products. However, available indicators for the current quarter, including PMIs,
k
o
industrial production, and exports, suggest that growth slowed from the above-trend pace o
l
t
u
of the fourth quarter. We expect growth to dip to 3¾ percent this quarter, before rising
O
gradually to 4½ percent by early next year. &
l
e
v
e
We estimate that consumer price inflation fell to an annual rate of 2½ percent in D
n
the current quarter from higher-than-usual rates in the previous several quarters. This dip o
c
E
was largely driven by a sharp decline in food price inflation in India. We expect inflation
l
’
t
n
to rise again going forward, stabilizing at about 3½ percent by the end of this year.
I
Latin America
Mexico’s economy stalled unexpectedly in the fourth quarter, with real GDP
growing at just ¾ percent, as auto plants closed for retooling and consumer confidence
fell. A subsequent bounceback in auto production in the first two months of the year
provides comfort that some of the fourth-quarter weakness was transitory. However, the
significant downward revision in the outlook for U.S. manufacturing production led us to
mark down our forecast for Mexican growth in the first half of this year. We now see
growth rising to only 2½ percent in the current quarter, before picking up to 3½ percent
by the end of the year as U.S. manufacturing output firms.
We estimate that consumer price inflation in Mexico spiked to 5½ percent in the
current quarter, on the back of hikes in VAT rates and administered prices for gasoline
and public transport. The effects of these increases should be temporary, and we expect
inflation to decline to about 3½ percent by the second half of this year, within the central
bank’s target band of 2 to 4 percent.
After contracting in the third quarter, Brazil’s real GDP grew at a stronger-than-
expected 2¾ percent rate in the fourth quarter. However, recent weakness in industrial
Page 43 of 96

--- Page 47 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
production, exports, PMI, and consumer confidence caused us to revise down growth in
the current quarter by 2 percentage points to a mere ½ percent. We have also grown
gloomier about Brazil’s economic prospects as fiscal and monetary tightening, as well as
slower growth in key trading partners, including China, Argentina, and Venezuela, are
expected to weigh on growth. Our downward revision also reflects a reassessment of
Brazil’s potential growth in light of continued elevated inflation despite weak activity.
We now see growth picking up to about 2½ percent by the end of this year and edging up
only slightly thereafter. Beyond the current quarter, our outlook is about ¾ percentage
point lower throughout the forecast period than in the January Tealbook.
k
o
o Inflation continues to hover around 6 percent in Brazil, a reflection of tight labor
l
t
u market conditions, pass-through from the depreciation of the real in recent months, and
O
& persistently high inflation expectations. Citing concerns over inflationary pressures,
l
e
v Brazil’s central bank raised its main policy rate a further 25 basis points in February,
e
D
bringing the cumulative increase during the current tightening cycle to 350 basis points.
n
o We expect inflation to fall gradually as this tightening takes effect, reaching about
c
E
l 5½ percent by the end of this year. Inflation has risen sharply elsewhere in South
’
t
n
I America, notably in Argentina and Venezuela, whose currencies have depreciated
sharply. In February, Argentina, which has long been suspected of underreporting
inflation, introduced a long-awaited new consumer price index. The index showed a
3.7 percent increase (not at an annual rate) in January, consistent with private estimates.
Other Emerging Market Economies
Ukraine is on the verge of economic collapse. During the intermeeting period,
pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovich was ousted after months of political protests.
Accelerating capital outflows as the political crisis deepened forced Ukrainian authorities
to abandon the currency peg and expand capital controls. Russia’s subsequent decision to
deploy armed soldiers to Crimea led to a sharp escalation in geopolitical tensions with
brief but unsettling reverberations throughout global financial markets.
Although markets rebounded, the risk of further turmoil remains significant,
especially given the lack of a clear way forward. The United States has responded by
imposing sanctions on certain Russian individuals linked with the invasion of Crimea. It
remains uncertain how Europe, which depends heavily on Russia for its oil and gas, will
respond. Ukraine’s transitional government is now in talks with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western governments to secure external financing, although
Page 44 of 96

--- Page 48 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) March 12, 2014
negotiations are expected to be challenging given the unstable political situation and
Ukraine’s checkered history with IMF adjustment programs. Should the crisis intensify,
and especially if geopolitical tensions flare up again, there could be significant effects on
world commodity and financial markets and, at an extreme, adverse consequences for the
global economic outlook.

Financial Developments
Market participants appeared to discount the generally weaker-than-expected
U.S. economic data released over the intermeeting period in light of the possible
temporary effects of unusually cold weather. In addition, investors appeared to become
broadly more willing to take riskier positions, likely due in part to an easing of concerns
about financial stresses in the emerging market economies (EMEs) early in the
intermeeting period. On balance, the path of the federal funds rate was little changed, as
were longer-term Treasury yields; however, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads
narrowed—particularly for speculative-grade issues—and the dollar depreciated slightly.
• FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were about in line
with market expectations. The Open Market Desk’s March Survey of
Primary Dealers suggests that most dealers expect the Committee to
change its forward-guidance language at the upcoming meeting, with
many anticipating a shift toward qualitative guidance.
• Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained robust. Financing
conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets continued to improve
gradually. s
t
n
e
m
• Credit conditions in residential mortgage markets remained tight, even as p
o
l
further incremental signs of easing emerged. Access to credit cards e
v
e
continued to be tight for borrowers with low credit scores, while auto and D
l
a
student loans stayed widely available. i
c
n
a
n
• Asset price movements in foreign financial markets were broadly similar F i
to those in the United States. Global financial market volatility increased
only temporarily with the turmoil in Ukraine. Notably, the Bank of
England updated its forward guidance, stating that there remains scope to
absorb spare capacity further before raising its policy rate.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
Market reactions to FOMC communications were muted over the intermeeting
period. The January FOMC decision and statement were largely anticipated by market
participants. The Monetary Policy Report and Chair Yellen’s congressional testimony
were viewed as emphasizing continuity in the approach to monetary policy, solidifying
expectations that the pace of the FOMC’s asset purchases would be reduced by a further
$10 billion at each upcoming meeting absent a material change in the economic outlook.
Following the release of the January FOMC minutes on February 19, market commentary
noted that meeting participants seemed to attribute the soft economic data, at least in part,
to adverse winter weather.
Policy expectations moved little, on net, over the intermeeting period. The path
of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes was little changed, and the
Desk’s March Survey of Primary Dealers indicates that dealers’ expectations about
monetary policy—including the projected path of the federal funds rate and SOMA
holdings—have held steady since January.1 However, most dealers now expect the
Committee to modify its forward rate guidance at the March meeting, and dealers appear
to see substantial odds that the threshold-based guidance will be de-emphasized or
dropped and replaced with qualitative guidance.
s
t
n
Treasury yields were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, as
e
m
waning flight-to-quality demands early in the period appeared to offset generally weaker- p
o
l
than-expected economic data releases. Investors reportedly attributed the softer data, to e
v
e
some extent, to adverse weather conditions. On net, 5-year Treasury yields edged up D
l
a
4 basis points since the January FOMC meeting, 10-year Treasury yields were i
c
n
unchanged, agency MBS yields ticked up 4 basis points, and option-adjusted spreads on a
n
i
production-coupon MBS were about unchanged. TIPS-based measures of inflation F
compensation were also little changed.
1 According to the results from the Desk’s pilot survey of market participants, which was
conducted for the second time in March with a modestly expanded panel of respondents, expectations of
active investors are broadly in line with those of the primary dealers.

TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING
Since the January FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department auctioned
$230 billion of nominal fixed-rate coupon securities and $9 billion of TIPS. In addition,
the Treasury’s first-ever auction of a floating-rate note (FRN) on January 29 was well
received, as was the subsequent reopening, with a broad set of investors (including
foreign central banks, hedge funds, and corporate cash managers) reportedly participating
in the auctions. In total, the Treasury has issued $28 billion of two-year FRNs. The
February Quarterly Refunding Statement noted that the Treasury expects to auction
additional FRNs quarterly (each with two monthly reopenings).
Federal Reserve purchase operations did not appear to have any material adverse
effect on the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets.2 As in the fourth quarter
of 2013, the size of SOMA settlements roughly equaled the gross issuance of agency
MBS in January and February. Dollar-roll-implied financing rates for production-coupon
MBS moved lower, although they remained in recent ranges.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over
the intermeeting period.3 In mid-February, the Congress passed legislation suspending
s
the debt ceiling until March 2015. In response to news of the pending legislation, yields t

flow-based Treasury purchase program and $66 billion of agency MBS under the flow-based MBS

intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

time, both at overnight and term maturities. Early in the period, market repurchase rates
were low and even dipped below the fixed rate, prompting high take-up in the
operations. Later on, repurchase rates moved higher, apparently in response to a rise in
Treasury bill issuance, and operation volumes moderated.
Responses to the March 2014 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer
Financing Terms suggested little change over the past three months both in conditions in
securities financing and OTC derivatives markets and in credit terms applicable to most
classes of counterparties covered by the survey. However, nearly one-half of the dealers
surveyed reported an increase in demand for funding of non-agency RMBS. Also of note
was the result that roughly two-fifths of the dealers indicated some decline over the past
three months in the use of financial leverage at trading real estate investment trusts.
EQUITY VALUATIONS AND BOND SPREADS
Broad stock price indexes ended the intermeeting period up about 4 percent,
despite generally weaker-than-expected economic data. Investors attributed the
weakness, to some extent, to the temporary effects of unusually harsh winter weather.
Share prices also appeared to be boosted by a solid finish to the corporate earnings
season, as well as by a broad increase in investors’ willingness to take riskier positions,
likely reflecting, in part, an easing of concerns about EMEs early in the period.4 The

of proceeds going to investment-grade firms. In addition, the growth of C&I loans on
banks’ balance sheets remained solid in January and surged in February. Institutional
issuance of leveraged loans has continued to be quite brisk this year; strong inflows into
the asset class by retail and institutional investors have contributed to a further easing of
lending standards and terms, which, in turn, has spurred additional refinancing
activity. Secondary-market equity offerings by nonfinancial companies also remained
robust, but the volume of IPOs was seasonally sluggish.
While Call Report data suggest that banks still have not appreciably increased
their lending to small businesses—even as credit supply to established small businesses
has reportedly eased—preliminary analysis of PayNet data suggests that credit flows
from nonbank lenders may have increased (see the box “Small Business Financing
Conditions”).
Demand for credit by nonfinancial corporations was likely boosted by merger and
acquisition activity, which increased further in the final quarter of 2013. The pace of new
deals was particularly notable for technology and health-care firms. The recent volume
of announced and pending deals suggests another step-up in merger activity in coming
months.
Financing conditions in CRE markets continued to improve gradually. CRE loans
s
t
n
on banks’ books increased at a solid pace over the first two months of the year, and, e
m
according to the most recent Call Report data, the fourth-quarter increases in banks’ CRE p
o
l
loans were widespread across all major categories, including construction and land e
v
e
D
development loans. After a slow start in January, CMBS issuance was robust in
l
a
February. Underwriting standards for commercial mortgages have reportedly continued i
c
n
to ease somewhat as competition among lenders has intensified, although banks’ lending a
n
i
F
standards do not appear to be nearly as loose as those prevailing in 2006 and 2007.
Conditions in the municipal bond market remained favorable over the
intermeeting period. Municipal bond yield ratios and the MCDX, an index of CDS for a
broad portfolio of municipal bonds, changed relatively little. That said, the City of
Detroit proposed a bankruptcy plan that offers much lower recovery rates for its
bondholders than would be suggested by historical benchmarks. Moreover, Standard &
Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings downgraded Puerto Rico’s general
obligation (GO) bonds from investment grade to speculative grade over the
period. However, the prices of Puerto Rico GO bonds held steady through these events,

Small Business Financing Conditions
After declining sharply in the wake of the financial crisis, commercial lending by domestic banks
began to rebound in late 2010. However, the recovery has not been uniform. According to Call
Report data, outstanding large loans to businesses (a rough proxy for loans to large businesses)
have grown rapidly since late 2010, while outstanding small loans to businesses (a rough proxy
for loans to small businesses) continued to decline into 2013 and have remained essentially flat
since then (figure 1).
This stagnation in outstanding small loans is a bit puzzling in light of improving credit supply
conditions for small businesses. Beginning in mid-2007, respondents to the Federal Reserve
Board’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported a sustained
period of tightening of standards and terms on loans to small businesses. However, since mid-
2010, banks have generally been reporting a net easing of standards and terms to such firms.
Similarly, small business borrowers reported substantial difficulty obtaining credit during and
immediately following the financial crisis, but they have been reporting gradually improving
access to credit since 2011. The most recent data from the National Federation of Independent
Business (NFIB) monthly member polls indicate that, among firms applying for credit, the
fraction reporting that their credit needs were satisfied has returned to near pre-crisis levels. In
addition, in the January 2014 Wells Fargo Small Business Index (WFSBI) survey, the fraction of
respondents reporting that credit was very difficult or somewhat difficult to obtain in the past
12 months declined to levels not seen since early 2009, though it remained elevated relative to
pre-crisis norms.
s At least part of the explanation for the low levels of outstanding small loans seems to be
t
n
e lackluster demand by small businesses for new loans. Only 13 percent of the respondents to the
m
January 2014 WFSBI survey reported that they intended to apply for a new credit product in the
p
o next 12 months—a share that is essentially unchanged from the previous seven quarters.
l
e
v Among NFIB members, 53 percent of respondents to the February 2014 member poll explicitly
e
D stated that they were not interested in a loan, suggesting that the share of firms with

borrowing needs is well below historical averages. Weak loan demand from small businesses
likely reflects, at least in part, their reluctance to expand. The share of respondents to the
NFIB’s member poll who view the next three months as a good time for expansion has
fluctuated between 5 and 10 percent since early 2008—a level that is quite low by historical
standards.
To gain additional insights into small businesses’ access to credit, the Board recently acquired
more-detailed quarterly data on small business lending from PayNet, a consortium of
commercial banks, credit unions, captive and noncaptive finance companies, and alternative
lenders that collects loan-level information on commercial loans and leases from individual
lenders to small businesses. PayNet analyzes the data and constructs the Thomson
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index (SBLI), which aims to track originations of new
loans to small businesses. The index is based on the monthly dollar-weighted percentage
change in loan originations to small businesses. The SBLI suggests that loan originations to
small businesses by lenders of all types have been trending upward since mid-2009 (figure 2).
At this point, we cannot determine the extent to which the differences in trends between the
Call Report data and the PayNet data reflect the fact that PayNet measures loan originations
while Call Reports measure outstanding loan balances, the fact that the two data sources
capture the activities of different groups of lenders and credit products, or something else. The
Call Report data are limited to the universe of U.S. banks. About 50 percent of loan dollars
originated in the PayNet data are attributed to a subset of participating U.S. banks, about
30 percent to a number of captive finance companies, and the remaining 20 percent to some
noncaptive finance companies, credit unions, and alternative lenders. The lenders that do not
report to PayNet may be having very different experiences in terms of loan originations to small
s
businesses than those that do report. t
n
e
m
To the extent that the increased originations may be driven in part by alternative lenders, one p
o
should be cautious about interpreting them too positively. Alternative lenders generally make e l
v
small, short-term loans at high interest rates, typically with annual percentage rates greater e
D
than 30 percent. l

albeit at substantially depressed levels, as the rating changes were largely anticipated. On
March 11, 2014, Puerto Rico successfully brought to market a $3.5 billion GO bond
issue, substantially easing near-term liquidity pressures.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Financing conditions in mortgage markets have remained tight, particularly for
borrowers with low credit scores. However, a few signs that mortgage markets may have
begun to ease emerged over the intermeeting period. In particular, the lower end of the
distribution of credit scores for GSE-backed purchase mortgages shifted down slightly in
December. In addition, a major residential mortgage lender announced plans to decrease
its minimum required credit scores on mortgages eligible to be guaranteed by the FHA.
House prices rose notably further in January, and mortgage interest rates and their
spreads to Treasury yields were little changed over the intermeeting period. Applications
for both purchase mortgages and refinancings stayed at low levels through early March.
Conditions in consumer credit markets have remained mixed. Credit bureau data
through the fourth quarter indicate that auto loans continued to be broadly available,
including to consumers with subprime credit histories. Meanwhile, credit card limits for
borrowers with subprime and prime credit scores—a proxy for supply—remained at very
low levels through the fourth quarter. Partly reflecting these supply conditions, credit
s
t
n
card balances stayed nearly flat, on net, through January, while auto and student loans
e
m
continued to grow briskly. Consumer loans on banks’ books posted only modest gains in p
o
l
February, likely owing to a weather-related moderation in auto loan growth. Issuance of e

auto and credit card ABS continued to be robust in January and February, including D

BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY F i
On net, stock prices for large bank holding companies (BHCs) increased about in
line with the broad equity market over the intermeeting period, while CDS spreads for
such firms remained low. The profitability of BHCs increased in the fourth quarter of
2013, supported by further declines in loan loss provisions and a reduction in litigation
expenses, even as BHCs generally continued to report compressed net interest margins,
weak mortgage revenues, and relatively subdued trading income. Loan performance
improved further across most loan types, and banks’ loan loss reserves relative to net
charge-offs increased.

M2 grew briskly, on average, over January and February, owing mainly to gains
in liquid deposits. The monetary base expanded at a slower rate, on average, than in
2013, as the rate of increase in reserve balances was constrained by the reduced pace of
asset purchases and the larger sizes of operations in the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP
exercise.5
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Financial market sentiment abroad appeared to improve over the period. In
particular, financial stresses in the EMEs, which reached a peak in the days just prior to
the January FOMC meeting, appear to have eased, as central banks in some of the most
vulnerable economies raised policy rates.
Although global markets fell abruptly on March 3, following the deepening of the
political crisis in Ukraine, most markets quickly retraced these losses. Both the Russian
ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia depreciated over the period, and local-currency
sovereign bond yields rose about 70 basis points and 140 basis points in Russia and
Ukraine, respectively.
The currencies of most EMEs recovered notably with respect to the dollar as
stresses eased early in the intermeeting period. Local-currency sovereign bond yields
s
declined in most emerging markets, and EMBI spreads narrowed. In addition, stock n t
e
m
markets in many EMEs retraced the losses experienced in late January, and the pace of
p
o
outflows from EME-dedicated mutual funds slowed. l

c
sentiment, the currencies of most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) appreciated n

against the dollar as flight-to-safety flows reversed. Headline equity indexes in the AFEs
i
F
also increased substantially. Long-term sovereign bond yields and market-based
measures of policy expectations were little changed, on net, over the period. Peripheral
euro-area interest rate spreads continued to narrow.
5 During the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve announced that it would conduct a series of
four seven-day TDF operations in March; on average over the first two operations, tenders totaled
$14.4 billion, with 28 participants. The last operation in this series will employ a floating-rate format, with
the rate set equal to the sum of the interest rate paid on excess reserves and a fixed spread of 1 basis point,
resulting in an effective rate of 26 basis points.

The Bank of England updated its forward guidance in February, stating that, even
with the unemployment rate near its 7 percent threshold, there remains scope to absorb
spare capacity further before raising its policy rate. The Bank also stated that future rate
increases are likely to be gradual and that the eventual level of rates is likely to be below
the 5 percent pre-crisis average (see the box “The Bank of England’s Next Phase of
Forward Guidance” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).
Market-based measures of expected policy rates moved up slightly on the release. The
Bank of Japan (BOJ) renewed and expanded its funding-for-lending programs, and
market participants continue to expect the BOJ to implement further easing this year.
The European Central Bank kept its policy rate unchanged.
The People’s Bank of China pushed the value of the Chinese renminbi down
about 1½ percent against the dollar over the period. Market commentary suggested that
the depreciation may have been engineered to introduce two-way risk in the currency
market and so reduce speculative capital inflows. Separately, a Chinese company failed
to make a scheduled interest payment on its outstanding bonds, reportedly the first
corporate bond default in the People’s Republic of China since 1997. Observers had long
believed that the authorities should allow such a default in order to instill market
discipline; in the event, the default did not elicit any substantive market reaction.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the extent of uncertainty around our projections for real
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable
volatility.1 We see a number of risks attending our forecast for economic activity,
including those posed by the possibility that the recent softer tone in spending and
production data may signal weaker momentum in aggregate demand than we have
projected, that the economy has incurred more supply-side damage since the recession
than we have assumed, or that economic and financial stresses in emerging market
economies (EMEs) will intensify. Importantly, we see neither monetary policy nor fiscal
policy as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks. Given
these considerations, we continue to believe that the risks to our forecast for real GDP
growth are tilted a little to the downside. However, we view the uncertainty around our
projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher
unemployment rate from adverse demand-side developments largely countered by the
possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to surprise us to the downside as it
has in recent years, despite the further reduction of our estimate of potential GDP growth
in the current Tealbook.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s ongoing
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment. Overall, the vulnerabilities of the financial
system to adverse shocks appear to remain at moderate levels. This perspective is
predicated, in part, on the relatively strong capital positions of large domestic banking
firms, the generally low leverage and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the
nonfinancial sectors, and the reduced reliance on fragile short-term wholesale funding

across the financial sector in recent years.2 That said, short-term funding continues to be
an important structural vulnerability for the financial system, as do the complexity and
interconnectedness of the largest financial institutions. Valuations in major domestic
asset markets still appear to be broadly in line with historical norms, although equities in
a few segments of the stock market, including social media and biotechnology, appear to
have become increasingly overvalued. In addition, investor demand for riskier corporate
credit has continued to be very strong, contributing to rapid credit growth and more-
aggressive underwriting in the leveraged finance sector and to the lowest levels of risk
spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds since 2007, albeit in the context of strong
corporate balance sheets and cash flows.
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. Longer-run inflation
expectations appear to have remained stable in recent years despite fluctuations in the
prices of crude oil, other commodities, and imports more generally, as well as persistent
margins of slack in labor and product markets. Furthermore, we still view the risks to our
inflation forecast as broadly balanced. On the downside, there is the possibility that the
soft readings on inflation seen since the beginning of last year could prove more
persistent than we expect, especially if longer-term inflation expectations move down or
if low levels of resource utilization and subdued increases in unit labor costs persist
longer or have larger effects than we currently project. On the upside, an increase in
inflation expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of
policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could significant unanticipated increases in oil and
other commodity prices caused by overseas developments, a stronger-than-expected
economic recovery, or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than
is assumed in the baseline.

contrast, the second scenario assumes that inclement weather may have masked greater
underlying momentum in household spending than is reflected in the baseline; thus, the
economic recovery accelerates at a faster pace than we have projected. In the third
scenario, the reduction in potential output growth is eventually realized to be deeper and
more persistent than assumed in the baseline. The fourth scenario considers the risk that
the softness in consumer price inflation seen over the past year could prove to be more
persistent than anticipated. The final two scenarios consider risks to the U.S. economy
from foreign economic developments—first, that the dollar could appreciate rather than
depreciate as in the baseline, and, second, that a dramatic increase in financial stress in
EMEs could have substantial negative spillovers to the U.S. economy.
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two
using the multicountry SIGMA model. Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its
zero lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast—by an
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. The date of liftoff in each scenario takes into
account the guidance provided in the Committee’s January statement indicating that the
liftoff date will depend on when the asset purchase program ends, when the
unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and how the Committee’s outlook for inflation
stands. In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio
follow their baseline paths.
Weaker Household Demand
In the baseline projection, the unanticipated slowdown in the pace of consumer
spending growth over the past few months is assumed to be transitory, and continued
improvements in consumer sentiment, households’ financial conditions, and labor market
prospects lead to an acceleration in household spending; the projected resumption of the
housing market recovery is expected to reinforce this acceleration. By contrast, this
scenario assumes that the recent downside surprises in household spending signal greater
caution on the part of households in the face of continued uncertainty about the pace of
the economic recovery and their employment prospects. These conditions spawn a cycle
of restrained household spending and residential investment that, in turn, leads to a
y
t
n
slower pace of business investment and hiring. All told, real GDP rises at an average i
a
t
annual rate of 2 percent over the next three years, 1 percentage point lower than in the e r
c
n
baseline, and the unemployment rate declines more gradually, falling to only around U
6 percent in 2016. With a wider margin of resource slack than in the baseline, inflation &

rises somewhat more slowly. The federal funds rate lifts off in the first quarter of 2017 s

(seven quarters later than in the baseline) and rises more gradually thereafter, reaching
2 percent by the end of 2018.3
Faster Recovery
In the staff’s view, the recent softer spending data reflect both the effects of
adverse weather and a somewhat more subdued state of underlying demand than we had
previously projected. However, some outside analysts have ascribed a considerably
larger portion of the recent weakness in spending to the weather. In this scenario, we
assume that adverse weather conditions have been masking, to a greater extent than in the
baseline, a more robust underlying trajectory in private-sector demand. Continued
improvements in labor market conditions and generally positive readings on consumer
and business confidence may support this view. Thus, as the weather returns to normal
and the labor market continues to improve, the stronger underlying momentum in
household spending starts to show through, which in turn leads businesses to be more
willing to invest, fostering a faster, more broadly based recovery. Real GDP rises at an
average annual rate of 3¾ percent over the next three years, and the unemployment rate
falls to 5 percent by the end of 2015. Inflation reaches its 2 percent target level by early
2018. The federal funds rate lifts off one quarter earlier than in the baseline and rises
more steeply thereafter, reaching 5¼ percent by the end of 2018.
Supply-Side Damage
Over the past three years, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1 percentage
point per year despite only moderate increases in real GDP. The staff has therefore
marked down its estimate of the pace of potential output growth, and in the current
forecast, we have lowered the growth rate of potential GDP from 2011 through 2016
somewhat further. However, some of the models we consult suggest that the damage to
aggregate supply during the past several years may have been even greater than is
assumed in the current baseline. This scenario assumes a slower pace of structural
productivity gains such that potential output has expanded at an annual rate of only
1¼ percent starting in 2011, ¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline. As a result,
the level of potential output is currently ¾ percentage point lower. Thereafter, potential y

affect the liftoff date. R i

GDP continues to grow at a 1¼ percent pace through 2018; the level of potential output is
4½ percentage points lower at the end of 2018 than in the baseline.
Real GDP rises at a rate of 2¾ percent this year and next, slower than in the
baseline projection by ¼ percentage point and ½ percentage point, respectively.
Thereafter, the pace of economic growth gradually slows, and real GDP rises at an annual
rate of only 1¼ percent in 2017 and 2018. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate continues
to decline rapidly, reaching 5 percent in the middle of 2016. With resource slack
substantially narrower and productivity gains smaller, inflation rises to 2 percent in early
2016 and edges up to nearly 2½ percent in 2018. Initially, policymakers continue to
perceive supply-side conditions as consistent with the staff’s baseline view. As evidence
of the weaker supply-side conditions mounts, their perceptions gradually come in line
with reality and are assumed to be fully adjusted by 2016. Given the initial
misperception of slack and the gradual response of inflation to higher resource utilization,
the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the second quarter
of 2015, the same quarter as in the baseline, but it thereafter rises more steeply as
policymakers recognize the weaker supply-side conditions.
Low Inflation
In the baseline projection, the downside surprise on core inflation over the past
year is assumed to be largely transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradually
moves up toward 2 percent as the recovery continues. This forecast is based on the
staff’s assumption that long-run inflation expectations are firmly anchored at the
Committee’s longer-run inflation target of 2 percent. In this scenario, we examine the
possibility that the extended experience of below-target inflation has led to a reduction in
current long-run inflation expectations to about 1½ percent, and that continued low
inflation in the coming years leads to further erosion in these expectations. As a
consequence, prices rise only 1 percent this year and inflation remains below 1 percent
through 2018. Persistently low inflation in this scenario causes liftoff to occur in mid-
2018, three years later than in the baseline. At that time, the unemployment rate has
declined to 4½ percent, ¾ percentage point below its natural rate. However, given the

decline in long-horizon inflation expectations, inflation projected one to two years ahead
is still well below the Committee’s target despite this degree of labor market tightness.4
Stronger Dollar
As discussed in the box “The Path of the Dollar: Baseline and Alternatives” in
the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section, we project that the dollar
will depreciate gradually over the next few years. However, it is possible that rising
interest rates associated with a prospective withdrawal of policy accommodation in the
United States and the AFEs may take investors somewhat by surprise, inducing a
progressive shift into dollar-denominated assets and contributing to somewhat greater
financial stresses in the EMEs.5 In this scenario, the broad real dollar appreciates about
1 percent by the end of 2016—rather than depreciating 3 percent, as in the baseline—
largely because of foreign exchange risk premium shocks. We also assume modest
negative shocks to confidence and credit conditions in the EMEs. The stronger exchange
value of the dollar and weaker foreign activity reduce U.S. real net exports. All told, U.S.
real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 2¾ percent, on average, in 2014 and 2015—
¼ percentage point below the baseline. The weaker U.S. activity and lower import price
inflation cause core inflation to run about 0.1 percentage point below baseline throughout
the forecast horizon and induce a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate.6
Financial Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies
We expect financial market stresses in the EMEs to remain generally manageable.
However, with investors focused on both EME vulnerabilities and the prospective effects
of policy normalization in advanced economies, the risk of a substantial ratcheting up of
financial stress in the EMEs remains significant. Any number of events could trigger
such a development, including an intensification of the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine. In
this scenario, we consider the effects of a financial crisis that engulfs many EMEs.
Sovereign and private borrowing costs in these countries soar, and the confidence of their
households and businesses weakens significantly. These events cause EME currencies to

5 An alternative possibility for a stronger dollar path that is discussed in the box is that China and e r
c
other EMEs might allow their currencies to appreciate less quickly than assumed in our baseline. n
6 In this scenario and the next, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the one used in the first U
&
three domestic scenarios. One key difference relative to the FRB/US simulations is that the policy rule in
s
SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of k
s
the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices. R i

depreciate roughly 8 percent, on average, against the dollar relative to the baseline, even
though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates to attenuate capital outflows.
These factors lead real GDP in the EMEs to decline 4½ percent relative to the baseline by
early 2015.7
The stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to the rest of
the world. In the United States, corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline
relative to the baseline, while flight-to-safety flows push down term premiums on
government bond yields. In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger
exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports. As a result, U.S. real GDP growth
is around 2 percent in 2014, about 1 percentage point below baseline, and remains
subdued for another year. The unemployment rate hovers around 6½ percent through
mid-2015. With substantially greater resource slack and lower import prices, core U.S.
PCE inflation dips to nearly 1 percent in 2014. Under these conditions, the federal funds
rate remains at its effective lower bound five quarters longer than in the baseline.

Note: “Staff” represents Tealbook forecast errors applied to the Tealbook baseline; baselines for FRB/US, BVAR, EDO, and
the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.
