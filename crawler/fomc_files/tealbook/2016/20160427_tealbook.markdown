Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information we received during the intermeeting period about aggregate D
n
spending and production has been disappointing, with the discouraging news coming o
c
E
from most spending categories. We now estimate that real GDP edged up at an annual
c
i
t
rate of only ½ percent in the first quarter, compared with 2 percent in the March s
e
m
Tealbook. In contrast, incoming labor market data have remained solid, suggesting that o
D
the labor market has continued to improve at a pace roughly in line with our previous
forecast.
As in the two preceding years when we confronted a similar confluence of data,
we judge that some of the weakness in the spending indicators reflects influences, such as
residual seasonality, that will be reversed in subsequent quarters as well as observation
error. Accordingly, we made a downward adjustment to our estimate of potential output
in 2016 to reduce the effect of the weak spending data on our estimate of the output gap.
Nevertheless, we took some negative signal from the incoming data and now view the
current cyclical position of the economy as slightly weaker than we thought in the March
Tealbook forecast. In the current quarter, we expect real GDP growth to pick up to a
2¼ percent pace, similar to our previous forecast.
Beyond the near term, real GDP is projected to rise at an average annual rate of
2¼ percent through 2018. This forecast for GDP growth is a little stronger than in the
March Tealbook projection primarily because the paths for interest rates, equity prices,
and the dollar are more supportive. At the end of 2018, real GDP is expected to be about
1½ percent above our estimate of its potential and the unemployment rate is expected to
be 4.2 percent, 0.1 percentage point below the March Tealbook forecast and
¾ percentage point below our estimate for its natural rate.
Our forecast for PCE price inflation over the first half of this year is the same as
in the previous Tealbook, as recent news on inflation appears consistent with our view
that the January reading on core PCE inflation was transitorily high. We project that total
PCE price inflation will be about 1 percent this year and will move up to 1.8 percent in
2018, as energy and import prices begin to rise moderately later this year and as resource
utilization tightens further in an environment of reasonably stable long-run inflation
expectations.

The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is slightly lower than the median
D
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) in 2016 but in line with
n
o the Blue Chip consensus forecasts in 2016 and 2017. The staff’s forecast for
c
E unemployment is a little higher than the others in 2016 and the same in 2017. Its
c

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS u t
O
&
Monetary Policy
l
e
v
 We continue to use an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule to set e
D
the federal funds rate in the projection.1 A mechanical implementation of this n
o
c
rule calls for the federal funds rate to rise about 1 percentage point per year E
c
i
over the forecast period and to average 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of s t
e
m
2018.2 This level is slightly higher than in the March Tealbook, largely
o
D
reflecting tighter resource utilization in this projection.
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current size
until the fourth quarter of 2016 and then begin to contract as the proceeds
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 Compared with the March Tealbook, we have revised down somewhat the
entire projected path of the 10-year Treasury yield. This revision mostly
reflects our assessment that the demand for holding U.S. Treasury securities
and risks to the global growth outlook will keep term premiums well below
historical norms for longer than we had previously thought. The 25 basis
point downward revision from this reassessment is partly offset by the higher
projected path of future short-term interest rates. Nevertheless, our projection
continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise significantly over the
medium term, mostly reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation
window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates.
1 In the near term, the federal funds rate revised down a bit relative to the previous projection, as
the realized federal funds rate in the first quarter of 2016 was lower than the value prescribed by the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule. To help smooth the transition from one quarter to the next, we have modified our
procedure so that we now project the federal funds rate in the current quarter using the inertial Taylor
(1999) rule only for the remaining days of the quarter; for the period preceding the close of the forecast, we
use actual market quotes.
2 In light of the fact that the baseline path for the federal funds rate is somewhat above the median
projection from the most recent SEP, we are contemplating whether to modify our assumed policy rule for
the June Tealbook. In addition, to illustrate the sensitivity of the staff projection to changes in the federal
funds rate, we conducted a simulation using the FRB/US model under the assumption that the federal funds
rate remains flat through the end of 2016 and then reverts to the baseline rule starting in 2017:Q1. In this
scenario, the level of real GDP is 0.1 percent higher than in the baseline by the end of 2017, the
unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point lower, and core inflation is 4 basis points higher; the federal
funds rate remains lower, by nearly 40 basis points.

 We revised down the paths for the 10-year triple-B corporate bond rate and
O
& the 30-year mortgage rate about in line with the revision to Treasury yields.
l
e The spread of rates on 10-year triple-B corporate bonds over those on
v
e
D comparable-maturity Treasury securities, currently at elevated levels, is
n
o forecast to narrow slowly and end the projection period somewhat above its
c
E
historical median level.

Equity Prices and Home Prices
o
D
 Equity prices have increased 6¼ percent since the time of the March
Tealbook, but as the outlook for corporate earnings remains downbeat, we
have not passed through all of the recent upward movement in equity prices
into the forecast. Thus, the projected path for equity prices is only modestly
higher than in the March Tealbook, with stock prices projected to rise about
2¾ percent per year on average through 2018.
 We expect house prices to rise about 4 percent in 2016 and about 2¾ percent
per year in 2017 and 2018. We have revised up our expectations for the path
of house prices relative to the March Tealbook, largely in response to strong
incoming data. House prices currently appear slightly overvalued compared
to rents, with one measure we track suggesting that house prices are
overvalued by about 6 percent (compared with more than 40 percent prior to
the housing bust). Our forecast has house prices rising slightly slower than
rents over the medium term, which gradually reduces this overvaluation.
Fiscal Policy
 Our fiscal policy assumptions are unrevised in this forecast. We continue to
anticipate that the federal budget legislation that was passed at the end of last
year, combined with ongoing modest growth in state and local purchases, will
provide a boost of just over ½ percentage point to real GDP growth this year
and make smaller contributions in 2017 and 2018.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated almost 3 percent, on net, since the
time of the March Tealbook, primarily on expectations of more
accommodative monetary policy in the United States. We expect the nominal
dollar to edge up about 1 percent over the remainder of this year and then to

k
o
o
l
rise a total of 2¼ percent over the following two years, lifted by monetary u t
O
policy divergence between the United States and abroad. Our projection for
&
the level of the broad real dollar averages about 3 percent lower than in the e l
v
e
March Tealbook. D
n
o
c
 We estimate that foreign real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the E
c
first quarter, ¼ percentage point stronger than in the March Tealbook and t i
s
e
above the 1¾ percent pace of both the fourth quarter and 2015 as a whole. m
o
D
This step-up was largely driven by a rebound in Canadian activity, although
growth in emerging Asia (excluding China) and the euro area also improved
on the back of stronger domestic demand. As expected, economic growth in
China slowed in the first quarter, although we project that growth will pick up
in the remainder of the year, supported by further policy stimulus. Overall,
we see the pace of growth abroad edging up to 2¾ percent by the end of 2016
and then staying at about that rate through 2018, supported by accommodative
monetary policies and the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the
dollar over the past two years.
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil closed at $44 per barrel on April 19,
$4 above its level at the time of the previous Tealbook. Although the spot
price was volatile over the period, further-dated futures quotes were
unchanged relative to those in the March Tealbook. Overall, oil supply
continues to exceed oil demand, and global inventories are anticipated to
continue to accumulate in the near term. Thereafter, we expect the supply
imbalance to close. We therefore expect the price of imported oil to increase
only slightly, from $39 per barrel in the current quarter to $43 per barrel by
the end of 2018.
 Other commodity prices were mixed. Metals prices are little changed on
balance since the time of the previous Tealbook, remaining somewhat above
their trough in early 2016. Agricultural prices moved up on average, with
soybean prices boosted in part by stronger foreign demand.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP u t
O
&
The incoming data on spending and production in the first quarter were
l
e
v
substantially weaker than we had expected, leading us to mark down our estimate of real e
D
GDP growth last quarter to ½ percent at an annual rate—1½ percentage points less than n
o
in the March Tealbook.3 The downward revision was broad based across spending E c
c
categories, although weaker consumer spending accounted for more than half of the t i
s
e
revision.4 When considering our forecast for the current quarter, we discounted much of m
o
D
this disappointing news because of the inherent variability in the quarterly GDP data and
because it seems at odds with the ongoing improvement in the labor market, solid
measures of consumer sentiment, and the recent improvement in many forward-looking
indicators of business investment and production. Nonetheless, we marked down our
projection for growth in private domestic final purchases a little, although the effect on
GDP growth was more than offset by an upward revision from the contributions of net
exports and inventory investment. All told, we expect real GDP to rise 2¼ percent in the
second quarter, a little higher than in the March Tealbook.
 Real PCE growth appears to have slowed from an annual rate of 2½ percent in
the fourth quarter to 1¾ percent in the first quarter, in contrast with the slight
step-up in growth we projected in the March Tealbook. However, given
recent gains in household incomes and wealth, still-favorable readings on
consumer sentiment, and earlier declines in energy prices, we expect real PCE
growth to move up to a 3 percent pace in the current quarter, the same as in
our March Tealbook forecast. (See the box “Energy Prices and Consumer
Spending” for a related discussion.)
3 This depressed GDP growth in the first quarter continues the pattern observed in 2014 and 2015.
Although it is difficult to judge with any precision how much of this repeated weakness is due to
incomplete seasonal adjustment, the staff estimates that residual seasonality, which primarily affects data
for net exports and for state and local government construction spending, subtracted about ½ percentage
point from first-quarter GDP growth in 2016. Outside estimates of residual seasonality in the first quarter
span a fairly wide range, from essentially zero to a subtraction of more than 1½ percentage points. The
BEA’s initial estimate of GDP for the first quarter will be released the day after the FOMC meeting ends.
4 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q1 Real GDP Growth,” the
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at
0.8 percent, is about 1 percentage point lower than at the time of the March Tealbook; the staff’s
judgmental forecast is well within the range of nowcasts, which run from negative 0.5 percent to
1.9 percent.

Energy Prices and Consumer Spending
&
l
e
e
v
The drop in gasoline prices by nearly half since June 2014 resulted in households saving an
D
estimated $120 billion on gasoline expenditures over this period, or nearly $1,000 per household
n
o on average. In addition, the decline in oil prices has likely led to slightly lower prices of non‐
c
E energy goods, further boosting purchasing power. Traditional macroeconomic analyses
c
i suggest that these savings should have generated a material boost to real consumer spending.
t
s
e For example, using the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of income from one of the
m
o staff’s benchmark PCE models, this windfall gain implies a ¼ percentage point boost to real PCE
D
growth in 2015 and a similar contribution to growth this year.
Falling gasoline prices also appear to boost consumer sentiment, although the magnitude of the
effect may depend on households’ perceptions about the permanence of the decline.1
Expectations that a price decline is persistent could amplify its near‐term effects as some
households react immediately to anticipated future savings on gasoline. Indeed, we estimate
that much of the step‐up in sentiment in the Michigan survey since mid‐2014 was due to falling
gasoline prices, and that this sentiment channel contributed positively to PCE growth in 2015.
Combining the income and sentiment channels, we estimate that the direct effect of the decline
in energy prices since mid‐2014 (excluding the multiplier) added ½ percentage point to real PCE
growth in 2015 and will contribute an additional ¼ percentage point to growth in 2016.2
Although these estimates are on the low end of the estimates in the time‐series literature, those
studies are primarily informed by only a handful of large historical fluctuations in oil prices.3
Moreover, recent spending data have appeared weak relative to fundamentals, raising the
question as to whether even our estimates of the energy price effects might be too large.

2 Low energy prices may boost profits for firms that use energy and cut profits for energy producing firms,
affecting employment, dividend income, and wealth. We believe the net consumption response from these
channels is small.

To help shed light on how energy prices have affected aggregate consumption, the following O
figures contrast the actual evolution of real PCE and the saving rate since mid‐2014 (the solid &
l
black lines) with two hypothetical scenarios based on a staff model of PCE growth. One e
v
e
scenario (the red dotted line) shows a hypothetical path of real PCE assuming households saved D
all of the windfall from both lower energy prices and their pass‐through to core PCE prices. The n
o
other scenario (the dashed blue line) shows the trajectory of spending based on our estimate of c
E
the effect of falling energy prices on consumption from the table on the previous page. c
i
t
s
e
Based on these scenarios, the spending data since mid‐2014 might suggest that the drop in m
o
energy prices boosted household spending by less than we had estimated. However, PCE D
growth is somewhat volatile and subject to revision, and a larger spending response may have
been obscured by other factors.4 In fact, studies using microdata, such as a widely cited analysis
of household‐level credit card transaction data by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, conclude that
individuals may have spent a much larger portion of the windfall income, at least initially.5
Taken together, the macro and micro evidence suggest that households did spend out of the
windfall savings from falling energy prices. Thus, the fact that the saving rate has stepped up
since energy prices began to fall and consumer spending remains well below the level implied
by fundamentals suggest that factors not well captured in our models—such as precautionary
savings—may be holding down spending. We expect these precautionary motives to ease over
the medium term in response to continued improvements in the labor market. However, as we
think that most of the spending gains from falling energy prices have been realized already, we
expect only a modest additional boost in 2016 from this channel.

4 Beyond the general point that data are measured with error, there is also a specific measurement
problem associated with how the BEA’s methodology maps sales at retailers such as Costco into spending
categories that exclude gasoline. Because many of these retailers also sell gasoline, their nominal sales are
depressed when gasoline prices fall, leading BEA’s estimate of non‐gasoline retail sales to be biased downward.
We estimate this error cumulates to ¼ percentage point on the level of PCE since June 2014.

forecast—as data now suggest that spending on transportation and other
o
D
equipment contracted and outlays for drilling and mining structures plunged.
In the current quarter, we expect that spending on equipment and intangibles
will rise modestly—a view supported by recent improvements in forward-
looking indicators of business spending—but that drilling and mining
investment will fall further.
 We continue to expect that a mild correction in inventory investment will
subtract ¼ percentage point from GDP growth over the first half of this year,
though with the drag more concentrated in the first quarter. Specifically, the
data now suggest that inventory investment subtracted ½ percentage point
from real GDP growth in the first quarter, but we expect it to be a nearly
neutral influence on GDP growth in the second quarter.
 Net exports are estimated to have held down real GDP growth nearly
¾ percentage point in the first quarter as the strong run-up in the dollar from
the middle of 2014 through the end of last year continued to weigh on exports.
In the current quarter, we expect the drag from net exports to diminish to
about ½ percentage point, as exports begin increasing again—albeit only at a
tepid 1½ percent rate—and import growth continues at about a 4 percent pace.
Although we continue to project net exports will subtract from GDP growth
over the forecast period, the lower path of the dollar relative to the March
Tealbook has led us to lessen the expected drag a touch.
 Industrial production decreased in the first quarter, as utilities and mining
output fell and manufacturing output was little changed. Looking forward, the
weakness in the energy sector will likely continue to weigh considerably on
the industrial sector. Nevertheless, we expect industrial production to rise
over the next few months, as manufacturing output picks up—consistent with
the recent improvement in both the national and regional new orders

Beyond the near term, real GDP is expected to expand faster than its potential, e

supported by a still-accommodative stance of monetary policy and by mildly n

term—from 2¾ percent in the second half of 2016 to 2½ percent in 2017 and 2 percent in t i
s
e
2018—as waning monetary policy accommodation and fading fiscal impetus outweigh a m
o
D
lessening drag from the effects of past dollar appreciation.
 The level of real GDP at the end of the forecast is slightly higher than in the
previous Tealbook, reflecting several partially offsetting factors. We expect
only a little of the recent softness in the spending data to be made up this year,
leading us to revise down GDP growth in 2016. However, as described
earlier, we revised down our forecast for the term premiums in Treasury
yields, lowering our projection for long-term interest rates and providing a
boost to GDP growth throughout the forecast.5 In addition, the lower dollar
and higher equity prices in this projection also support somewhat stronger
growth in 2016 and 2017.
 The box “Tealbook Forecast Errors: An Update through 2015” reviews the
recent errors in the staff’s forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
The March employment report was broadly in line with our projection and
indicated that the labor market has continued to strengthen.
 For the first quarter as a whole, nonfarm payroll employment averaged about
210,000 per month, the same as in our March forecast. We continue to project
job gains of about 200,000 per month in the current quarter.
5 We allowed this revision to the term premium to affect our forecast for real activity following
our usual rules of thumb for interest rate effects. We considered the possibility that the lower term
premium was driven by factors that had not already been incorporated into the projection, in which case
accounting for these factors would have offset some or all of the boost from the lower interest rates. In the
end, however, we thought it more likely that the factors driving the lower term premium, including
increased risk to the global growth outlook, had already been built into the projection.

&
l
e As was the case in 2013 and 2014, the most recent estimate of real GDP growth in
v
e
D 2015 is close to prior staff forecasts, but the unemployment rate is lower than the
n staff expected. Price inflation in 2015 is in line with staff forecasts made last spring
o
c but well below forecasts from the previous year. Here we present and discuss these
E
c recent forecast errors.

The gray bars in the left panel of figure 1 show the currently published Q4/Q4 percent
o
D changes in real GDP from 2012 to 2015; the blue squares show the forecasts for GDP
growth made in the April Tealbook one year prior, and the green triangles show the
forecast from the April Tealbook in the contemporaneous year. The whisker bands
around the squares and triangles demarcate 70 percent forecast-error bands, with
unusually large forecast errors represented by cases where the top of a gray bar falls
outside one of the whisker bands. Because the bars themselves represent the latest
revised data, the red dots show the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimate of
GDP growth for each year from mid-April of the subsequent year (known as the third
estimates), along with 70 percent bands computed from past revisions.
Staff errors in forecasting 2015 real GDP growth do not appear particularly large
compared with past staff forecast errors. Moreover, the red whisker bands show that
the current BEA estimates are prone to sizable revisions, making discussion of these
forecast errors tentative. Having said that, the prior-year forecast appears to have
been too high because of a greater-than-expected drag from net exports, likely
associated with the surprisingly large appreciation of the dollar exchange rate. Lower-
than-expected investment and personal consumption expenditures appear to have
contributed to the forecast error as well. Current estimates of real disposable personal
income are close to the year-ahead projections; consequently, the BEA’s current
estimate of the saving rate is higher than the staff anticipated.

As in earlier years, lower-than-expected GDP growth in 2015 was not accompanied by a O
weaker-than-expected labor market. As the right panel of figure 1 shows, the staff &
l
forecasts of the unemployment rate in 2015:Q4 were too high, continuing the pattern e
v
e
of one-sided errors in forecasts made since August 2011. However, the misses for 2015 D
were somewhat smaller than the unusually large misses observed for the previous t wo n
o
years. In addition, the prior-year forecast of monthly payroll employment gains in 2015 c
E
was very close to the published figure of 229,000 (which is still subject to revision).1 c
i
t
s
e
Figure 2 shows the same information for total and core PCE price inflation. Despite the m
o
downside surprises to the unemployment rate, the current-year forecasts (the green D
triangles) have been relatively accurate in recent years, particularly for core PCE price
inflation. The accuracy of the forecasts relative to the current estimates partially
reflects upward revisions to nonmarket prices in last summer’s annual revision that
brought core PCE price inflation in 2012 and 2013 up to be in line with staff forecasts
that initially appeared somewhat too high.
The staff made an unusually large error in its prior-year forecast of 2015 total PCE price
inflation, which was concentrated in the energy category and reflected the
unexpected plunge in crude oil prices. The error in forecasting 2015 core PCE price
inflation one year ahead was smaller, and, in part, reflects the surprisingly large dollar
appreciation restraining core goods price inflation. Non-energy, nonhousing services
prices were also lower than projected, likely pushed down by a variety of factors that
included the unexpected expiration of a temporary increase in Medicaid
reimbursement rates to doctors that held down administered medical service price
inflation in 2015. Some of these factors were idiosyncratic to the core PCE price index,
and the staff’s prior-year forecast of 2 percent core CPI inflation in 2015 (not shown)
proved accurate despite the unexpected appreciation of the dollar.
1 Looking at a broader set of Tealbook forecasts of the 2015:Q4 unemployment rate, the
eight forecasts made during 2014 ranged between 0.1 and 0.6 percentage point too high, with
the error from April 2014 shown in the chart at the high end of this range. For payrolls, these
eight prior-year forecasts were too low, by an average of 18,000 jobs per month, and ranged
from being too low (by 68,000 jobs per month) to too high (by 7,000 jobs per month).

 The unemployment rate edged up to 5.0 percent in March, whereas we had
O

l

v
e

 Given our current assessment of trend participation and the natural rate of
unemployment, we estimate that there is now essentially no slack left in the
labor market. In the current quarter, the projection puts the unemployment
rate slightly below our estimate of its natural rate, the participation rate at its
trend level, and the employment-to-population ratio a touch above its trend.
That said, we continue to view the share of employees working part time for
economic reasons as a little elevated.
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, or LMCI—a strictly mechanical
method of filtering the data—decreased again in March and has now declined
for each of the past three months. The model’s assessment is at odds with the
staff’s view that the recent rise in labor force participation and the strong pace
of job gains point to continued improvement in labor market conditions
despite little change in the unemployment rate in recent months.
 We revised down sharply our forecast for labor productivity in the near term.
As noted earlier, output gains have been disappointing. In addition, although
job gains in March came in as projected, business-sector hours surprised us to
the upside because of a larger-than-expected increase in the hours of workers
who are outside the scope of the payroll survey.6 We now expect that
productivity will be unchanged over the first half of this year, in contrast to
the 1¾ percent increase we projected in the March Tealbook.
We adjusted downward our estimates of structural productivity and potential
output in this projection. By the end of 2016, the level of structural productivity is

employed persons, farm workers, and unpaid family workers.

estimate of potential output.
The medium-term outlook for the labor market is slightly stronger than the March
Tealbook projection.
 We now project that the unemployment rate will fall to 4.2 percent by the end
of 2018, a touch below our forecast in the March Tealbook, consistent with
the slightly faster pace of growth of real GDP beyond the near term. This path
for the unemployment rate, which ends the medium-term forecast
0.8 percentage point below our estimate of the natural rate, corresponds to our
projection that GDP will be 1½ percent above our estimate of its potential
level at the end of 2018.
 We project that the participation rate will decline at a pace slightly slower
than its trend as cyclical improvements in the economy draw additional people
into the labor force.8 The participation rate falls from 62.9 percent in the
current quarter to 62.3 percent at the end of 2018, 0.2 percentage point above
its trend.
 Productivity growth is projected to be 1¼ percent per year in 2017 and 2018,
well above the experience of the past few years. See the box “Productivity
7 Specifically, because our surprises in this category of hours stretch back to 2014, we lowered the
growth rate of structural productivity roughly 0.2 percentage point per year, on average, in 2014, 2015, and
2016.
8 The trend participation rate declines 0.3 percentage point per year, driven by the aging of the
population and ongoing declines in participation for particular demographic groups.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Recent data on inflation have, on balance, been in line with our March Tealbook
projection and support our expectation that core PCE price inflation will step down in the
second quarter.
 Much of the acceleration in core PCE prices in the first quarter, to nearly
2 percent at an annual rate, reflected high readings in January for categories
from which we take little signal. Consistent with this view, the core PCE
price index decelerated in February, and, with CPI and PPI data in hand, we
estimate that it only edged up in March.9 Accordingly, we expect that core
PCE inflation will step down to 1½ percent in the current quarter—essentially
unrevised from the March Tealbook. Our monthly projection implies that the
12-month change in core PCE prices will be at 1.5 percent from March
through June.
 With the fall in energy prices now largely behind us, we expect total PCE
inflation to be 1¼ percent in the second quarter.
 Core import prices are expected to increase at a modest 1 percent annual rate
in the current quarter, ending a string of six consecutive quarterly declines, as
the recent depreciation of the dollar pushes up prices. We expect core import
price inflation to pick up to a 2¼ percent pace in the second half of this year
and then to average only 1 percent in 2017 and 2018, consistent with our
projection for foreign inflation, the dollar, and commodity prices.
9 The core CPI posted a relatively large increase of 0.3 percent for February, which we reported at
the March FOMC meeting, but the increase in the core PCE index in February turned out to be modest,
rounding to 0.1 percent, in part because nonmarket prices reversed a large share of the January increase.

O Alternative View: Productivity Acceleration Will Be More Gradual
&
In contrast to the staff’s baseline projection that business-sector labor productivity will grow, on
l
e
v average, 1¼ percent annually over the next three years, this discussion presents the view that
e
D
productivity growth will recover more slowly from its recent meager pace. Since 2011, productivity
n
o growth has averaged less than ½ percent per year, which represents a substantial slowdown
c
E relative to the 2 percent average between 1973 and 2007. Like most other forecasters, the staff did
c
i not anticipate this slowdown and has been repeatedly surprised by the disappointing productivity
t
s
e gains (figure 1). Although the importance of different explanations for the recent paltry pace of
m
o productivity growth is still being debated, some of the factors that are holding back productivity
D
improvements will likely persist for a while longer.
It is worth noting that the productivity slowdown is not unique to the United States but instead has
been experienced by most developed countries. Indeed, among OECD countries with available
data, 29 of 30 countries experienced a reduction in productivity gains after 2005, with productivity
growth 1¼ percentage points lower per year, on average, between 2005 and 2014 than during the
preceding 10-year period. The ubiquity of the productivity deceleration suggests that the
underlying forces are likely to be common as well.
One set of possible explanations for the productivity slowdown in the United States relates to the
lingering effects of the Great Recession. Most importantly, growth of capital stock has been
anemic in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and, as a result, capital deepening—historically an
important driver of productivity growth—has been unusually and persistently subdued (figure 2).
At the same time, the severe distress in the labor market has likely impeded the reallocation of
labor toward its most productive uses. Moreover, firm formation dropped precipitously during the
Great Recession and remained depressed thereafter, and this “missing generation” of firms may
have diminished growth in the productive capacity of the economy.1 Although the effects of these
factors should dissipate over time, the experience so far suggests that this process will be gradual.

According to a second set of explanations, the productivity slowdown actually preceded the Great &
l
Recession. Factors that resulted in unusually strong multifactor productivity growth in the 1990s— e
v
e
most notably, factors related to rapid advances in information and communication technologies— D
had run their course by the mid-2000s.2 Relatedly, falling job reallocation associated with declining n

business dynamism appears to be pushing down productivity growth in the post-2000 period as c

well.3 As a consequence of these influences, we might have entered a period of slow productivity c

growth over the past five years, it seems unlikely that all of these forces will swiftly disappear in
coming quarters. Moreover, since the mid-1980s, productivity appears to be countercyclical, and
thus one should expect below-trend productivity growth at this stage in the business cycle.
Therefore, it seems more likely that productivity will accelerate only gradually, moving up perhaps
½ percent in 2016, ¾ percent in 2017, and 1 percent in 2018. If so, the level of productivity at the
end of 2018 would be 1¼ percent lower than currently projected by the staff.
A downward adjustment to the productivity forecast would also potentially have important
implications for other aspects of the staff’s projection. If the lower productivity growth were
assumed to reduce consumers’ and investors’ expectations of income, this reduction would result
in weaker aggregate demand but would have little implication for the labor market forecast.
Alternatively, and more consistent with the experience of the past few years, this lower
productivity growth could coincide with real GDP growth similar to the staff’s current outlook for
aggregate demand, in which case lower productivity growth would lead to a faster-than-projected
improvement in labor market conditions (see the Risks and Uncertainty section for a model-based
perspective on possible macroeconomic outcomes). Moreover, equilibrium wage growth—
the sum of trend inflation and underlying productivity growth—would be lower by almost
½ percentage point per year, implying that even a modest step-up in wage growth could lead to
inflationary pressures.
Finally, it is worth considering the case in which productivity growth remains historically low for a
prolonged period of time. A protracted productivity slowdown would have much more serious
macroeconomic consequences, including continued downward pressure on the equilibrium real
interest rate, reduced incentives for labor force participation, rising fiscal imbalances, and slower
improvements in living standards.

NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2014, vol. 29, pp. 1–51.

Miranda (2016), “Changing Business Dynamism: Volatility of Shocks vs. Responsiveness to Shocks?” unpublished
paper, https://goo.gl/M50DvW.
4 Another possibility is that the productivity slowdown reflects measurement issues. However, existing
research has found little support for this hypothesis; see David M. Byrne, John G. Fernald, and Marshall B. Reinsdorf
(forthcoming), “Does the United States Have a Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings
Papers on Economic Activity.

 The Michigan survey measure of longer-run inflation expectations fell u
O
0.2 percentage point to 2.5 percent in the preliminary April release, matching &
l
the very low reading we had in hand at the time of the March Tealbook. e
v
e
Meanwhile, market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation D
n
have edged up somewhat but still remain at the low end of their historical o
c
E
range.
c
i
t
s
e
We project core PCE inflation to be 1.5 percent this year but to move gradually m
o
D
higher over the remainder of the projection period, reaching 1.8 percent in 2018.
 Waning restraint from energy and import price pass-through accounts for
nearly all of the rise in core inflation that we are projecting over the medium
term. Other influences on the inflation projection, including the projected
tightening of resource utilization over the medium term, are relatively small.
 Beyond the near term, both food and energy prices are projected to rise just a
little faster than core prices on average. As a result, total PCE price inflation
moves back up to the same rate as core inflation in 2017 and 2018.
 Compared with the March Tealbook, both overall and core PCE price inflation
are 0.1 percentage point higher in 2016, as the lower path for the dollar shows
through to higher import prices. Thereafter, the inflation forecast is
essentially unrevised. Revisions to the inflation projection since the
December 2015 Tealbook are also relatively small.
We have received little data on labor compensation since the March Tealbook.
 In the 12 months through March, average hourly earnings increased
2¼ percent, in line with our expectation. In the near term, we expect the
12-month change in this measure to edge up slightly to 2½ percent.
 We now estimate that business-sector compensation per hour rose at an annual
rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter and will increase 2¾ percent over the
year as a whole. We continue to expect that gains in hourly compensation
will move up further, to 3¼ percent, by 2018.

u t THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
O
&
l  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
e
v
e pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.
D
n The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a normal size by the end
o
c
E of 2021.
c
i
t
s
e  The federal funds rate rises further after 2018. With the economy running
m
o
D above its potential level and inflation having reached the Committee’s
2 percent objective, the federal funds rate reaches 4 percent in 2020 and 2021
and moves back toward its long-run value of 3¼ percent thereafter.
 The natural rate of unemployment remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP
growth reaches its long-run value of 1.9 percent in 2020.
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates further and
rises at an annual rate of 1½ percent in 2020 and 2021. The unemployment
rate is 4¼ percent in 2019 and then starts rising gradually toward its assumed
natural rate in subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up from 1.8 percent in 2018 to the Committee’s
long-run objective of 2 percent in 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
After a very weak economic performance abroad last year, we have been relieved
to see indicators pointing to a pickup in foreign real GDP growth, to 2¼ percent, in the
first quarter. We see foreign growth edging up over the rest of this year and next to a
near-trend pace. Outside of a slight upward revision in the first quarter, our outlook is
little changed—but even that is a welcome departure from several rounds of forecast
downgrades.
k
o
o
Much of the unexpectedly large rise in foreign growth during the first quarter was l
t
u
O
concentrated in Canada, which rebounded from a weak fourth quarter and has a heavy
&
weight in our aggregate for foreign GDP. Output in the euro area and emerging Asia e l
v
e
excluding China also picked up. And although indicators for Japan were disappointing, D
n
they nevertheless point to flat growth in the first quarter compared with a contraction in o
c
E
the fourth. To be sure, Chinese growth slowed—to 5.4 percent from 7 percent in the ’ l
t
n
I
previous quarter—but we had largely anticipated this decline. And March indicators for
China were more upbeat, supporting our view that a stimulus-induced rebound is
under way.
We see foreign growth moving up to 2½ percent in the second half of this year
and to 2¾ percent in 2017. Foreign growth should be supported by the improvement in
global financial market conditions after a turbulent start to the year and by
accommodative macroeconomic policies. In the emerging market economies (EMEs),
where financial markets were hit hard by the turmoil early this year, credit spreads have
narrowed, stock prices have risen, and net capital inflows have resumed.
The improved tone of financial markets and the recent pickup in growth makes us
more confident about our baseline forecast. Nevertheless, downside risks remain, which
Page 41 of 102

--- Page 45 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) April 20, 2016
are all the more worrisome in an environment where several major central banks may
have limited latitude to respond to adverse shocks:
• Expectations of a more accommodative U.S. monetary policy stance seem to
have helped quell market tensions recently, but an eventual U.S. tightening
could still roil markets.
• The continued opacity of Chinese exchange rate policy creates the potential
for renewed financial turmoil, especially if Chinese authorities reacted to a
sharp generalized appreciation of the dollar by allowing the RMB to
k
o
o depreciate significantly.
l
t
u
O • Also in China, large financial imbalances, exacerbated by recent credit
&
stimulus, could amplify an unexpected slowing of growth into a hard landing.
l
e
v
D e • A further fall in oil prices could intensify financial strains among oil
n
o producers.
c
E
l • U.K. voters might surprise market participants and us by opting to leave the
’
t
n
I European Union (EU), which could have disruptive effects. (See the box
“Effect of a U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union” and the alternative
scenario “Disorderly Brexit.”)
In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), headline inflation slipped into
negative territory in the first quarter, weighed down by past declines in energy prices.
We see inflation in the AFEs rising as domestic energy prices move back up and the
degree of economic slack diminishes. By the end of 2018, we project that inflation will
have reached 2 percent in Canada and the United Kingdom and 1½ percent in the euro
area. By contrast, in Japan, low inflation is still well entrenched in wage- and price-
setting behavior, and we expect inflation to only reach 1 percent. Throughout the AFEs,
weak inflationary pressures and the modest economic recovery should keep monetary
policy accommodative. The European Central Bank (ECB) eased policy further last
month (after the Tealbook closed), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to ease
further at its next meeting. The Bank of England is not expected to lift off until the
fourth quarter, and the Bank of Canada will likely not tighten policy until mid-2017.

By contrast, our EME inflation aggregate jumped in the first quarter, largely
reflecting a food-driven increase in inflation in China and increases in much of Latin
America. With inflationary pressures in other emerging Asian economies at bay, the
central banks of India, Indonesia, Singapore, and Taiwan loosened monetary policy to
support demand. Conversely, Colombia’s central bank raised its policy rate to fight
inflationary pressures.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
k
• Canada. Recent indicators, including retail sales and monthly GDP for o
o
l
t
January, suggest that real GDP growth rebounded to 2¾ percent in the first u
O
quarter after slumping late last year. The surge in growth was driven, in part, &
l
e
by a pickup in inventory investment that we expect to be temporary. We v
e
D
project that growth over the next three years will average 2 percent, up from n
o
c
0.5 percent in 2015, as investment recovers, exports are supported by past E
l
’
t
currency depreciation, monetary policy remains accommodative, and fiscal n
I
stimulus announced in the March federal budget is implemented.
• Euro Area. Recent indicators suggest that growth picked up from 1¼ percent
in the fourth quarter to 1¾ percent in the first, partly reflecting transitory
factors such as a recovery of retail sales from disruptions late last year
associated with the terrorist attack in Paris. Looking ahead, the ECB’s recent
expansion of asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations
should support growth, but the recent appreciation of the euro will partly
offset this boost. All told, we expect GDP to grow at a 2 percent rate in 2017
and 2018—unchanged from our March Tealbook projection, which had
already anticipated some ECB easing.
• United Kingdom. We assume that uncertainty around the vote to leave the
EU will weigh on U.K. growth in the first half of the year, despite some boost
from the weaker pound. We expect growth to average about 2 percent, down
from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Recent indicators, such as industrial
production, PMIs, and consumer confidence, are consistent with this loss in

Effect of a U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union
In a referendum scheduled for June 23, U.K. citizens will be asked to vote on the
following question: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European
Union or leave the European Union?”1 The latest polls have the outcome as a virtual
toss-up, with about 20 percent of voters still undecided. In our baseline forecast, we
assume voters will choose to remain in the European Union (EU). But the risk of exit
is material. This discussion assesses the potential consequences of a “leave” vote for
the U.K. economy as well as attendant spillovers.
If the leave vote succeeds, the U.K. government has pledged to notify the European
k
o Council of the country’s intention to leave the EU, thus beginning negotiations
o
l regarding future U.K.–EU relations. The Treaty of Lisbon sets a two-year negotiation
t
u
O period during which all EU laws still apply and the United Kingdom retains access to
& the single market. Many people expect that the complexity of negotiations will
e l require an extension of the two-year period that would require unanimous approval
v
e of the remaining EU member states.
D
n
o The key elements to be agreed upon are the terms of the United Kingdom’s access to
c
E
the single market and, given the dominant role of London in EU financial markets,
l
’
n t bank passporting rights (the ability to provide financial services in a different EU
I
country without a need to set up a subsidiary). Two models stand out as possible
frameworks: Norway, which has full access to the single market (with passporting
rights) but does not have influence on the EU legislative process; and Switzerland,
which, through a set of bilateral agreements with the EU, has limited access to the
single market that excludes, in particular, financial services and thus passporting
rights. Of note, once it is no longer in the EU, the United Kingdom would also need to
renegotiate its trade agreements with the rest of the world.
The economic, financial, and political consequences of a leave vote could be
significant for the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU, given their tight trade and
financial links. The United Kingdom exports 45 percent of its goods and services to EU
countries, and roughly 50 percent of its imports come from these countries. In
addition, London serves as the most important financial center in the EU, accounting
for almost 25 percent of all EU financial services income and roughly 40 percent of EU
financial services exports.
Although a leave vote would not immediately change the status of the United
Kingdom in the EU, uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations could be disruptive.
On the financial side, uncertainty about the future role of London in EU financial
markets could lead to stress in various markets. The pound sterling would likely come
under pressure, and gilt yields could move up because of higher risk premiums as
1 Her Majesty’s Government [United Kingdom] (2016), “EU Referendum: Questions and
Answers,” webpage (London: HM Government), https://www.eureferendum.gov.uk/q-and-a.

foreign investors exit the U.K. market. Some U.K. banks and firms could face liquidity
problems as nonresident foreign-currency-denominated deposits are pulled back. On
the real side, uncertainty may depress economic growth by inducing companies to
postpone investment and households to save more.
Spillovers would likely be apparent in other European countries. A leave vote could
lead to increased uncertainty about the future of European integration, which could
have global consequences. Capital outflows from Europe would weigh on peripheral
spreads and lead to depreciation of the euro and appreciation of safe-haven
currencies. Lower U.K. growth would negatively affect the rest of the EU through
financial spillovers and, to a lesser extent, trade. In particular, euro-area banks may
suffer from their large exposure (65 percent of Tier 1 capital) to the nonbank U.K. k
o
private sector. o
l
t
u
O
Two factors are likely to determine the severity of these effects on the U.K. economy &
and the magnitude of international spillovers. The first is whether U.K. and EU l
e
v
policymakers are committed to smooth negotiations that aim to preserve strong e
D
trade and financial links. The second factor relates to the adequacy of contingency
n
o
planning by the Bank of England (BOE)—and possibly by other European institutions, c
E
such as the European Central Bank—in the event of financial stress following a leave
l
’
t
vote. Recently, the BOE announced that it will hold additional liquidity auctions n
I
around the date of the referendum.
We envision two possible scenarios in the case of a leave vote. Our moderate
scenario assumes that negotiations, though difficult, will be relatively uncontentious
and financial stresses will remain contained. We judge that uncertainty would still
have a negative effect on the U.K. economy (1 to 1½ percent decline in the level of
GDP relative to baseline through 2018) but with limited spillover to the rest of the EU
(¼ to ½ percent decline in GDP). However, we can also envision a more adverse
scenario (further discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section) in which a leave vote
leads to heightened political tensions between the United Kingdom and the EU. In
such a case, concerns about the future of the European project could emerge and
undermine confidence in financial backstops for vulnerable peripheral euro-area
countries, triggering a sharp and persistent increase in financial distress. In this
scenario, we estimate that the U.K. economy would experience a much larger output
loss (2 to 2½ percent decline in GDP relative to baseline), with greater spillovers to the
EU (1 to 1½ percent decline in GDP) and material effects on the rest of the world.
We also see the long-term effect of a leave vote for the United Kingdom as negative.
The exact size of the negative effect will be determined by the specifics of the
withdrawal agreement. In particular, any new arrangement with the EU will likely
result in a reduction in trade for the United Kingdom, which could weigh on
productivity and thus lead to a permanent loss in GDP level.

momentum. Given our assumption that voters will choose to stay in the EU,
we have growth picking up later this year to 2½ percent and holding just
below that rate over the remainder of the forecast period.
• Japan. On the heels of a fourth-quarter decline in GDP, recent data have been
unexpectedly weak—industrial production plunged in February, and the
Tankan survey of business expectations was downbeat. Moreover, recent yen
appreciation should damp exports, disappointing spring wage negotiations

growth starting this quarter. Given weak growth and sliding inflation

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. Real GDP growth fell to 5.4 percent in the first quarter, largely in line
with our expectations, as China’s manufacturing sector slowed sharply and
services growth moderated. Despite the weak start to the year, near-term risks
have receded a bit as policymakers have signaled a somewhat easier policy
stance. Indeed, a pickup in credit and investment growth, which appears to be
contributing to a turnaround in the housing market, suggests that policy
accommodation in recent quarters has begun to feed through to the real
economy. We expect growth to pick up to about 7 percent in the current
quarter and next before declining gradually to 6 percent by 2018. Intervention
sales of dollars have declined of late, likely reflecting reduced selling pressure
on the Chinese renminbi.
• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP rose 3½ percent in the first
quarter, up from a 3 percent pace in the fourth. The step-up was concentrated

in Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan and was due to expansionary fiscal
policies as well as robust private investment. Throughout the region, recent
high-frequency indicators such as PMIs and industrial production suggest that
activity picked up late in the first quarter even as exports continued to
disappoint. Overall, as in the March Tealbook, we expect the region’s growth
to step up to 4 percent this year and beyond, supported by stronger domestic
demand and some firming of growth in the advanced economies.
• Mexico. Incoming data suggest that growth remained at a subdued 2¼
k
o
percent pace in the first quarter. U.S. demand for Mexican manufactured o
l
t
u
goods remained weak except for automotive exports, which grew briskly. The O
&
low price of oil has weighed on growth through tighter fiscal policies,
l
e
v
particularly cuts in public-sector investment. We see growth remaining e
D
subdued in the current quarter, restrained by weak U.S. manufacturing growth, n
o
c
before edging up to its trend pace of 3 percent by late 2018. Monetary policy E
l
’
t
continues to be accommodative, and both the large depreciation of the peso n
I
and past economic reforms should provide some impetus to growth.
• Brazil. Policy paralysis amid the political crisis continued to drag down
activity, with real GDP estimated to have declined by 3 percent in the first
quarter. Consumer and business confidence have been stuck at very low
levels, and industrial output continued to plunge. Activity is being further
depressed by the central bank’s tight monetary policy stance to combat high
inflation, which registered 9.4 percent on a 12-month basis in March. On
April 17, the House of Deputies voted to recommend that President Dilma
Rousseff be impeached. The impeachment process now moves to the Senate,
which is expected to vote in mid-May to start the impeachment trial. Once
this step is taken, President Rousseff will need to step aside and Vice
President Michel Temer will likely become the interim president. The trial
could take several months. Amid such an unsettled political environment, we
do not see Brazil returning to positive growth until 2017 and even then expect
only a very slow recovery.

Financial Developments
Financial market conditions improved further, on balance, over the intermeeting
period, with investors appearing to respond to Federal Reserve communications that were
viewed as more accommodative than expected and somewhat better incoming data on
foreign economic activity. Risk sentiment appeared to improve further, on net,
accompanied by a decline in financial market volatility and higher oil prices. Domestic
economic data releases over the period had, on balance, a limited effect on asset prices.
 According to a straight read of futures contracts, the path of the federal funds
rate flattened significantly, with the rate at the end of 2017 down about
23 basis points, and the odds placed on an increase in the federal funds rate at
the June meeting were reduced further. In the Open Market Desk’s surveys of
primary dealers and market participants, the median dealer’s modal policy
path was little changed, while the median investor’s modal path moved down
substantially.
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal securities declined between about
19 basis points and 25 basis points, while market-based measures of longer-
term inflation compensation increased modestly but remained low. s

reportedly diminished.1
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations appeared to ease somewhat
relative to earlier this year: Bond issuance by speculative-grade firms
rebounded and CMBS spreads narrowed markedly, although they remain
elevated.
 Recent patterns of household financing conditions continued: Mortgage
markets remained tight for lower-quality borrowers, while consumer credit
markets stayed accommodative.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
Federal Reserve communications accompanying the March FOMC meeting were
interpreted by market participants as more accommodative than expected. In particular,
investors were attentive to the larger-than-expected downward revision to the projected
path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections and to references
to risks to the U.S economic outlook stemming from global economic and financial
developments. Subsequently, Chair Yellen’s remarks to the Economic Club of New
York on March 29 appeared to reinforce market expectations of a gradual pace of policy
rate increases. Meanwhile, domestic data releases came in mixed and elicited only a t s
n
e
modest market reaction. m

and market participants gave somewhat conflicting results. Whereas the median dealer’s
modal policy path was little changed, the median investor’s modal path moved down
substantially. Consistent with this divergence, the median investor also pushed out the

most likely timing of a change to the Committee’s policy on reinvestments by about a
quarter.
Nominal Treasury yields decreased noticeably since the March FOMC meeting.
On net, yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities moved down 21, 25, and
19 basis points, respectively.2 According to staff models, the decline in medium- and
longer-term Treasury yields reflected declines in both the expected policy path and term
premiums. The 5-year inflation compensation based on TIPS was about unchanged, and
5-to-10-year inflation compensation increased modestly but remained at low levels.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Since the March FOMC meeting, global financial market conditions have eased
modestly. Overall risk sentiment appears to have improved, with expectations of more
accommodative monetary policy in the United States playing a role. Sentiment was also
boosted by foreign data suggesting growth picked up in the first quarter, somewhat
alleviating market fears of a sharp slowdown in global growth.
Along with U.S. interest rates, AFE sovereign yields declined notably following
the March FOMC meeting and the speech by Chair Yellen in late March. Over the
period, 10-year sovereign yields declined 15 basis points in Germany, 3 basis points in
s
the United Kingdom, and 11 basis points in Japan, reaching near all-time lows in these n t
e
m
countries. After a slight rebound earlier this year, 5-to-10-year inflation compensation

The broad dollar depreciated 2¾ percent, including 3¼ percent against AFE

the weakening. First, the dollar moved down noticeably on days when U.S. policy n

expectations shifted, importantly after the FOMC meeting and the Chair’s speech. In
addition, upward moves in the price of oil appeared to support commodity currencies.
The British pound appreciated less than most other AFE currencies, reflecting concerns

attribute this development to technical factors, such as the covering of short positions,
which put upward pressure on the yen.
The demand for dollar funding by financial institutions remained elevated, which
was apparent in the “dollar funding premium,” the additional cost of obtaining dollar
funding via the foreign exchange swap market relative to the cost of direct dollar funding.
(For more discussion on the dollar funding premium, see the box “Recent Developments
in Offshore Dollar Funding Markets.”)
Over the intermeeting period, foreign equity market performance was generally
positive. AFE broad equity indexes were up slightly, although bank stocks continued to
underperform. Supported by expectations of more accommodative U.S. monetary policy
and higher oil prices, EME equities gained about 4 percent, EME sovereign spreads
narrowed on net, and money flowed into EME funds.
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS
Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. equity price indexes moved up, on net,
likely owing to more-accommodative-than-expected monetary policy and an
improvement in risk sentiment. Stock prices increased across all industries, including the
energy sector. One-month-ahead implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—

With earnings reports of roughly 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 index
on hand and a straight read of Wall Street equity analysts’ forecasts for the rest, corporate
earnings in the first quarter are projected to have decreased about 7 percent relative to the
previous quarter. The staff expects that, following typical patterns, most actual reports
will beat Wall Street analysts’ forecasts—as appears to be the case so far—and the
decline in earnings will likely be more modest. In addition, Wall Street analysts

Recent Developments in Offshore Dollar Funding Markets
Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the cost of dollar funding by directly borrowing dollars has
differed significantly from funding by indirectly borrowing another currency and using a foreign
exchange (FX) swap to convert those funds into dollars. In theory, these differences in dollar
funding costs should be small, as wide spreads between the two rates create arbitrage
opportunities that make it profitable to engage in transactions that would tend to close the gap.
This discussion examines possible causes for the rise in differences in dollar funding costs and
offers a possible explanation for the recent divergence in these measures across currencies.
Although large dollar funding gaps were often viewed as a sign of funding distress in the past, the
recent rise in these gaps likely reflects other factors, particularly the combination of increased
financial intermediation costs after the GFC and divergent monetary policy stances between the
Fed and foreign central banks in recent years.
Dollar funding gaps used to be small. As shown in figures 1 and 2, the dollar funding premium,
which is the cost of funding via the FX swap market minus the cost of funding directly, was close
to zero before 2007. During the GFC, the dollar funding premium spiked, reflecting the acute
global shortages of dollar liquidity and, more generally, the disorder in global financial markets.
Even after more orderly financial conditions returned, the funding premium has remained wider
and considerably more variable.
In addition, dollar funding premiums now differ remarkably based on the currency involved. The
recent increases in premiums have been especially pronounced for the euro and yen at both

short and long maturities. Short-term premiums are important for banks when transforming
funding across currencies, whereas long-term premiums are particularly relevant for corporate
issuers and investors of long-dated securities when hedging long-term currency risk. The five-
year premium vis-à-vis the yen is currently about 90 basis points, near its historical high, and the
five-year premium vis-à-vis the euro is about 40 basis points, close to the level observed during
the GFC’s peak. In contrast, the recent rise in the premium vis-à-vis the British pound has been
much more subdued.
Rather than reflecting severe offshore dollar funding distress, the recent increase in dollar
funding premiums more likely reflects two other factors. First, balance sheet constraints faced by
global banks, in part as a result of regulatory reforms since the GFC, could be weakening market
making and arbitrage mechanisms that ensured near-zero dollar funding premiums before the
crisis. Even under normal financial market conditions, tighter regulations have likely increased
the return that banks require to provide FX swap liquidity and to directly engage in activities that
narrow variations in dollar funding costs.
Second, in the presence of costly financial intermediation after the crisis, divergent monetary
policy stances have likely contributed to the recent increase in dollar funding premiums. Figure 3
shows policy expectations in the United States started diverging from those in the euro area and
Japan in 2013 and 2014 but remained close to those in the United Kingdom. The persistently low-
or negative-yield environment in Europe and Japan in recent years and the ample liquidity in
euros and yen supplied through unconventional monetary policies have likely increased the
imbalance between the demand for dollar-denominated assets and the supply of euro- and yen-
denominated liabilities.1 Consistent with this narrative, figures 4 and 5 show, respectively, strong
demand from foreign investors for U.S. corporate debt and strong issuance by U.S. firms in
foreign currencies starting in 2013. To offset the imbalance between the strong demand for
dollar-denominated assets and the strong supply of foreign currency funding, financial
s
t
intermediaries demand more dollar funding via the FX swap market, exerting upward pressure on n
e
dollar funding premiums vis-à-vis the euro and the yen. The relatively similar monetary policy m
p
stances in the United States and the United Kingdom help explain the much smaller magnitude of o
l
the premium vis-à-vis the pound. e

The Level of U.S. Corporate Bond Yield Spreads
Even though corporate bond spreads narrowed notably in late February and March, their levels
remained very elevated and are currently around the 75th percentile of their historical
distributions (figure 1). These elevated spreads are consistent with the deterioration in the
energy sector, heightened risk aversion, and increased concerns on the outlook for credit
defaults, all of which contribute to tightness in financing conditions for the corporate sector and
may warn of some sluggishness in economic activity going forward.1
The sharp drop in the price of oil since mid-2014 has substantially threatened the prospects, and
in some cases the viability, of many firms involved in the exploration and production of fossil
fuels. Over this period, spreads for investment- and speculative-grade bonds of these firms have
widened substantially to levels not seen since the Great Recession (figure 2). However, spreads
have also widened outside the energy sector, although by considerably less, indicating that
factors specific to this sector cannot entirely account for the overall high level of spreads.
Estimated risk premiums in bond spreads also have increased since mid-2014 (figure 3). The
increase is consistent with both investors’ perception of higher economic uncertainty and less
willingness to hold risky securities. However, near-term forward spreads on speculative-grade
bonds, which are interpreted as an indicator of factors such as the near-term credit outlook, have
widened more than far-term spreads have, which is interpreted more as an indicator of investors’
appetite to bear credit risk (figure 4). This divergence suggests that an increase in expected
credit losses for the broad market accounts for some of the increase in corporate bond spreads.

1 Some studies find that corporate bond spreads tend to increase before recessions (for example, Mark
Gertler and Cara Lown (1999), “The Information in the High-Yield Bond Spread for the Business Cycle: Evidence
and Some Implications,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 15 (Autumn), pp. 132–50) and have significant
predictive power for economic activity (see, for example, Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek (2012), “Credit
Spreads and Business Cycle Fluctuations,” American Economic Review, vol. 102 (4), pp. 1692–720). Other studies
point out that spreads frequently increase even outside recession periods (for example, James Stock and Mark
Watson (2003), “Forecasting Output and Inflation: The Role of Asset Prices,” Journal of Economic Literature,
vol. 41 (3), pp. 788–829), such as during the Long-Term Capital Management and the European debt crises. In the
March 2016 memo to the FOMC titled “Probability of Recession Implied by Credit Market Sentiment,” Giovanni
Favara, Kurt Lewis, and Gustavo Suarez document and evaluate the significant predictive power of an investor
sentiment measure extracted from bond spreads.

Information from nonfinancial corporations’ financial reports are consistent with a potential
weakening in credit performance. After trending up for several years, the aggregate ratio of debt
to total assets for the corporate sector is at its highest level in more than two decades (figure 5).
In recent quarters, growth in corporate earnings has slowed and credit quality downgrades have
significantly outpaced upgrades. Last quarter, corporate defaults neared six-year highs, with
about half of the defaulted principal accounted for by energy and commodities industry debt.
These developments suggest increased vulnerability of the corporate sector in the near term, as
reflected in current estimates of expected defaults.2 However, these estimates remain low
relative to the historical average, and a few additional factors mitigate the level of concern
(figure 6). Aggregate cash holdings remain high, interest expenses remain low by historical
standards, and reliance on short-term debt by U.S. corporations remains low in the aggregate.
Finally, although we cannot rule out that concerns about market liquidity risks may also have
contributed to the widening of bond spreads, traditional measures of market liquidity, such as
trading volume and bid-asked spreads have not signaled a significant worsening of liquidity in
recent years.3

2 Similar vulnerabilities are discussed in the March 2016 Tealbook (see the box “Recent Developments in
Speculative-Grade Corporate Debt Markets” in Tealbook A).
3 Available liquidity indicators are based on executed trades, as most trading is over the counter with no
centralized mechanism to collect trade orders. The stability in recent years of these indicators contrasts with the
view, shared by a wide range of market participants, of a deterioration of liquidity in credit markets. However, no
evidence is available to suggest that the perceived deterioration accounts for the widening of spreads since 2014.

continued to revise down their forecasts for year-ahead earnings through mid-April, even
beyond the energy sector, although the downward revisions were much smaller than in
prior months.
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE
Overall, financing conditions for U.S. nonfinancial businesses remained generally
accommodative for investment-grade issuers, and those for speculative-grade firms
improved somewhat after having shown strains earlier in the year. Corporate bond
issuance for speculative-grade firms rebounded in March from the sluggish pace in
January and February. While initial public equity offerings remained anemic in the first
quarter, early indications suggest that stock repurchases and M&A activity stayed robust.
Growth of C&I loans on banks’ books remained strong and continued to be driven
by lending at large banks making loans to investment-grade borrowers. Nonetheless,
according to the most recent SLOOS, on balance during the first quarter, banks further
tightened their lending standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, while
demand for such loans weakened. Banks mainly pointed to a less favorable economic
outlook and a worsening of conditions in the energy sector in explaining the tightening in
lending standards last quarter; customers’ reduced needs for financing fixed investments
and merger activity were cited as the drivers of weaker demand.

Turning to the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, a significant number of
SLOOS respondents reported tightening their lending standards on all major categories of
these loans during the first quarter, following a moderate number that reported doing so
in the fourth quarter and after several years of easing. Banks also reportedly tightened
several loan terms over the past year and pointed to the outlook for vacancy rates,
capitalization rates, and property prices, as well as a reduced tolerance for risk, by way of
explanation. However, demand for CRE loans reportedly strengthened, and CRE loans

on banks’ books continued to grow at a robust pace over the first quarter. In response to
wider and more volatile CMBS spreads at the beginning of the year, CMBS issuance has
been subdued in the first quarter, consistent with reports from banks in the SLOOS. Over
the intermeeting period, CMBS spreads narrowed markedly but remained at elevated
levels.
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets continued to be stable, even as the
situation facing Puerto Rico’s creditors deteriorated further. Gross issuance of municipal
bonds remained solid in the first quarter, and yield spreads on general obligation (GO)
municipal bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed, on
net, over the intermeeting period. A default by Puerto Rico on a wider range of debt,
including its GO bonds, remains likely in the absence of a restructuring agreement with
investors or congressional intervention. Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank
has a substantial debt payment due in early May, and the next sizable payment of GO
bonds is due in July. In addition, the Puerto Rican legislature passed a bill allowing the
governor to declare a moratorium on debt payments. However, market participants
reportedly consider the risks of broader spillovers from a possible default to be low.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Growth of residential real estate (RRE) loans on banks’ books remained subdued
s

through the first quarter, and credit conditions stayed tight for mortgage borrowers with n

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed and
remained largely accommodative, with student and auto loans continuing to be broadly
available and credit card lending conditions relatively tight, particularly for borrowers
with subprime credit scores. Moreover, responses to the SLOOS indicate that during the
first quarter, while credit card lending standards were little changed, a modest number of
banks reported easing lending standards on auto and other consumer loans. Over the
same period, demand for auto loans reportedly further strengthened at many banks.

Consumer loan balances continued to increase at a robust pace through February, and
data on bank lending activities suggest further growth through March. Issuance of ABS
continued to be robust in the first quarter, with their spreads stabilizing at levels that
remained a bit higher than usual.
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS
Growth of core loans and deposits at commercial banks stayed robust during the
first quarter. Over the intermeeting period, the largest banks reported declines in
profitability during the first quarter due to reduced trading and investment banking
revenues and low net interest margins. However, for several banks, these declines in
profitability were in line with or slightly better than analysts’ consensus expectations.
Stock prices of bank holding companies underperformed broad equity market indexes but
edged higher on banks’ earnings reports later in the period, while banks’ CDS spreads
remained elevated.
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Over the intermeeting period, take-up in overnight reverse repurchase agreement
(ON RRP) operations continued to be well below average levels in 2015 and strikingly
below the median dealer estimate of ON RRP take-up after liftoff in the Desk’s
s
December Survey of Primary Dealers. The elevated triparty Treasury repo volumes, t

combined with the high Treasury bill issuance, likely depressed take-up. Low take-up m

Developments regarding the Implementation
of Money Market Fund Reforms
In July 2014, the SEC adopted changes in the rules that govern the operation of money market
funds (MMFs). The key reforms include requiring floating net asset values (NAVs) for prime
institutional funds and tax‐exempt institutional funds and mandating that all prime and tax‐
exempt funds have the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates when their liquid
assets fall below specified thresholds. These new rules go into effect in October 2016.1
In response, fund complexes have announced or completed changes that will, on net, reduce
prime fund assets under management (AUM) by about $300 billion—approximately 20 percent of
the prime fund industry. These changes mostly reflect conversions of prime funds to
government‐only funds, which allow funds to avoid the gates‐and‐fees and floating NAV
requirements. Moreover, some funds have been closed or have left the MMF sector, and others
may still be waiting to announce a conversion. In addition, prime funds with about $100 billion in
assets have completed conversions from institutional to retail funds, which allows them to avoid
the floating NAV requirement.2
The implementation of the new rules could raise a number of issues for markets and
policymakers. First, large moves from prime to government funds require a shift in assets from
private securities to U.S. government securities and government repurchase agreements, and
these changes could affect credit spreads for money market instruments. Funds that have
completed conversions to government funds have eliminated their holdings of private
instruments, including commercial paper and certificates of deposit, and increased their holdings
s of Agency debt (figure 1). Partly in preparation for this shift, over the past year, prime funds in

1 A number of new regulations, also announced in July 2014, will take effect later this month. These
regulations include additional rules on asset diversification, enhanced disclosure of information allowing investors
to assess risks, and enhancements of the stress‐testing requirements adopted by the SEC in 2010.
2 Under the SEC’s Investment Company Act Rule 2a‐7, as amended, retail MMFs are funds that have “policies
and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners of the fund to natural persons”
(https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2014/33‐9616‐rule‐2a‐7‐amendments.pdf). Institutional funds are not subject to
such a restriction and may be held primarily by institutional investors. The SEC imposed the floating NAV
requirement only on institutional funds because, historically, institutional investors have been far more likely than
retail investors to redeem MMF shares during episodes of stress.

aggregate have substantially reduced their holdings of private instruments with more than 30
days to maturity. Overall, money funds managed these sizable shifts by reallocating assets very
gradually over a period of several months and, as a result, it is difficult to identify any price
effects.
Second, the implementation of MMF reforms could drive investors away from prime MMFs,
which could be disruptive for short‐ term funding markets. Although, to date, investors have not
moved away from prime MMFs (see the blue hashed portions of the bars in figure 2), large and
disruptive outflows from institutional prime funds could occur ahead of the October deadline,
particularly if institutional investors want to avoid floating NAVs, gates, and fees. As a reported
precaution against such redemptions, fund managers have increased, in aggregate, their holdings
of liquid assets.
Third, the shift in assets from prime MMFs to government MMFs could boost take ‐up at the
overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility because government funds typically
invest larger shares of their assets in ON RRPs than do prime funds. That said, we have not
observed signs of increased take ‐up at the facility in response to the conversions. In fact, the
average daily take ‐up by government MMFs has remained under $35 billion over the intermeeting
period. As regards ON RRP participation at quarter‐ ends, when prime MMFs tend to place a large
amount of their assets in the Fed’s facility, the reduction in the AUM of prime MMFs could damp
ON RRP participation spikes.
Fourth, the reduction in the AUM of prime MMFs should have a net positive effect on financial t
s
n
stability, as prime funds are particularly vulnerable to runs. However, the net effect depends on e
m
what happens to the assets previously held by prime funds and how investors—particularly p
o
institutional investors who have used prime funds for cash management—move their balances. e l
v
e
D
So far, the money fund industry, and money markets more generally, appears to be adjusting
l
a
relatively smoothly to the new rules. However, given that the adjustment is ongoing, the staff i

n
will continue to monitor both the transition and the efficacy of the SEC’s reforms. a

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth,
the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in line with the average over the past
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC). We have maintained our assumption that
the risks to our GDP projection are tilted to the downside, in part because we view
neither monetary nor fiscal policy as well positioned to offset large adverse shocks. In
addition, while there has recently been some improvement in global financial and
economic conditions, downside risks emanating from abroad remain. We view the risks
around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore,
as skewed to the upside. We continue to see the risks around our inflation projection as
weighted to the downside. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain
low, and some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are at the low
ends of their historical ranges.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities of the U.S.
financial system as moderate overall. This assessment is due importantly to high capital
positions at banks and insurance companies, sizable holdings of liquid assets at large
banks, and below-trend leverage for the household sector. That said, valuation pressures
have increased in equity markets and commercial real estate in absolute terms, although
such pressures are less apparent when judged relative to the low level of Treasury yields.
Moreover, nonfinancial corporate firms’ leverage is elevated; although these corporations
are not expected to face debt repayment difficulties in the near term, given their expected
profits and the low interest rates, elevated leverage leaves these firms vulnerable to
distress should profits unexpectedly weaken.

premiums on long-duration Treasury securities slows economic growth. The fourth
scenario considers the implications of long-term inflation expectations that are lower than
in the baseline. In the fifth scenario, a U.K. exit from the European Union (EU) leads to
increases in financial stress and an appreciation of the dollar. The final scenario
considers the possibility that stronger growth abroad causes the dollar to depreciate
substantially relative to the baseline.
We illustrate the first two scenarios using the Board staff’s EDO model. The next
two scenarios are generated using the FRB/US model, and the last two scenarios use the
multicountry SIGMA model. In each of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is
governed—as in the baseline forecast— by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1
In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their
baseline paths.
Weaker Labor Productivity, Weaker Labor Market
Labor productivity growth has been weak over the past several years, averaging
less than ½ percent per year from 2011 through 2015. In the baseline projection,
productivity growth is assumed to pick up to an average annual rate of 1¼ percent in
2017 and 2018. However, as presented in the box “Alternative View: Productivity
Acceleration Will Be More Gradual” in the Domestic Economic Developments and
Outlook section, the forces that have contributed to subdued productivity growth over the
past several years may abate more slowly than is assumed in the baseline. In this
scenario and the next, the path of labor productivity is assumed to be the same as the one
considered in the alternative view box: Labor productivity increases ½ percent in 2016,
¾ percent in 2017, and 1 percent in 2018. The growth rate of labor productivity remains
at 1 percent in 2019 and 2020 and gradually converges to the baseline path thereafter.
In this scenario, the lower path of labor productivity is driven solely by reduced
total factor productivity. With a slower growth rate of total factor productivity, real GDP
grows more slowly than in the baseline, averaging about 1½ percent per year over the
next five years. The bad news about future productivity causes a slight deterioration in

aggregate demand; accordingly, the unemployment rate follows a trajectory that is a bit
higher than the baseline path. Lower total factor productivity increases firms’ marginal
costs of production, leading to inflation that rises a little more quickly than in the baseline
and reaches 2 percent in late 2018. The path for the federal funds rate is essentially
unchanged from the baseline, as the effect of a slightly higher path for the unemployment
rate is offset by mildly higher inflation.
Weaker Labor Productivity, Stronger Labor Market
It is difficult to gauge all of the underlying sources behind weak labor
productivity growth in recent years, and this scenario presents an alternative set of
economic forces with different implications for key macroeconomic outcomes. In this
scenario, the lower path of labor productivity is driven by a combination of lower total
factor productivity growth and stronger aggregate demand, similar to the staff’s
interpretation of the past several years.2 Real GDP and employment rise faster than in the
first scenario, at rates that are more in line with the average paces seen since 2014. The
unemployment rate declines more rapidly than in the baseline, reaching a low point of
3¾ percent in 2019. With resource utilization tighter in this scenario, the path for core
PCE price inflation is higher than in the baseline and in the first scenario. Core PCE
price inflation peaks at 2¼ percent in late 2018. Reflecting both the lower unemployment
rate and higher inflation, the federal funds rate rises faster than in the baseline and
reaches 5¼ percent by the end of 2020.
Sharp Increases in Term Premiums
Measures of the term premiums on long-maturity Treasury securities have
recently fallen further into negative territory. In the baseline projection, these term
premiums are expected to increase gradually from their current levels to positive long-run
average values. However, as noted in the “QS Assessment of Financial Stability,” the
rise in term premiums could be abrupt. In this scenario, we consider the possibility that
term premiums on 5-year and 10-year Treasury securities rise more than 200 basis points
in one year and that term premiums on 30-year Treasury securities rise 165 basis points.

tightening overall financial conditions and thus exerting downward pressure on
household consumption and business activity. Real GDP grows 1½ percent per year
from 2016 through 2018, ½ percentage point below the baseline. The unemployment rate
remains near 5 percent over the next five years. The path for inflation is a touch lower
than in the baseline and reaches just under 2 percent at the end of 2020. Even though
long-term Treasury yields are higher than in the baseline, the federal funds rate is lower,
reflecting the weaker economic conditions. The federal funds rate rises to only 3 percent
by late 2020.
The adverse effects of a sharp increase in term premiums could plausibly be either
smaller or larger than described in this scenario. For example, in implementing this
scenario, we assume that the sharp increases in term premiums and the associated rises in
yields will not cause widespread financial stress or disrupt the financial system and that
their effects on economic activity will only come through the usual interest rate channels.
If that assumption turned out to be wrong, the negative effects on economic conditions
could be worse than those shown in this scenario. Alternatively, if term premiums have
become more negative recently as a result of increased uncertainty about the economic
outlook and some of the increases in term premiums are driven by the unwinding of such
uncertainty effects, this unwinding could mitigate some of the adverse effects of the
increases in term premiums described in this scenario.
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations
In the baseline projection, PCE price inflation is projected to increase gradually to
the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent. A key assumption behind this
projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for wage and price
setting is currently consistent with PCE price inflation of 1¾ percent, and that
expectations will eventually rise to a level consistent with 2 percent inflation. However,
a wide range of uncertainty surrounds this assumption, and some measures of longer-run
inflation expectations are currently near the low ends of their historical ranges. In this
scenario, we assume that long-term inflation expectations currently stand at 1.5 percent
and that, going forward, households and businesses form their expectations adaptively

Core PCE price inflation is lower than in the baseline, reaching its trough of
1.3 percent in early 2017, as subdued inflation expectations and low actual inflation are
mutually reinforcing. Thereafter, core inflation rises gradually, reaching 1¾ percent in
2020. The path of the federal funds rate is lower than in the baseline, while the paths of
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged. However, the
effect of low inflation on the real economy could be adverse if, for example, there was a
pronounced debt-deflation dynamic.
Disorderly Brexit
Although our baseline assumes that the U.K. electorate will vote to stay in the EU
in the June 23 referendum, this outcome is far from assured. In this scenario, we assume
that the United Kingdom opts to leave the EU and that subsequent negotiations on new
trade and financial arrangements between U.K. and EU authorities prove contentious.4
U.K. household and business confidence deteriorates markedly, and financial conditions
tighten sharply. Moreover, concerns about the future of European integration also cause
a persistent worsening of European financial conditions. All told, EU GDP falls around
1¼ percent below baseline, with an even sharper decline in the United Kingdom, while
flight-to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar to appreciate about 5 percent.
The stronger dollar and some tightening of U.S. financial conditions cause U.S.
real GDP growth to moderate to about 1¾ percent in 2016 and 2 percent in 2017. The
U.S. unemployment rate falls less than in the baseline. Weaker economic activity and
falling import prices reduce U.S. core inflation to 1¼ percent in 2016 and 2017. The
federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline and is about 2¾ percent at
the end of 2018.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar
In our baseline forecast, the substantial downside risks facing the foreign
economies diminish only gradually as foreign output growth picks up modestly and
inflation slowly moves closer to central bank targets. However, a number of factors—
y
risks to future inflation are tilted to the downside. The lower-bound constraint on interest rates naturally t
n
tilts inflation risk to the downside and thus can depress long-term inflation expectations. See Timothy a i
t
Hills, Taisuke Nakata, and Sebastian Schmidt (2016), “The Risky Steady State and the Interest Rate Lower e r
c
Bound,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-009 (Washington: Board of Governors of the n

including highly accommodative foreign monetary policies, fiscal stimulus in some
EMEs, and the unleashing of pent-up demand as financial conditions continue to
improve— could spur a stronger recovery abroad than we are currently projecting. In this
scenario, we assume that foreign GDP improves at a moderately faster pace than in our
baseline so that the level of foreign output runs 1 percent above the baseline by early
2018. Increased optimism about the foreign recovery and the perception of diminished
tail risks cause the broad real dollar to depreciate 8 percent by the end of next year,
reversing about half of the appreciation that has occurred since the middle of 2014.
The weaker dollar and somewhat stronger foreign growth boost U.S. real net
exports. Consequently, U.S. real GDP expands 2¾ percent in 2017, nearly ½ percentage
point more than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate falls to 3¾ percent by the end
of 2018. Higher import prices and resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to reach
2 percent by late 2017. The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the baseline,
reaching almost 4 percent by the end of 2018.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that yy

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
