Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

v
e
Incoming data indicate that the economy is expanding at a moderate rate. Real D
n
GDP growth appears to have picked up from its weak first-half pace, as the drag from o
c
E
inventory investment has ended and growth in private domestic final purchases (PDFP)
c
i
t
has remained solid. The estimated rate of GDP growth in the second half—at an annual s
e
m
rate of 2½ percent—is a bit higher than in the October Tealbook, mainly reflecting o
D
somewhat stronger incoming data on consumer spending, residential investment, and net
exports. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have tightened further: Payrolls have
continued to post solid gains, and the unemployment rate is estimated to have fallen to
4.6 percent in November. Overall, we now view the economy as operating a touch above
its sustainable level, a slightly stronger assessment than in the previous Tealbook.
Over the medium term, the main change to the forecast stems from our
assumptions about fiscal policy. While there is substantial uncertainty about the size and
composition of any potential fiscal changes that may be enacted in coming years, in our
view the modal outlook for fiscal policy has shifted toward a more expansionary stance.
As a placeholder pending further details, the forecast assumes a persistent cut in personal
income taxes equivalent to 1 percent of GDP beginning in the third quarter of 2017. The
assumed fiscal stimulus is partially offset by the reaction of financial markets and
monetary policy to that stimulus, resulting in a net boost to the level of real GDP of about
½ percent at the end of 2019. The Risks and Uncertainty section illustrates the
consequences of either no additional fiscal stimulus or of a larger fiscal package with a
different composition than we have assumed in the baseline.
Turning to the trajectory for the economy over the medium term, we continue to
project real GDP to increase 2¼ percent in 2017, with solid gains in consumer spending
and a pickup in business investment. Growth then slows to 2 percent in 2018 and
1¾ percent in 2019 as monetary policy continues to tighten. With GDP growing faster
than potential over most of the medium term, the output gap widens to 1½ percent at the
end of 2019, an upward revision of nearly ½ percentage point relative to the October
Tealbook. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate is projected to fall to 4.2 percent by
2019—about ¾ percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate and ¼ percentage
point lower than in October—and the labor force participation rate is projected to decline
somewhat more slowly than its trend.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
the September FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff's current economic
projection with the one we presented in the September Tealbook.
We have strengthened the projection this round by about the same amount as we weakened
it in the October Tealbook, and, on net, the projection is little changed from September.
GDP growth is about the same, and the unemployment rate still reaches 4.2 percent at the
end of 2019.
PCE inflation (both total and core) has come in higher in the second half of this year than we
anticipated in September, and we have carried forward a bit of that surprise into the
projection for next year. But the inflation forecast is otherwise unrevised, and we continue
to project that PCE inflation will move up and reach 1.9 percent by 2019.
We have raised our assumed longer-run value of the real equilibrium federal funds rate to
1.0 percent in this forecast, up from 0.75 percent in the September Tealbook. But with the
outlook little changed and this higher equilibrium rate phased in gradually, the funds rate
path from the intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline
forecast is about the same as in September through most of the projection period.

Given how flat the Phillips curve appears to be and our judgment that inflation u t

expectations will remain well anchored, we have barely revised our forecast for inflation
&
from the October Tealbook despite the modestly stronger economic outlook. We e l

continue to project that both total and core PCE price inflation will move up gradually to D

1.9 percent in 2019, as the effects of earlier energy and import price declines fade and o

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
o
D
Fiscal Policy
 Considerable uncertainty prevails about the size, timing, and composition of
any potential fiscal policy changes that may be enacted in coming years.
Nonetheless, relative to our October projection, we have assumed an increase
in annual federal “primary” budget deficits (that is, the deficit excluding
interest costs) of 1 percent of GDP. For now, we have assumed this fiscal
expansion takes the form of a cut in personal income taxes that commences in
the third quarter of 2017.1
 The tax cut is estimated to have essentially no effect on potential output, but it
boosts aggregate demand and hence would raise the growth rate of real GDP
roughly ¼ percentage point per year in each of 2017, 2018, and 2019 absent
any multiplier effects and offsets from higher interest rates and the dollar. We
now project that discretionary policy actions at all levels of government,
including the aforementioned tax cut, will provide a partial-equilibrium boost
to real GDP growth of ½ percentage point in 2017 and more than
¼ percentage point in both 2018 and 2019.2
Monetary Policy
 In the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use to mechanically set the federal
funds rate in our projection, we increased the real long-run equilibrium federal
funds rate from ¾ percent to 1 percent in response to the persistent fiscal
1 A decrease in personal taxes serves as a useful placeholder partly because some plausible policy
actions (such as an increase in government purchases) would likely have larger effects on GDP growth,
while other plausible actions (such as corporate tax cuts) would likely have smaller effects.
2 Aside from the tax cut, we have built in no additional changes to our policy assumptions in this
projection.

 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current D
level until the third quarter of 2017 and then begin to contract, as the proceeds
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is revised markedly higher in this projection,
reflecting the upward revisions to the projected path of future short-term
interest rates over the valuation window as well as higher projected term
premiums. We project the 10-year Treasury yield to rise significantly over the
medium term, reaching 3.9 percent by the end of 2019—about 70 basis points
higher than in the October projection.
 We have revised up the projected paths for the triple-B corporate bond yields
and 30-year fixed mortgage rates by about as much as those of Treasury
securities.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Since the previous Tealbook, broad equity indexes have increased about
4 percent. As a result, we nudged up the path of stock prices over the
3 The fiscal assumptions influence the long-run equilibrium federal funds rate because the policy
changes are persistent and boost demand in the longer run. We assume that the dual mandate is achieved in
the long run via a combination of a higher real federal funds rate and a rise in term premiums. The
magnitude of the assumed overall increase in the 10-year Treasury rate is broadly consistent with the
empirical evidence regarding the effects of increased government debt on interest rates and is in line with
simulations of the revised fiscal assumptions conducted using the FRB/US model. The decomposition of
the overall increment to the 10-year rate into its funds rate and term premium components is highly
uncertain.
4 One argument for phasing in the adjustment to the long-run equilibrium rate rather than
assuming that it prevails immediately is that the boost to consumer spending is likewise assumed to phase
in over three years.
5 Compared with its prescription for the October Tealbook, a non-inertial rule would have revised
up about 65 basis points at the end of 2019.

n 5¾ percent in 2016 to an average annual increase of 3¾ percent over the

c

D Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign real GDP growth rebounded to an annual rate of 3 percent in the third
quarter, ½ percentage point higher than estimated in the October Tealbook.
This rebound was driven by stronger growth in Canada, Mexico, and Japan.
Growth abroad is projected to average about 2½ percent over the remainder of
the forecast period, supported by accommodative monetary policies in the
advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and a moderate recovery in South
America. This outlook is revised down slightly in the near term as a result of
tighter financial conditions and weaker data in the emerging market
economies (EMEs) but revised up later in the forecast period in response to
stronger U.S. demand.
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated about 3 percent since the time of the
October Tealbook, with the rise occurring subsequent to the U.S. election and
coming more against EME currencies than against AFE currencies. We
expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at about a 1¼ percent annual rate
through the forecast period, as market expectations for the federal funds rate
move up toward the staff forecast. Relative to the October Tealbook, our
projection for the broad real dollar by the end of 2019 is 2¼ percent higher.
Oil Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has increased about $3.50 per barrel since
the close of the October Tealbook and is now trading at $55 per barrel. This
increase is mostly explained by the OPEC agreement reached on November
30 to cut oil production.6 This agreement extends only through the middle of
6 OPEC countries agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, and some non-OPEC
countries are expected to agree at their December 10 meeting to cut production by 0.6 million barrels per
day.

2017, leaving it unclear what happens afterward. In fact, December 2019 u t
O
Brent futures prices are down about $1.25 per barrel since the close of the
&
October Tealbook and currently stand at $58 per barrel. All told, the average e l
v
e
price of oil over the forecast period is little changed from the October D
n
Tealbook. o

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP t i
s
e
m
o
We estimate that real GDP is increasing at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the
D
second half of the year after rising only 1 percent in the first half. The step-up reflects
the stabilization of inventory investment as well as larger gains in government spending
against a backdrop of continued solid increases in PDFP. Real GDP is then projected to
grow 2½ percent in the first quarter of next year. Our GDP forecast for the second half of
this year is slightly stronger than in the October Tealbook.
 We estimate that consumer spending is rising at an average annual rate of
2½ percent in the second half of this year, and we expect it to rise at the same
pace in the first quarter of next year, supported by continued gains in
employment and household income as well as earlier increases in household
wealth. Our near-term forecast for consumer spending is a little higher than in
the October Tealbook, reflecting stronger incoming spending data and an
upward revision to the BEA’s estimate of disposable income in the second and
third quarters.
 The BEA reported that investment for equipment and intangibles declined at
an annual rate of 2½ percent in the third quarter, well below our projection in
the October Tealbook. However, with orders of nondefense capital goods
rising recently and business sentiment generally supportive, we expect
moderate growth in equipment investment this quarter and the next. In
addition, we still expect investment in drilling and mining structures to start to
move up this quarter after having declined for the past two years. On net, our
near-term forecast for business investment is little changed from the October
Tealbook.
 Single-family housing starts jumped in October and were well above our
expectations. Together with upward revisions to other incoming source data,
these data suggest that residential investment will show an overall increase in

the second half of this year, compared with the roughly 3 percent rate of u t
O
decline that we projected in the October Tealbook. Given lean inventories of

homes for sale and ongoing solid gains in house prices, we expect e l
v
e
construction activity to increase further in early 2017, albeit at a modest rate. D

c
 Very little inventory data are yet available for the fourth quarter, but the E
c
staff’s flow-of-goods system shows inventory-to-sales ratios near comfortable t i
s
e
levels in most sectors outside of energy (inventories of energy products m
o
D
remain very high). Consequently, we expect inventory investment to change
little on net over this quarter and the next, consistent with the projected steady
growth in final sales, and to have little effect on GDP growth.
 Net exports boosted real GDP growth more than ¾ percentage point in the
third quarter, largely because of unseasonably strong soybean exports. In the
fourth quarter, net exports are projected to subtract ½ percentage point, as
exports are projected to decline moderately (reflecting in part a more normal
pace of soybean exports). More broadly, we continue to view net exports as
being held down by a strong dollar, weak foreign demand, and firming U.S.
growth. This drag extends for several years and is a bit larger than in the
previous forecast.
 The level of manufacturing production has changed little, on net, in recent
months (indeed, since late 2014), restrained by weak export demand,
spillovers from earlier declines in oil and gas drilling, and slow domestic
capital investment more generally. We expect factory output to continue on
this flat trajectory over the near term despite some modest improvement
recently in the readings for new orders from the national and regional
manufacturing surveys.
Over the medium term, GDP growth is expected to ease gradually from its pace in
the second half of this year, eventually slowing to 1¾ percent in 2019, as monetary policy
continues to tighten.
 The projection for real GDP growth has been boosted by our assumption of
more expansionary fiscal policy. After taking into account multiplier effects
as well as the offset from higher interest rates, these tax cuts raise the level of
real GDP ½ percent by the end of 2019. Interest rates have already risen in

u t anticipation of a change in fiscal policy, and the associated restraint on
O
activity is relatively front-loaded in our projection. By contrast, the stimulus
&
e l is relatively back-loaded, as we do not—for example—have households
v
e
D spending any of the additional disposable income associated with the assumed
n
o tax cut in advance of its implementation; on the contrary, we have them
c
E
adjusting the level of their spending upward over a period of three years,
c
i
t
s consistent with the response from earlier episodes. Other factors affecting the
e
m
o medium-term projection are a slight drag on balance.
D
 As in the October Tealbook, we expect potential output growth to pick up
gradually from 1½ percent this year to 1¾ percent at the end of the medium
term, owing to an acceleration in structural labor productivity.
 With GDP growth expected to outpace our estimate of potential growth over
the medium term, aggregate output moves further above our estimate of its
sustainable level. At the end of 2019, we forecast real GDP to be 1½ percent
above potential—an output gap that is nearly ½ percentage point higher than
in the October Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
The two employment reports we have received since the October Tealbook
indicate that the labor market has continued to tighten.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment is currently reported to have increased an
average of 176,000 per month over the three months through November,
which was very close to our forecast in the October Tealbook. This pace is
above the range of 80,000 to 110,000 per month that we see as consistent with
unchanged labor market conditions—that is, a flat unemployment rate and
labor force participation declining in parallel with its trend path.
 The unemployment rate is estimated to have fallen from 4.9 percent in
October to 4.6 percent in November, ¼ percentage point below our
expectation in the October Tealbook. We expect that some of last month’s
decline will be unwound in the months ahead; the unemployment rate is
projected to be 4.7 percent in December and in the first quarter of next year,
0.1 percentage point lower than our previous forecast.

 The labor force participation rate declined 0.1 percentage point in both u

October and November; at 62.7 percent, the November level was &

0.1 percentage point below the previous forecast. We expect the participation e
v
e
rate to remain at this level through the first quarter of next year, unchanged D
n
from our previous projection. The employment-to-population ratio has edged o
c
E
up, on net, in the second half of this year and, relative to its declining trend,
c
i
t
has improved 0.3 percentage point. s

D
 Other indicators of labor market conditions have continued to improve. The
share of employed individuals working part time for economic reasons edged
down, on balance, this year, as has the share of long-term unemployed. The
rate of layoffs, as measured by initial claims and JOLTS data, has remained
low, and households’ assessments of job availability have continued to rise.
 The labor market conditions index, or LMCI, ticked up over the past three
months, driven by improvements both in unemployment and hiring indicators
and in consumer and business assessments of the jobs situation.
 We view the labor market as a touch beyond full employment. In the fourth
quarter, we expect the unemployment rate to average ¼ percentage point
below our estimate of its natural rate and the employment-to-population ratio
to be ¼ percentage point above our estimate of its trend.
 Labor productivity in the business sector is now estimated to have increased
3¾ percent in the third quarter, about ¾ percentage point stronger than in the
previous Tealbook, but was unchanged relative to its level four quarters
earlier.
The medium-term outlook for the labor market is stronger than in the October
Tealbook, reflecting the stronger projection for real GDP.
 The path of monthly job gains is about 20,000 higher than in the October
Tealbook, bringing the level of payroll employment at the end of 2019 to
about 700,000 above the previous projection. We now expect average
monthly total payroll gains to slow from about 180,000 in 2017 to about
160,000 in 2018 and 120,000 in 2019.

Tealbook, we have nudged up the participation rate projection a bit.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The incoming data on consumer prices have been about in line with our
expectations in the October Tealbook, and our inflation forecast is little revised.
 The 12-month change in total PCE prices, at 1.4 percent in October, is
expected to move up, reflecting both recent increases in crude oil prices and
the effect of earlier declines in gasoline prices dropping out of the calculation;
the 12-month change briefly reaches 2 percent in March 2017 before easing to
1.8 percent in the second quarter. The 12-month change in core PCE prices
was 1.7 percent in October and is projected to remain at about that level over
the near term.
 Measured on a quarterly average basis, core PCE price inflation is estimated
to be lower in the second half of this year (at 1.6 percent) relative to the first
half (1.9 percent), when inflation was boosted by some volatile price
categories and by what appears to be residual seasonality. We now project
core PCE price inflation to be 1.7 percent in the first quarter of next year,
essentially unchanged from the October Tealbook.
 Headline PCE inflation is estimated to be above core inflation in the second
half, as energy prices have risen appreciably in recent months amid increases
in gasoline prices driven by supply disruptions and higher crude oil costs.

 Core import prices are projected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter of u
O
2016, little changed from the October Tealbook, as a boost from higher metals &
l
prices offsets the recent dollar appreciation. In the first quarter of 2017, an e
v
e
ongoing drag from the recent appreciation of the dollar is expected to cause D
n
core import prices to continue edging down. Thereafter, we expect import o
c
E
price inflation to turn positive and move up to a ¾ percent rate by the end of
c
i
t
2017, consistent with moderate foreign inflation and relatively flat projected s
e
m
trajectories for the dollar and commodity prices. o
D
 With regard to longer-term inflation expectations, the median of expectations
over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey moved up from its
historical low of 2.4 percent in October to 2.6 percent in November.
Similarly, the TIPS-based measure of 5-to-10-year-forward inflation
compensation has risen to 2 percent, a noticeable increase from its reading of
1.6 percent at the time of the October Tealbook. In contrast, some other
survey measures remained unchanged. Expected PCE price inflation over the
next 10 years from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of
Professional Forecasters remained at 2 percent in the fourth quarter, and the
3-year-ahead measure of inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectation remained at 2.6 percent in
October.
Both total and core PCE inflation are anticipated to trend up to 1.9 percent by
2019 as resource utilization tightens and the drag from earlier energy and import price
declines wanes. As in previous Tealbooks, we have assumed a small pickup (5 basis
points in each of 2018 and 2019) in the prevailing level of inflation expectations relevant
for wage and price setting.
 These projections are essentially unchanged from the October Tealbook
despite the modestly stronger outlook for resource utilization, as we estimate
the Phillips curve to be quite flat.
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our core inflation projection for 2016 has
been revised up 0.3 percentage point in response to factors that we consider
largely transitory. Our projection for 2017 core inflation is unrevised. (See
the exhibit “Sources of Inflation Forecast Revisions since the December 2015
Tealbook” for additional information.)

u t The data on labor compensation received since the previous Tealbook have been
O
mixed; taken together, we view these data as broadly consistent with a labor market that
&
e l is operating close to its sustainable level against a backdrop of very sluggish trend growth
v
e
D in productivity. The box “Measures of Labor Compensation” discusses the primary
n
o differences in these measures.
c

c
i
t  Average hourly earnings for all employees edged down in November
s
e
m
following a relatively large gain in October. Over the past 12 months, this
o
D
measure of wages has increased 2½ percent after rising at a relatively steady
pace of 2 percent earlier in the recovery period.
 With an upward revision to wages and salaries in the latest NIPA data,
compensation per hour in the business sector is now estimated to have risen
2¾ percent over the four quarters through 2016:Q3, up from our estimate in
the October Tealbook but about the same rate as seen, on average, in the past
four years.
 The employment cost index rose about 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending
in September, up just slightly from an average pace of 2 percent in recent
years.
 The Wage Growth Tracker from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests
the median growth in wages has been 3.9 percent over the past 12 months.
This movement continues an upward trend seen over the past year and brings
the increases in this measure of wage growth close to pre-recession levels.
We continue to project that hourly labor compensation growth in the business
sector will pick up gradually as the labor market tightens further; we have revised up the
medium-term projection a bit, reflecting the lower unemployment rate in this Tealbook.7
(See the box “Alternative View: The Rise in Real Wages” for an argument that wage
pressures are greater than judged by the staff.)
7 Our models find a notably stronger effect of resource utilization on compensation growth
(especially compensation per hour in the business sector) than on price inflation.

Measures of Labor Compensation
&

e
v
The staff closely monitors several measures of labor compensation constructed by the e
D
Bureau of Labor Statistics: the employment cost index for private industry workers (ECI),
n
compensation per hour in the business sector (CPH), and average hourly earnings of all o
c
employees (AHE). Additional measures of compensation that the staff follows include the E
c
Wage Growth Tracker (WGT) constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a few i
t
s
indicators derived from other surveys. e
m
o
D
Although these measures of labor compensation tend to move in a broadly similar manner
over longer horizons, they often send different signals over shorter periods, as shown in
figures 1 and 2. Since mid‐2014, those focusing on wages and salaries only (the AHE, the
WGT, and a component of the ECI) suggest that nominal wage growth has been picking up,
with the WGT showing the most pronounced increase; for the broader compensation
measures (overall ECI and CPH), the evidence of a pickup is less clear. While the distinction
between total compensation and the narrower concept of wages and salaries can account
for some of the disparities across the measures, other differences in the concepts and
methodologies used to construct these measures are also important.
The table on the last page of this box compares the four series across some key dimensions.
In particular, the various measures differ in their focus in the following ways:
 The AHE is designed as a timely monthly measure of wages (no benefits included)
and is released as part of the monthly employment report. It is calculated as total
wages divided by total hours paid for all employees in private nonfarm
establishments. As a result, an increase in wages for high earners moves the
measure more than a similarly proportioned increase for lower‐wage workers.
 The WGT is designed to measure the median change in hourly wages (no benefits
included) of individuals, based on self‐reported usual earnings by households in the
Current Population Survey (CPS). The index covers only individuals who were
earning at a rate of less than $150,000 per year and who were in the sample and
employed full time both in the current month of the CPS and one year earlier. It is

O the only measure constructed from the perspective of the household (as opposed to
& the employer). Unlike the AHE and CPH, this measure does not give more weight to
l
e high earners than low earners.
v
e
D
 The ECI is designed to measure the change in the cost (both wages and benefits) of
n
o hiring labor services. It is calculated as an average change in compensation, holding
c
E fixed industry and occupation weights, as well as most changes in overtime hours
c
i worked and benefits usage.1 As a result, it captures increases in compensation for
t
s
e particular jobs, but it is designed to exclude the effects of increased overtime use or
m
o a faster pace of job promotions during expansions, as well as shifts toward higher‐
D
productivity, higher‐wage occupations or industries. This is one possible reason why
the ECI has had a lower average growth rate than the CPH and the WGT over the
past 20 years. The ECI is the only measure that includes detail on the components of
benefits (for example, health insurance).2 In recent quarters, relatively muted
increases in the growth of these benefits costs have balanced out a modest pickup
in wage growth in the ECI.
 The CPH is a measure of overall compensation received by employees in the
business sector, calculated as total compensation (including some components not
found in the ECI, such as stock options) divided by hours, based on the quarterly
national income and product accounts (NIPA) data. It is the most inclusive of all the
different measures of labor compensation, but it is also far more variable at a
quarterly frequency than any of the other measures. This variability may occur, in
part, both because the CPH is influenced by the changing mix of jobs and because it
includes highly volatile components such as stock options and bonuses. Of all the
measures discussed here, the CPH co‐varies most strongly with the unemployment
gap. Unlike the other series, it is susceptible to large revisions.
Each of these measures has strengths and weaknesses, and there is no single preferred
measure. The CPH, being the most comprehensive measure of total compensation, is
probably the most useful for questions regarding consumption behavior. It is also the only
measure with an associated and directly comparable measure of labor productivity, so it is
convenient for measuring unit labor costs. The ECI is probably the most relevant measure
for gauging wage pressure experienced by firms, and it is the only comprehensive
compensation measure that the staff has found to have some explanatory power for price
inflation in recent years.3 The AHE is a timely and straightforward measure. The WGT is
relatively new and we are still learning about its properties, but bringing in information from
the CPS would seem to represent a useful complement to the other measures.
1 There are some features of the ECI that are not fixed. For example, the experience profile of the
workforce within particular job categories and the use of incentive pay affect the ECI and are likely to
change depending on the economic climate.
2 With the exception of health insurance, the benefits detail is unpublished and confidential.

O Alternative View: The Rise in Real Wages1
&
l The unemployment rate has fallen considerably over the past several years.
e
v However, there has been only a modest pickup in nominal wage growth, which
e
D
some consider a puzzle. The staff view is that nominal wage growth has not been
n
o surprisingly weak over this period but has been consistent with long-run trends for
c
E inflation and productivity and with labor market slack. This alternative view
c
i questions whether those long-run trends are the right benchmark and notes that
t
s
e nominal wage growth has actually been stronger than one would expect based on
m
o the recent behavior of inflation and productivity. Accordingly, recent wage growth
D
may be indicative of more wage pressures than the staff recognizes.
Frictionless real business cycle models imply that wages should move one-for-one
with inflation and productivity. While these models are clearly counterfactual, they
do motivate comparing real wages to productivity as a means of gauging wage
pressures in the economy. The labor share, which equals the ratio of real wages per
hour to output per hour, provides a convenient means of making that comparison.
Figure 1 plots the labor share on a four-quarter moving average basis from 1972:Q2
to 2016:Q3. As the figure indicates, there has been a modest pickup in the share of
output accruing to labor over the past several quarters. While this pickup follows an
extended decline, it is worth noting that over the past 45 years, there have been
only three prior episodes of a rise in the labor share.1
The extended decline in the labor share over the past 15 years indicates that a stable
one-for-one relationship between output and wages may not exist. Indeed, in a
simple regression of log real wages per hour on log output per hour, the estimated
coefficient on output per hour equals 0.91, which is well below the expected
Note: This alternative view was prepared by Missaka Warusawitharana.
1 For a discussion of the changes in the labor share over time, see Michael W. L. Elsby, Bart
Hobijn, and Aysegul Sahin (2013), “The Decline of the U.S. Labor Share,” Brookings Papers on
Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 1–63, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-

coefficient of 1.00, consistent with the fact that over the sample period, wage O
growth has not kept pace with output growth. Figure 2 presents the regression &
l
residuals, which are referred to as the wage–productivity gap. A positive (negative) e
v
gap implies that wages are elevated (depressed) relative to the relationship implied e
D
by the regression model. A potential implication of this residual is that when the n
o
wage gap is depressed, wages are not putting a great deal of pressure on firm costs, c
E
thus holding down pressures on price inflation. c
i
t
s
e
As figure 2 indicates, real wages were depressed relative to productivity in the m
o
aftermath of the financial crisis. The wage–productivity gap remained negative for D
several years and began to turn up in 2014. Since then, it has increased about
3 percentage points. This rise indicates a noticeable improvement in real wages
relative to productivity, suggestive of greater wage pressures in the economy. As of
2016:Q3, the gap is close to zero, implying that the level of wages is close to that
implied by the estimated relationship between productivity and wages.
This perspective differs from the staff view. The staff framework evaluates nominal
wage gains relative to judgmental long-run trends for inflation and productivity,
both of which exceeded realized values over the past three years, as energy prices
fell and productivity growth was especially weak. 2 As shown in the table, according
to the staff view, wage growth over the past three years was consistent with these
long-run trends. In contrast, relative to recent inflation and productivity, wages
rose about 1 percent per year over the past three years, a notable rate of increase.
To conclude, the staff view is that wage growth over the past several years has been
consistent with slack and long-run trends for inflation and productivity. However,
when compared with recent inflation and productivity, wage growth has been quite
strong. If firms were to pass these higher wages into prices, inflation would exceed
that of the baseline forecast.

u t THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
O
&
l  We continue to assume a natural rate of unemployment in the longer run of
e
v
e 5 percent and a longer-run growth rate of potential GDP of 1.7 percent.
D
n
o
c  In response to the assumption of persistently more stimulative fiscal policy,
E
c the long-run value of the real federal funds rate has been revised up from
i
t
s
e ¾ percent to 1 percent. The fiscal policy assumption also is the reason for a
m
o
D ⅛ percentage point upward revision to the term premium due to the additional
supply of Treasury debt that would be forthcoming with a more expansionary
fiscal stance. All told, the yield on 10-year Treasury securities is 3½ percent
in the long run, ⅜ percentage point higher than in the October Tealbook.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by 2022.
 With output running above its potential and inflation at the Committee’s
2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about ¾ percentage point
above its long-run value of 3 percent in 2020, increases to nearly 4 percent in
2021, and then moves back toward its long-run value thereafter.
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates further,
growing 1.5 percent in 2020 and 1.3 percent in 2021. The unemployment rate
is 4.3 percent in 2020 and rises gradually toward its assumed natural rate in
subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up from 1.9 percent in 2019 and slightly
overshoots the Committee’s long-run objective in 2020 and 2021 before
gradually converging to 2 percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign real GDP growth rebounded to 3 percent in the third quarter from an
unusually subdued 1¼ percent pace in the second quarter. This bounceback, which was
½ percentage point greater than we had expected, was primarily driven by stronger
growth in Canada and Mexico, where the second-quarter pothole was concentrated. We
see foreign growth slowing to 2¼ percent in the current quarter.
Over the remainder of the forecast period, we project foreign growth to edge up to
k
2½ percent, supported by accommodative monetary policies in the advanced foreign o
o
economies (AFEs) and a moderate recovery in South America. An important t l
u
O
development affecting the foreign outlook has been the prospect of U.S. fiscal expansion,
&
which has several distinct and offsetting effects in our baseline. First, higher U.S. GDP l
e
v
growth boosts U.S. imports and thus economic activity abroad, although, as discussed in e
D
the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section, it will take a couple of years n
o
c
for the benefits to materialize. Second, anticipation of looser U.S. fiscal policy has likely E
l
’
t
already contributed to strengthening the dollar, which should raise foreign n
I
competitiveness and growth. But such anticipation has also pushed up interest rates here
and abroad, which should restrain foreign growth, especially in some vulnerable
emerging market economies (EMEs) where higher interest rates have increased financial
stresses. All told, relative to the October Tealbook, the foreign outlook is down slightly
in the near term as the tighter financial conditions are felt, but up later in the forecast
period as the effect of tax cuts on U.S. spending and imports more fully shows through.
As usual, considerable uncertainty attends the foreign outlook. Much of this
uncertainty is now about the course of U.S. policy. A stronger fiscal expansion than we
are assuming would likely boost foreign growth, while less expansion would lower it.
As there is a wide range of possible trade policy actions that the new U.S. government
could take, we are not assuming any changes in trade policy in this forecast, but actions
that raise barriers to international trade would likely lower foreign growth. Moreover, the
higher interest rates and stronger dollar built into our current outlook may lead to greater
financial stress in EMEs—and, thus, greater shortfalls in their growth—than we are
assuming in our baseline projection; see the “Stronger Dollar and EME Financial
Turbulence” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. In addition, a number of risks
to European growth remain salient, including negotiations over Brexit, possible gains by
Page 41 of 100

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) December 7, 2016
anti-EU parties in upcoming elections, and difficulties in recapitalizing the banking
system (particularly following the failed constitutional referendum in Italy). Finally,
risks associated with the vulnerable Chinese financial sector are never far from
our minds.
Inflation in most AFEs has increased in recent months but remains significantly
below central bank targets. In line with still-muted core inflation readings and sluggish
elimination of slack, we see AFE inflation rising only gradually, reaching 1½ percent in
the euro area and 1¼ percent in Japan in 2019. By contrast, in the United Kingdom,
where the substantial depreciation of the pound since the summer is pushing up consumer
k
o
o prices, we expect inflation will be well above the Bank of England’s (BOE) 2 percent
l
t
u target in 2017. In the EMEs, as food prices stabilize in China and as exchange rate
O
& depreciation in some countries passes through to prices, inflation is expected to increase
l
e
v to 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter and stay slightly above this rate thereafter. All told,
e
D
our outlook for inflation abroad is little changed despite the recent OPEC agreement to
n
o
cut oil production. Although this agreement led to an increase in spot oil prices, this
c
E
l increase merely reversed declines that had taken place earlier in the intermeeting period,
’
t
n
I and the overall projected path of oil prices is little changed from the previous Tealbook.
Given the subdued outlook for inflation, we continue to assume that monetary
policy in the AFEs will stay highly accommodative through 2019. We expect that the
BOE will raise the Bank Rate 25 basis points in late 2017 in response to above-target
inflation, but only to ½ percent. In the EMEs, the central banks of Turkey and Mexico
raised policy rates to counteract inflationary pressures from recent exchange rate
depreciation, while the central banks of Brazil and Argentina, with some improvement in
their inflation situation, cut their policy rates to support growth.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Canada. Real GDP grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter after contracting
1.3 percent in the second quarter. The expansion was led by private consumption
and a strong rebound in energy exports following disruptive wildfires in May.
More-recent indicators, such as manufacturing PMIs through November, suggest a
moderation in growth in the current quarter. We expect GDP growth to average
2 percent in 2017, supported by a weak Canadian dollar and accommodative
monetary and fiscal policies, before settling a bit below 2 percent by mid-2018.
Relative to the October Tealbook, this projection is a touch weaker through
Page 42 of 100

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) December 7, 2016
mid-2017, reflecting somewhat tighter financial conditions, and slightly stronger in
2019 on the markup in U.S. growth.
• Euro Area. Real GDP grew 1.4 percent in the third quarter. More-recent indicators,
such as rising composite PMIs and strong retail sales, suggest that growth picked up
to 1¾ percent in the current quarter. Moving forward, we expect growing political
backlash against fiscal austerity to lead to slightly more expansionary fiscal policies,
such as in France and Italy. Accordingly, with monetary policy remaining
accommodative, we see GDP growth edging up close to 2 percent by 2019. Overall,
this projection is slightly higher than in the October Tealbook, reflecting better-than-
k
expected indicators and more-expansionary fiscal policy both in the United States o
o
l
t
and the euro area. That said, our growth projections for Italy and other vulnerable u
O
economies are slightly weaker than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting tighter &
l
financial conditions. e
v
e
D
With anti-EU sentiment prevalent across the euro area and with national elections in n
o
c
France, Germany, and possibly Italy looming next year, elevated political E
l
’
uncertainty is likely to trigger bouts of volatility and financial stress. Moreover, n t
I
deep-seated weaknesses in the banking sector persist. In particular, Italian banks
have been struggling to raise capital, and their efforts will likely be complicated by
political uncertainty following the Italian referendum. Our projection assumes that
these headwinds will weigh on the euro-area recovery but not derail it. However,
more-dire outcomes for European banks remain a significant risk, as discussed in the
“Banking Crisis in Europe” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
As core inflation and inflation expectations remain persistently low, inflation is
projected to rise only slowly, from just above 1 percent in the third quarter to
1½ percent in late 2018. Accordingly, we expect that this week the European
Central Bank (ECB) will commit to purchasing assets at least through
September 2017. We assume that the ECB will wait until late 2017 to begin tapering
purchases and until early 2018 to cease them entirely.
• Japan. Real GDP growth rebounded to 2.2 percent in the third quarter,
1¼ percentage points higher than estimated in the October Tealbook. However, this
rebound largely reflects a plunge in imports and payback from earlier earthquake-
related disruptions, while domestic demand was disappointing. Indeed, more-recent
data, such as industrial production for October, point to only moderate underlying

momentum. Accordingly, we expect growth to slow to about 1 percent through the
end of 2018 before decelerating to zero in 2019 as a result of a planned consumption
tax hike. This projection is slightly higher than in the October Tealbook, primarily
owing to a weaker yen.
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth slowed to 2 percent in the third quarter from
2.7 percent in the second quarter because of somewhat weaker domestic demand.
Stronger-than-expected indicators suggest growth edged down just a little in the
current quarter, but we still see it falling to 1¼ percent early next year. Thereafter,
growth recovers to 1¾ percent by 2019. Our medium-term growth projection is a

D

t
n first quarter of 2017 because of past pound depreciation and to remain above the
I
BOE’s 2 percent target through the end of the year. Accordingly, we now expect
that the BOE will increase the Bank Rate 25 basis points in the second half of 2017.
We also assume the BOE will complete its sovereign bond purchase program early
next year and continue purchasing corporate bonds through the first quarter of 2018.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• Mexico. Mexican real GDP growth bounced back from its earlier pothole much more
sharply than we anticipated, surging to 4 percent in the third quarter from just
1 percent in the first half of the year, almost 2 percentage points above our October
Tealbook estimate. Household demand was robust, supported by rapid credit growth
amid low unemployment. However, we see Mexican GDP growth moderating to
2 percent in the current quarter, consistent with recent declines in consumer and
business confidence as well as manufacturing PMI. Growth should remain at this
pace over most of 2017 before picking up to 2¾ percent by 2019, supported by the
1 The lower likelihood of a hard Brexit partly results from a ruling in early November by the U.K.
High Court that the U.K. parliament must consent before the government begins the exit process from the
European Union by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The government appealed the decision, and
the U.K. Supreme Court is expected to unveil its final decision early next year.

peso’s depreciation, a pickup in U.S. manufacturing, and energy-sector reforms.
Relative to the October Tealbook, we have lowered growth a bit in the near term as a
result of tightened financial conditions. Inflation should edge up to almost 4 percent
in the current quarter, pressured by pass-through from the peso’s depreciation. To
keep inflationary pressures in check, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate in mid-
November and is expected to tighten its stance further at its next meeting in mid-
December. With medium- and long-term inflation expectations well-anchored, we
see inflation settling down to about 3¼ percent by early 2018.
• Brazil. Brazil’s deepest recession on record continued in the third quarter, with real
k
GDP declining 3.3 percent. Investment plunged at a double-digit rate amid a cutback o
o
l
t
in access to subsidized credit and resurfacing worries about the political situation, u
O
while household demand continued its decline amid rising unemployment. The &
l
disappointing tone of incoming data—especially the step-down in industrial e
v
e
production in October and in consumer confidence in November—prompted us to D
n
factor in a further GDP decline in the current quarter. We expect Brazil’s recovery to o
c
E
begin in 2017 but to be very gradual, with restrictive monetary and fiscal policies
l
’
t
n
weighing on demand. In late November, the central bank cut its policy rate 25 basis I
points to 13.75 percent in response to the weak economy and some signs that
inflationary pressures are abating. We expect inflation to ease to the 4.5 percent
inflation target by 2019.
• China. After slowing to 6.8 percent in the third quarter, real GDP growth is expected
to ease further to 6¼ percent in the current quarter. Most of this slowdown reflects
continued decline in investment as fiscal and monetary stimulus tapers off.
Macroprudential measures introduced in October are starting to reduce house sales,
and we also expect real estate investment to slow. Meanwhile, growth of both
exports and imports has been sluggish in recent months. All told, growth for 2016 is
projected to be 6¾ percent, within the authorities’ target range of 6½ to 7 percent.
Growth should slow to 5¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, in line with
declining potential growth. Falling food prices pushed down inflation to an estimated
1½ percent in the third quarter. We expect inflation to rebound as food prices
stabilize before settling at around 2½ percent by early next year.
• Other Emerging Asia. Growth in the region held at 3½ percent in the third quarter,
as the payback in Hong Kong from outsized second-quarter growth was offset by a

surge in India linked to strong private consumption. In line with recent indicators
pointing to a slowdown in economic activity, especially in India and South Korea, we
expect growth in the region to moderate to 3 percent in the current quarter. Going
forward, growth should rise to 3½ percent by mid-2017 as both domestic and external
demand firm.
During the intermeeting period, the Indian government, in an effort to combat
o
corruption and tax evasion, demonetized overnight the two highest
denomination bank notes, equivalent to $7.50 and $15, which accounted for
almost 90 percent of the value of currency in circulation.2 Since this move,
k
o
we have received November PMI indicators, which have led us to revise down
o
l

u growth in the current and next quarters.
O
&
l In South Korea, a scandal involving President Park, combined with the
e o
v
e ongoing crisis in the shipping industry related to the bankruptcy of one of
D
n Korea’s largest shipping firms, has contributed to a plunge in consumer

E confidence. These developments have led us to revise down a touch Korean

2 Under this demonetization program, holders of the bank notes have until December 30 to trade in
their old bank notes at any bank branch. However, if holders cannot justify how they accumulated the bank
notes, they have to pay a penalty of around 60 percent of their value. As of early December, around
55 percent of the estimated bank notes in circulation, representing $130 billion, have been traded in.

Financial Developments
The U.S. election results were the primary catalyst for developments in financial
markets during the intermeeting period. Overall, asset price movements and the policy
path in the United States appeared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansive
fiscal policy, as well as potential changes to trade, regulatory, and other policies. In
addition, prices of some risky assets may have reflected an improvement in risk
sentiment. Global markets also responded strongly to U.S. developments. Meanwhile,
incoming U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve communications reinforced market
participants’ expectations for a policy rate increase at the December meeting.
 Based on a straight read of market quotes, the probability of a rate hike in
December increased to about 90 percent from around 60 percent just prior to
the November FOMC meeting. Further out, the market-implied path of the
policy rate moved up 55 basis points at the end of 2018, to its highest level
since early January.
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities increased 30, 55,
and 60 basis points, respectively, and the 5-to-10-year forward rate rose
67 basis points, amid higher uncertainty for longer-dated interest rates. Both s

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period and domestic
economic data releases reportedly reinforced investors’ expectations of an increase in the
target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting, with a straight read of
federal funds futures contracts suggesting a 90 percent probability of a rate hike in
December. Looking further ahead, investors marked up considerably their expected path
for the policy rate over the intermeeting period, with the federal funds rate implied by
OIS quotes at the end of 2017 and 2018 moving up 26 basis points and 55 basis points,
respectively. Most of the steepening of the market-implied policy path occurred
following the election, apparently reflecting investors’ perception of greater-than-
expected fiscal stimulus. Market-based measures of uncertainty regarding monetary
policy at horizons beyond one year moved up, suggesting that some of the firming in OIS
rates could reflect a rise in term premiums. Indeed, after adjusting for term premiums
using the staff’s preferred model, the expected policy rate by the end of 2017 and 2018
rose 13 basis points and 36 basis points, respectively.1
Nominal Treasury yields moved up, on net, since the November FOMC meeting,
with 2-, 5- and 10-year yields rising 30, 55, and 60 basis points, respectively. Medium-
and longer-term yields were boosted by roughly equal increases in real yields and s
t
n
inflation compensation. In particular, 5-year and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based measures of e
m
p
inflation compensation rose 24 basis points and 34 basis points, respectively, continuing o
l
e
their upward trajectory over the second half of this year. Market-based measures of v
e
D
inflation compensation based on inflation swaps posted similar gains. Quotes on
l
a
i
inflation caps and floors suggest that the rise in inflation compensation reflects in part c
n
a
higher costs of protection against above-target inflation outcomes. In addition, some of n
i
F
the rise in inflation compensation appears related to the recent climb in oil prices, with a
notable boost after OPEC’s agreement at its November 30 meeting to cut production.
Staff models suggest that a sizable portion of the run-up in medium- and long-
term nominal yields reflected increases in real term premiums and inflation risk
premiums, which jumped immediately following the election. Part of the increase in
term premiums may stem from the upward pressure on yields arising from the expected
1 These model-based increases are somewhat larger than the revisions to the staff’s projection for
the federal funds rate based on the inertial Taylor (1999) rule at these horizons.

expansion in Treasury debt associated with deficit-financed fiscal stimulus, as well from
the increase in uncertainty about the future level of long-term rates, as evidenced by the
rise in implied volatilities from swaptions.
Respondents to the Desk’s December surveys of primary dealers and market
participants assigned a probability of near 90 percent to a rate hike in December , up from
55 percent in the November surveys. The most likely path of the target federal funds rate
was unchanged through the end of 2017 but shifted up about 25 basis points in 2018 for
both the median dealer and the median investor relative to the November surveys.
Survey respondents were also asked to rate the importance of a range of factors that
potentially contributed to the recent increase in the 10-year Treasury yield. The median
respondent in each survey rated changes in the outlook for U.S. growth and inflation as
the most important factors driving the rise in the 10-year yield, which were primarily
linked to changes in the outlook for federal government expenditures and for tax policy.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes appreciated about 5 percent since the November
FOMC meeting, boosted by expectations of stronger growth and by improved risk
sentiment, with much of the rise coming after the election.2 Share prices for the financial
sector outperformed the broader market. Bank equities, in particular, surged about
21 percent, reportedly in response to investors’ expectations of greater future bank
profitability. These expectations likely reflect in part the steepening of the yield curve s
t
n
and the possibility of a less stringent future regulatory environment. Meanwhile, stock e

volatilities at longer horizons also fell, though by less. In addition, spreads on yields of
nonfinancial corporate bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities
narrowed for both investment- and speculative-grade firms.
2 Immediately following the close of the polls, global stock prices moved down sharply; however,
these moves reversed within hours for U.S. equity prices. And despite notable price volatility, overall
market functioning was characterized as generally “orderly.”

Foreign Developments
Since the November FOMC meeting, movements in foreign financial markets
have been largely driven by U.S. developments, as investors assessed potential policy
changes resulting from the U.S. presidential election. Spillovers from U.S. markets lifted
yields and equity prices in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs). However, the U.S.
election weighed on investor sentiment toward the emerging market economies (EMEs),
where currencies depreciated and asset prices declined.
Following the U.S. election, AFE sovereign yields moved up along with U.S.
yields, albeit by less. On net, 10-year yields ended the intermeeting period 42 basis
points higher in Canada, nearly 20 basis points higher in Germany, and about 10 basis
points higher in Japan and the United Kingdom. In Italy, the “No” vote at the
constitutional referendum and expectations of the Italian prime minister’s resignation
raised concerns that the recapitalization of the Italian banking sector would become more
difficult. In the event, Italian bond and bank equity prices quickly reversed some initial
declines, and markets outside of Italy were largely unaffected.
The dollar appreciated notably against most AFE currencies as increases in U.S.
yields and policy expectations outpaced the corresponding movements abroad. In
addition to expectations for greater policy divergence, the dollar may have been boosted
by expectations for additional U.S. policy changes, such as a tax holiday on profits t s
n
e
earned abroad, which could increase U.S. firms’ repatriation of foreign cash reserves. On m
p
net, the dollar is about 3 percent stronger against the euro and about 9 percent stronger o
l
e
against the yen. In contrast, the dollar depreciated against the pound following a v
e
D
statement by the Bank of England that suggested less accommodative monetary policy
l
a
i
and following other political developments that were interpreted by investors as c
n
a
suggesting a softer Brexit. n
i
F
In the emerging market economies, markets turned down following the U.S.
election. Market participants attributed EME currency depreciation and asset price
declines to a number of factors, including higher global interest rates and the possibility
of more protectionist U.S. trade policy. EME bond and equity mutual funds (as measured
by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research) saw very large outflows as sovereign spreads
widened and equity price indexes declined. In addition, EME currencies depreciated
sharply, with the Mexican peso and Brazilian real falling by about 6 percent on net. The
Chinese renminbi also weakened against the dollar but by less than 2 percent. Capital

outflows from China have picked up again in the past few months, leading Chinese
authorities to tighten capital controls. Currency weakness prompted the Bank of Mexico
and the Central Bank of Turkey to raise their key interest rates 50 basis points, and Asian
central banks reportedly intervened in foreign exchange markets. Investor sentiment
toward oil producers improved somewhat later in the period following OPEC’s decision
to reduce supply.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS, BANKING-SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS,
AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Money market flows continued to stabilize over the intermeeting period after
experiencing outsized movements in the lead-up to the money market fund (MMF)
reforms in mid-October. Government MMFs had modest inflows, while assets under
management at prime MMFs were little changed. In addition, outstanding levels of
commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) were stable, and
holdings of CP and CDs by prime MMFs changed little. Outflows of large time deposits
from banks reversed modestly in November. Moreover, ON RRP take-up declined
substantially to an average of about $135 billion.3
Over the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds and overnight Eurodollar
rates traded within the target range.4 Overnight Treasury repo rates declined in mid-
s
t
November but generally stayed above the ON RRP offering rate. The volume of triparty n
e
m
repo trades at rates below 25 basis points stayed small, and some evidence suggests these
p
o
trades mostly reflected lenders without access to the ON RRP facility. e l
v
e
D
Rates on term money market instruments appear consistent with firming l
a
i
c
expectations for a December rate hike. In particular, the term structure of CP and other n
a
n
term money market instruments rotated up over the intermeeting period (see the box i
F
“Expectations for Money Market Rates in Coming Weeks” for a broader discussion).
3 The Desk reinvested $24 billion of maturing Treasury securities, purchased $42 billion of
15- and 30-year MBS under the reinvestment program, and has rolled $0.1 billion of expected MBS
settlements over the intermeeting period. To test operational readiness, the Desk successfully conducted
two small-value agency MBS sales operations on November 29 and December 1 and a small-value
Treasury sales operation on December 6.
4 Both the effective federal funds and Eurodollar rates averaged 41 basis points over the
intermeeting period.

Expectations for Money Market Rates in Coming Weeks
Term money market rates can be used to calculate implied forward short-term
interest rates that will prevail following the December 2016 FOMC meeting as
well as around year-end. As reported in the following tables, term money market
rates seem to embed an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at
the December FOMC meeting. Most forward rates point to only modest year-
end pressures in U.S. money markets, but there are some signs of year-end
pressures evident in global dollar funding markets based on FX basis swaps.
Table 1 calculates expected money market rates for the week after the December
FOMC meeting. Implied one-week forward rates, as shown in column 1, are
derived from the difference in spot money market rates with three- and two-
week maturities. As shown in column 2, assuming 90 percent probability of a
policy tightening and adjusting for term premiums, investors appear to anticipate
that money market rates will rise about 25 basis points after the FOMC meeting. 1
Around year-end, money market rates typically deviate from their normal levels,
as market participants try to make their balance sheets appear safer than usual.
Consistent with past years, as shown in the top panel of table 2, the OIS and
Treasury bill rates are expected to decline at year-end, while the commercial
paper rate is expected to increase. However, these anticipated moves are fairly
modest. In contrast, there have been clear signs of year-end pressures in global
funding markets. As shown in the bottom panel of table 2, one-month FX swap-
s
t
n implied basis spreads moved up sharply when their maturity dates crossed year-
e
m end, comparable in magnitude to what was observed last year.

FINANCING CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESSES, MUNICIPALITIES, AND
HOUSEHOLDS
Business and Municipal Finance
Since the November FOMC meeting, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms
remained generally accommodative. Although gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed
notably in October and November from the brisk pace in the third quarter, the decrease in
corporate bond spreads after the election, which was larger for speculative-grade bonds,
suggests that the lower issuance likely does not reflect a tightening of financial
conditions. In addition, over the past two months, growth in commercial and industrial
borrowing from banks picked up after having dipped some during the third quarter,
issuance of leveraged loans from nonbanks was robust, and CP outstanding at
nonfinancial firms increased on balance.
Third-quarter earnings for firms in the S&P 500 index are estimated to have
increased about 8 percent from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. The
improvement in earnings was generally broad based across sectors. The outlook for
corporate earnings continued to show signs of stabilization over the intermeeting period,
as projections by Wall Street analysts for year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 companies
were revised down only slightly.
s
t
Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid. The n
e
m
volume of corporate bond rating downgrades in October and November outpaced that of p
o
l
upgrades but was moderate compared with levels seen in the first half of the year. The e
v
e
six-month trailing bond default rate edged down in October, and the KMV expected year- D
l
ahead default measure also declined modestly over the intermeeting period; however, a
i
c
n
both indicators remained somewhat elevated compared with their ranges in recent years. a
n
i
F
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative on
balance. Gross issuance remained solid in October, and yields on general obligation
bonds rose somewhat more than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities over
the intermeeting period, reportedly reflecting expected reductions in the tax benefit of
municipal bonds. The credit quality of state and local governments remained stable as
the number of ratings downgrades has only moderately outpaced the number of upgrades
thus far in the fourth quarter.

Available indicators suggest that financing conditions in commercial real estate
(CRE) also remained largely accommodative. The average rate of growth of CRE loans
at banks continued to be strong in October and November. Over the intermeeting period,
spreads on CMBS narrowed a little and CMBS issuance continued to outpace the low
levels seen in the first half of 2016. The CMBS delinquency rate continued to move up
but remained low.
Overall, small business credit supply conditions were generally stable over the
past quarter. Small businesses’ credit demand was little changed but remained weak, and
anecdotal reports indicate that demand will continue to be subdued in coming quarters.
Household Finance
The interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages moved up in line with comparable-
maturity Treasury yields to its highest level since the summer of last year, although the
rate remained at a low level by historical standards and mortgage availability appeared
little changed. Partly owing to the increase in interest rates, indicators and staff models
suggest that refinance originations decreased in November and are likely to fall further in
December. Purchase originations, which are typically less sensitive to changes in interest
rates, are likely to be little changed through December.
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative, on s
t
n
balance, through the third quarter. Consumer loan balances increased at a year-over-year e
m
rate of about 6 percent through September. Consumer credit continued to be broadly p

available, although credit card loan growth at banks moderated over October and v
e

November. Moreover, extensions of new credit to subprime auto loan borrowers edged
l

down in the third quarter, and credit card lending standards appeared to remain tight for c i
n
a
subprime borrowers. Consumer ABS spreads were little changed over the intermeeting n
i
F
period, and ABS issuance so far in the fourth quarter has roughly matched its third-
quarter pace. Meanwhile, measures of consumer credit quality were little changed in the
third quarter.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). One new source of uncertainty pertains to the question
of what policy changes may follow from the recent U.S. election outcomes. Uncertainty
about policy is evident in the options-implied expected volatility associated with longer-
term Treasury securities, which has moved up since the election. The Baker, Bloom, and
Davis index of economic policy uncertainty has fluctuated widely since the election and,
as of this writing, is substantially higher than before the election. This heightened
uncertainty about policy does not appear to have spilled over to the main private-sector
measures: Options-based indexes of expected stock market volatility remain at subdued
levels, as do corporate bond spreads. Moreover, in the staff’s October quarterly
quantitative surveillance assessment, the vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system
continued to be judged as moderate.
We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted
to the downside, importantly because monetary policy appears better positioned to offset
large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones. Foreign developments and prospects
also pose net downside risks to the U.S. economy. For example, the Chinese economy
continues to face the possibility of a hard landing, and Europe remains rife with political
and economic risk. Moreover, in the event of an economic downturn, foreign authorities
would likely face similar constraints in providing policy stimulus as in the United States.
We view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for
GDP and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.
With regard to inflation, we do not view the current level of uncertainty as
unusually high. We see important risks to inflation on both the upside and the downside,
y
and we view those risks as roughly balanced. To the downside, some survey-based t

p rojected to be operating above its long-run potential, inflation may increase more than
the staff expects, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear
effects of economic slack on inflation.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario explores the
consequences of continued subdued labor productivity growth, while the second scenario
couples this low productivity growth with faster increases in wages. The third scenario
considers the effects of a future fiscal stimulus that is larger and that has a different
composition than in the staff baseline. By contrast, in the fourth scenario, the tax cut
assumed by the staff in the baseline does not materialize. In the fifth scenario, we
analyze the effects of an expansion of credit supply by the U.S. financial sector. In the
sixth scenario, we consider the possibility that U.S. policy normalization leads to a much
stronger appreciation of the dollar and to financial turbulence in the EMEs. The final
scenario analyzes the effect of a banking crisis in Europe.
The first four scenarios are simulated in the FRB/US model. The fifth scenario
uses a version of the Gertler–Karadi DSGE model, which attempts to describe explicitly
the behavior of leveraged financial intermediaries.1 The sixth and seventh scenarios are
run in the multicountry SIGMA model. For the two fiscal scenarios, we assume different
adjustments to the intercept in the inertial policy rule used in the baseline, as we will
describe in further detail. In the other five scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed
by the same rule as in the baseline. In all cases, we assume that the size and composition
of the SOMA portfolio follow the baseline paths.
Weaker Productivity
Labor productivity growth has averaged only about ½ percent per year over the
past six years. In the baseline projection, productivity is assumed to rise at an average
annual rate of 1 percent in 2017 and 2018. However, the recent sluggish productivity

gains may persist longer than we envision in the baseline. In this scenario, lower trend t

t otal factor productivity growth is assumed to cause labor productivity growth to remain
at only ½ percent per year over the next two years before moving up to the baseline pace.
The slower growth rate of productivity results in real GDP growth that is
½ percentage point lower than in the baseline. The revised expectations about future
productivity depress aggregate demand by a little more than aggregate supply over the
intermediate term as households recognize the reduction in their permanent income; as a
result, labor market conditions deteriorate, yielding an unemployment trajectory that is a
bit higher than the baseline path.2 Inflation reaches 2 percent by 2019, reflecting the
increase in firms’ marginal costs from weaker productivity. The path for the federal
funds rate is essentially unchanged from the baseline, as the effect of a slightly higher
path for the unemployment rate is offset by mildly higher inflation.
Weaker Productivity and Faster Wage Growth
In the baseline, although the unemployment rate is persistently below the natural
rate of unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consistent with the modest response of
prices to economic activity seen in recent years. However, there is considerable
uncertainty about the relationship between resource slack and wage setting, and it is
possible that wages may prove more sensitive to a tight labor market than we have
assumed and that the resulting higher wages may pass through into higher prices. In this
scenario, wage inflation responds more to economic slack than assumed in the baseline,
resulting in larger gains in labor compensation. Additionally, as in the previous scenario,
we assume that the pickup in labor productivity growth projected by the staff in 2017 and
2018 does not materialize.3
Higher wages and lower productivity imply higher marginal costs of production,
and in the FRB/US model, these higher costs pass through to price inflation.
Accordingly, PCE prices accelerate more than in the baseline and more than in the
preceding scenario, rising 2.7 percent in 2019. Similar to the preceding scenario, the
weaker path of labor productivity holds down real GDP growth. The steeper path of

i nflation turns out to be the stronger influence on the federal funds rate, which moves up
½ percentage point more than in the baseline.
Larger Fiscal Stimulus
In the baseline projection, the staff is assuming a cut in personal income taxes
equal to 1 percent of GDP debuting in 2017:Q3. In this scenario, we study the effect of a
fiscal stimulus that is larger and that has a different composition: In addition to the tax
cut considered in the baseline, we assume an increase in government purchases equal to
1 percent of GDP, phased in from 2017:Q3 onward.4 We assume that half of the
additional government spending is directed to public infrastructure.5 In the long run, the
intercept of the policy rule converges to a level that is 25 basis points higher than in the
baseline, and the 10-year Treasury rate is revised up about twice as much as in the
baseline.
Real GDP growth is 0.3 percentage point higher than in the baseline, on average,
in 2018 and 2019, reflecting the effect on aggregate demand of the additional government
spending. The unemployment rate follows a lower path, bottoming out at 3.7 percent in
2019. The tighter resource utilization puts upward pressure on inflation, which reaches
2.4 percent by the end of 2021.6 As a result, the federal funds rate follows a steeper path
than in the baseline, passing 5 percent in 2021.
No Fiscal Stimulus
There is substantial uncertainty regarding the degree of possible additional fiscal
stimulus. This scenario posits that the tax cut assumed in the baseline does not
materialize. As a consequence, we also unwind the adjustments to the rule for setting the
4 In particular, we assume that the additional government spending is phased in over a four-year
period. Spending returns gradually to the baseline thereafter.
5 To capture possible supply-side effects of additional government spending, we assume that
y government investment in physical capital has an annual rate of return of 7 percent, consistent with the
t
n
i estimate in Congressional Budget Office (2016), The Macroeconomic and Budgetary Effects of Federal
a
t Investment (Washington: CBO, June), www.cbo.gov/publication/51628. This rate of return, together with
r
e the size and gradual implementation of government spending on infrastructure assumed in this scenario,
c
n implies only a negligible additional effect on output.
U
6 In this scenario and the next one, the responses of inflation are likely larger than the revisions

that the staff would implement using its judgmental apparatus, as inflation in FRB/US generally moves

f ederal funds rate and to the long-term interest rate term premium made in the baseline
projection.7
Without the tax cut, real GDP growth is slightly weaker than in the baseline and
unemployment is higher; by 2020, the difference in the unemployment rate relative to the
baseline reaches ¼ percentage point. In addition, inflation follows a lower trajectory.8
These developments—as well as the adjustment to the policy rule—imply a lower path of
the federal funds rate, which is 0.7 percentage point below the baseline at the end
of 2021.
Financial-Sector Expansion
In the third quarter of 2016 U.S. banks reported strong profits relative to the
recent past, and share prices for U.S. financial intermediaries have increased more than
30 percent in the second half of the year, turning what had been a year-to-date decline
into a gain of more than 20 percent.9 In this scenario, we consider the possibility that
investor sentiment toward the financial sector continues to improve.
In particular, we calibrate positive financial shocks that induce a 20 percent
increase in the market capitalization of the financial sector, compared with the baseline,
over the first two quarters of 2017. In the model used to generate this scenario, the net
worth of financial-sector firms is a key determinant of their ability to provide funds to
nonfinancial firms, so that a higher value increases credit supply and leads, in turn, to
higher investment. As a consequence, GDP rises 2¾ percent over the next four quarters,
compared with 2¼ percent in the baseline, and the unemployment rate decreases to
4.1 percent by 2018. In this scenario, the movement of inflation is limited in part because
of a flat Phillips curve estimated in the model, but also because higher investment causes
downward pressure on marginal costs by increasing the marginal product of labor.
Consequently, the path of the federal funds rate is only a touch higher than in the
baseline.10

S tronger Dollar and EME Financial Turbulence
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate about 5 percent over the
forecast period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster than markets currently
appear to expect. The normalization of U.S. monetary policy, however, could well cause
a more pronounced and persistent appreciation of the dollar, especially if higher U.S.
interest rates generate financial turbulence in vulnerable EMEs. In this scenario, we
assume that the broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the end of next
year and that EME corporate borrowing spreads rise substantially in the face of persistent
capital outflows from EMEs. Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions in EMEs,
EME central banks are assumed to tighten monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure
on inflation arising from the depreciation of their currencies. All told, foreign GDP
growth runs, on average, about ¾ percentage point below the baseline over the next
two years.
The stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth depress U.S. real net exports.
Consequently, U.S. real GDP growth moderates to just 1.5 percent in the second half of
2017, about ¾ percentage point less than in the baseline. Lower import prices and
weaker economic activity cause core PCE inflation to be, on average, only 1¼ percent in
2017. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, rising to about
2½ percent by the end of 2019.
Banking Crisis in Europe
Europe’s banking sector has many underlying vulnerabilities, including tepid
earnings prospects, weak capital positions, and high levels of nonperforming loans.
Accordingly, we think there is some chance that a major European bank will experience a
severe deterioration in its liquidity and capital conditions, requiring the bank to be
resolved and restructured. The need to resolve a systemically important European bank,
especially if the process is messy, could well precipitate a loss in confidence in Europe’s
banking system more generally and in the authorities’ abilities to address these problems.
In this scenario, we consider the possibility that a resolution of a major European bank
y leads to a banking crisis that produces sizable adverse financial spillovers to both the
t
n
a i United States and the rest of the world.

Specifically, this scenario assumes that financial conditions in Europe tighten

s preads rise more than 100 basis points, and household borrowing spreads also rise
noticeably. With little scope for the ECB to reduce long-term sovereign yields, Europe
falls into recession, with GDP bottoming out about 4 percent below the baseline by the
end of 2018. The crisis has adverse spillovers to the United States: U.S. corporate bond
spreads rise about 50 basis points, while flight-to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar
to appreciate 5 percent.
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. net exports to fall
relative to the baseline. U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the baseline as a
result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions. All told, U.S. real GDP
growth moderates to just under 1.5 percent in 2017 and 2018. The U.S. unemployment
rate runs at nearly 5 percent in 2018, ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.
Lower resource utilization and falling import prices reduce U.S. core inflation to
1 percent in the second half of 2017. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path,
reaching only 2¼ percent at the end of 2019, compared with 3¼ percent in the baseline.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that y
t
n
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time. a i

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
