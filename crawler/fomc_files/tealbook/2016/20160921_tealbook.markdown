Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&&
ll
ee
vv
ee
Since the July Tealbook, incoming information about economic activity has been DD
nn
close to our expectations, on balance, and corroborates our earlier view that the pace of oo
cc
EE
economic growth is picking up in the second half of the year. The July and August
cc
ii
tt
employment reports, taken together, indicated slightly more improvement in labor market ss
ee
mm
conditions than we had projected in July. On the spending side, real GDP growth in the oo
DD
first half is estimated to have been weaker than earlier anticipated, but growth in private
domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which we view as a better indicator of the underlying
momentum in aggregate demand—has been solid and about in line with our previous
projection. The GDP shortfall reflected weaker inventory investment, which we expect
to be mostly unwound by the end of the year. All told, our forecast for real GDP growth
over the year as a whole is nearly unrevised at 1¾ percent.
Beyond this year, our projection for real GDP growth is a touch weaker than our
previous forecast, reflecting a slightly slower assumed pace of potential output growth.
We expect real GDP growth to increase to a 2½ percent pace in 2017 and then to edge
down to around 2 percent in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019—rates still sufficient to
generate some further tightening of resource utilization. At the end of 2018 and in 2019,
real GDP is forecast to be 1½ percent above our estimate of its potential.
Correspondingly, we expect the unemployment rate to fall to 4¼ percent, ¾ percentage
point below our estimate of its natural rate. These assessments are very close to our
expectations in the July Tealbook.
The inflation forecast is also essentially unrevised from the July Tealbook. We
continue to project that PCE prices will increase 1.2 percent in the second half of the
year, similar to the first half, as a step-down in core inflation is offset by an acceleration
in food and energy prices. Over the following couple of years, PCE inflation is projected
to move up, reaching 1.9 percent in 2019, as the effects of earlier energy and import price
declines fade and as resource utilization continues to tighten in an environment of
reasonably stable long-run inflation expectations.
We discuss our assessment of the risks to real economic activity and inflation in
the Risks and Uncertainty section.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&&
ll
ee
vv
ee The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is about in line with the median
DD
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip
nn
oo consensus forecast in 2016, and it is slightly stronger than that of the Blue Chip in
cc
EE 2017. (The SPF forecast is released quarterly and is about a month old; we await the
cc
ii next release on November 14.) The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is
tt
ss
ee slightly above the others in 2016 and in line with the Blue Chip in 2017. The staff’s
mm
oo projection for CPI inflation is slightly below the outside forecasters in 2016 and 2017.
DD
The staff’s projections for total and core PCE price inflation are also somewhat
lower than the SPF in 2016 and 2017.

results for PCE price inflation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input
from about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to
both surveys.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&&

vv

DD
June FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection with the
nn
oo one we presented in the June Tealbook.
cc
EE
cc
ii Over the projection period through 2019, the cumulative growth of real GDP is slightly lower than
tt
ss
ee in the June forecast. However, with potential output growth also having been revised a little
mm
oo lower over the medium term (as well as in the longer run), the output gap is unchanged through
DD
2018 and a bit higher in 2019. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate is unrevised through 2018
and, at 4.2 percent, a tenth lower at the end of 2019.
The staff’s forecast for PCE price inflation—both total and core—is essentially unchanged from
June. We continue to project that inflation will move up in the coming years, with total PCE price
inflation reaching 1.9 percent by 2019.
We have lowered the assumed longer-run value of the real equilibrium federal funds rate to
0.75 percent in this forecast, down from 1.0 percent in the June Tealbook. The intercept-adjusted
inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline forecast (introduced in the June Tealbook)
prescribes a path of the nominal federal funds rate that rises a bit more slowly and reaches an
average of 3.19 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, 15 basis points less than in our June
projection—primarily reflecting the effect of the lower longer-run equilibrium rate.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS uu tt
OO
&&
Monetary Policy
ll
ee
vv
 In the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use to mechanically set the federal ee
DD
funds rate in our projection, we lowered the real long-run equilibrium rate (r*) nn
oo
cc
from 1 percent to ¾ percent.1 The path of the time-varying intercept EE
cc
ii
converges to the new long-run value for r* on the same time frame as ss tt
ee
mm
before—namely, by the end of 2018. However, these adjustments are small,
oo
DD
and the resulting path of the federal funds rate is close to the one in the July
Tealbook. All told, the current rule calls for the federal funds rate to increase
about 85 basis points per year over the projection period and to average
3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, about 45 basis points above its
neutral level.
 As in the July Tealbook, we assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at
its current level until the third quarter of next year and then begin to contract
as the proceeds from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 The projected path of the 10-year Treasury yield is lower than in the July
projection, mostly reflecting our assessment that the factors holding down
term premiums will be more persistent than we had previously assumed. We
revised down the medium-term path of the term premium between 15 and
40 basis points and revised down its assumed long-run value 10 basis points.2
Nevertheless, our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to
rise significantly over the medium term, as the 10-year valuation window
moves through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and term
premiums increase very gradually toward more normal levels.
 Investment-grade corporate bond spreads continued to trend down since late
July, leading us to revise down our projection for investment-grade corporate

Parameters of the Staff Judgmental Forecast” by Cristina Fuentes-Albero and Ashley Wang, which
discusses our adjustments to the assumed long-run values of the real equilibrium interest rate, the term
premium, and potential GDP growth.

Equity Prices and Home Prices nn
oo
cc
EE
 Stock prices in the current quarter were revised down a touch compared with
cc
ii
tt
the forecast in the July Tealbook, reflecting recent decreases in broad equity ss
ee
mm
indexes. Equity prices are projected to rise at an average annual rate of oo
DD
1¾ percent over the medium term.
 Recent data on house prices were a bit softer than we had expected, leading us
to slightly lower the projected increase for 2016 to 5½ percent. Our
projection for annual increases averaging 3¾ percent from 2017 through 2019
is close to pace in the July Tealbook.
Fiscal Policy
 We continue to assume that discretionary policy actions at all levels of
government will boost real GDP growth almost ½ percentage point this year
and next, with smaller contributions in 2018 and 2019. We assume that a
continuing resolution will be passed by the Congress to fund discretionary
federal spending and that a shutdown of the government will be avoided
this fall.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign real GDP growth is estimated to have slowed to an annual rate of less
than 1 percent in the second quarter, held down by transitory contractions in
Canada and Mexico. We expect growth to bounce back to 2½ percent in the
second half of this year, the same as in the July Tealbook. Although the
outlook for EME growth has weakened slightly, we pared back the negative
effects we expect from Brexit on the U.K. and euro-area economies. After
this year, foreign growth is projected to edge up toward 2¾ percent for the
remainder of the forecast, supported in part by accommodative monetary
policy abroad.
 The broad nominal dollar is ½ percent lower in the near term than in the July
Tealbook in light of dollar depreciation that has occurred against the

ss
ee
mm o We now assume the dollar will appreciate against the renminbi at a

DD
2 percent annual rate until the end of 2016 and then at a 1 percent pace
through the end of the forecast period. Previously, we had assumed the
dollar would depreciate at a 2 percent pace starting in the second half
of 2017.
o We now assume the dollar will increase 3 percent against all floating
currencies for each 100 basis points of policy rate surprise, consistent with
the experience of the past seven years. We had previously assumed a
sensitivity of 2.5 percent for AFE currencies and about 2 percent for
floating EME currencies.
Oil Prices
 Over the past few months, spot oil prices have fluctuated within a range from
about $40 to just over $50 per barrel; they currently stand at $47 per barrel,
unchanged relative to the close of the July Tealbook. Futures prices are down
about $1 per barrel since the close of the July Tealbook, with the December
2019 Brent futures prices currently at $56 per barrel.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
Real GDP growth is expected to pick up from a 1 percent pace in the first half of
the year to a 2½ percent pace in the second half, reflecting a modest step-up in PDFP
growth and a more sizable upswing in inventory investment.3
3 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” the
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at
2.6 percent, is close to the staff’s judgmental projection of 2.7 percent in the third quarter.

 Recent information on consumer spending has been slightly stronger, on uu

balance, than we expected in our previous projection.4 Our forecast of real &&

PCE growth of about 3 percent in the third quarter also reflects upbeat ee

consumer sentiment, continued solid gains in employment and household DD

income, and past increases in household wealth.5 oo

 In contrast, incoming data on residential construction have been weaker than tt
ii
ss
ee
mm
we had previously forecast. Single-family permits—which we think are the
oo
DD
best indicator of the underlying trend in residential construction—had been
moving essentially sideways since late last year and then declined sharply in
July. As a result, we marked down our forecast for residential investment in
the near term and now anticipate declines in each of the second through fourth
quarters of this year.
 We expect business fixed investment to remain relatively subdued in the
second half of 2016, although not as dismal as over the past several quarters.
After declining in the first half of the year, investment in equipment and
intangibles (E&I) appears to be on track to rise about 2 percent in the current
quarter. The collapse in investment in drilling and mining structures is
expected to end next quarter, as the effects of earlier declines in crude oil
prices dissipate. For other types of nonresidential structures, recent indicators
suggest investment has picked up in the current quarter, in contrast to the
decline we had expected in the July Tealbook.
 The staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system points to no major inventory
imbalances outside the energy sector. Partly on that basis, we expect
investment in business inventories to step up in the second half of the year,
especially as PDFP growth remains solid.
 Net exports, after contributing a small positive amount to GDP growth in the
first half of the year, are projected to subtract about ¼ percentage point from
real GDP growth in the second half, as imports increase and exports continue
4 A first estimate of retail sales for August will be released on Thursday, September 15, the day
after Tealbook A closes.
5 Another indicator of income growth is a Census Bureau report released on September 13, 2016,
showing that real median household income rose more than 5 percent in 2015, the first increase since 2007.
In addition, the poverty rate declined 1.2 percentage points, to 13.5 percent.

 Manufacturing production increased substantially in July, but available EE

physical product data and readings on production worker hours for August tt ii

suggest that production likely declined last month. Taking a longer view, mm
oo
DD
manufacturing output has been little changed, on net, since the end of 2014, as
weak export demand and the spillovers from the decline in oil and gas drilling
have weighed on industrial activity. We expect factory output to continue on
this flat trajectory over the second half of the year, consistent with recent
mixed readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing
surveys.
After this year, real GDP growth is projected to step up to 2½ percent in 2017,
mostly reflecting increases in the pace of both residential and business investment as well
as a waning drag from the dollar appreciation since mid-2014. GDP growth eases to
2 percent in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019 as monetary policy gradually normalizes and
the stimulus from fiscal policy diminishes.
 Our projection for real GDP growth in 2017 through 2019 is a touch weaker
than in the July Tealbook, reflecting a slightly slower assumed pace of
potential output growth. Other changes in key financial and foreign
background factors were essentially offsetting, as the path of longer-term
interest rates is somewhat lower, while the path for the dollar is a little higher.
 If long-term rates fail to rise as much as is assumed in the baseline, then real
GDP growth may be stronger and the unemployment rate lower than the
Tealbook forecast. (For more on this possibility, see the alternative view box
“A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum” and the accompanying scenario in
the Risks and Uncertainty section.)
 With GDP growth expected to outpace our estimate of potential growth over
the medium term, real GDP at the end of 2018 and 2019 is projected to be
1½ percent above its potential, essentially the same as in the July Tealbook.

Alternative View: A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum
&&
ll
ee
vv
ee A well-known theorem in international monetary economics is the impossible trinity: A
DD
country cannot simultaneously have (1) a fixed exchange rate, (2) free capital mobility,
nn
oo and (3) independent monetary policy. Hélène Rey (2013) argued that the globalized
cc
EE financial system has transformed the impossible trinity into an “impossible binity”:
cc
ii With or without a fixed exchange rate, a small open economy cannot control its
tt
ss
ee monetary conditions as long as its capital account is open.1 In this discussion, I take
mm
oo Rey’s line of thought a step further and consider the possibility that, regardless of the
DD
exchange rate regime, no country with free capital mobility, even a large one, can fully
control its own monetary and financial conditions in today’s globalized financial
system. As I will show, some evidence for this theory has already manifested itself as
the “Greenspan conundrum,” a phenomenon in which long-term interest rates failed to
rise in response to the steep monetary policy tightening from 2004 to 2006.
In principle, monetary policy independence and flexible exchange rates could afford a
central bank considerable influence over interest rates across the maturity spectrum
even if resulting in substantial divergence in long-term interest rates relative to other
economies. For example, the Federal Reserve might communicate that it expected to
tighten policy while other central banks sent no such signal, which could cause long-
term U.S. interest rates to rise relative to those abroad. Under the assumption of
uncovered interest parity (UIP), investors would have no reason to pile into U.S. assets
and thus “arbitrage away” this higher yield, because the higher U.S. yield would be
offset by an expected dollar depreciation that was large enough to equalize expected
returns across assets.
This UIP-based rationale for sizable cross-country long-term interest rate differentials
seems belied both by the well-known failure of UIP and by historical experience,
however. In particular, during the 2004–06 U.S. tightening cycle, a large interest rate
gap opened between the U.S. economy and other advanced economies, especially
Japan, creating a large carry-trade opportunity. If UIP held, the carry trade would be
unprofitable on average because any gains from the interest rate differential would be
offset by a depreciation of the dollar. In reality, this prediction failed and the U.S. dollar
appreciation and large capital inflows continued, driving down long-term yields and
leading to the Greenspan conundrum.
The Greenspan conundrum can be shown econometrically. The figures on the next
page show the impulse response functions from a bivariate vector autoregression
using the monthly federal funds rate and 10-year Treasury bond rate over two periods,
1962 to 1995 and 1996 to 2006. The two figures show the impulse responses of the

Greenspan conundrum does not necessarily mean that U.S. monetary policy is ss

powerless. However, to the extent that monetary policy also works by affecting the mm
oo
levels of various long-term borrowing rates, the conundrum suggests that the Federal DD
Reserve might have lost a substantial part of the control of its monetary and financial
conditions, at least through the federal funds rate. In fact, between the second half of
2004 and the first half of 2006, the federal funds rate was raised as much as 450 basis
points. However, this steep increase in the short-term interest rate failed to prevent
market participants from overinvesting in long-term U.S. assets.
In today’s globalized financial system, the short-term interest rate of a local financial
market cannot perfectly control the funding conditions faced by investors because
money can be raised in any funding currency provided that market risk appetite is
strong enough. As the federal funds rate rises over the next few years, the longer-term
Treasury rate may not rise as much as is predicted in the baseline. Dollar appreciation
due to capital inflows may not be enough to offset the stimulus effect of the low long-
term rates. This scenario suggests the importance of more direct control of longer-
term interest rates—for example, via the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program.
In the event that the U.S. economy faces significant upward pressure on inflation, the
Federal Reserve could consider a “reverse LSAP” policy.

Labor market conditions have continued to improve this year, albeit more slowly

DD
nn conditions improved a little more than expected in the July Tealbook.

ii  Total nonfarm payroll employment is currently reported to have increased
tt
ss
mm ee 151,000 in August after having risen 275,000 in July.6 We anticipate that total
oo
DD payrolls will increase 175,000 per month, on average, over the remainder of
this year, 10,000 faster than in our July projection.
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in August,
unchanged since June and down only 0.1 percentage point since December of
last year. The labor force participation rate was unchanged in August and has
increased about 0.2 percentage point since last December. We expect the
unemployment rate to remain at 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and the
participation rate to decline 0.1 percentage point by the end of the year,
roughly in line with its downward trend. These forecasts are quite close to the
July Tealbook projections.
 We continue to estimate that little slack remains in the labor market. In the
current quarter, our projection puts the unemployment rate 0.1 percentage
point below our estimate of its natural rate, while the participation rate and the
employment-to-population ratio are close to their trends. In addition, we view
the share of employees working part time for economic reasons, which has
been little changed since late last year, as slightly elevated and likely
representing a small source of labor underutilization.
 Taken at face value, the labor market conditions index (LMCI) points to a
small deterioration in labor market conditions so far this year, whereas the
staff’s assessment is that labor market conditions have been gradually
improving, though at a slower pace than last year.
6 As we noted a year ago, in each year from 2009 to 2014, the initially reported changes in
nonfarm payrolls for August were subsequently revised up, with an average revision of about 75,000. In
contrast, the payroll gain in August 2015 was subsequently revised down 20,000. Given this information,
we have penciled in an upward revision of 30,000 to the August payroll gain, but this point estimate has a
wide confidence interval.

projection.
The medium-term outlook for the labor market is close to our July projection.

for 2016 as a whole to about 145,000 in 2018 and 110,000 in 2019. We
estimate that the pace of payroll employment growth consistent with
unchanged labor utilization is between 85,000 and 115,000 per month. (For a
discussion of this calculation, see the box “The Neutral Pace of Payroll
Employment Gains.”)
 We continue to estimate that conditions will tighten further in the next couple
of years.
o By the end of 2019, the unemployment rate is projected to be
4.2 percent—0.8 percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate.
o In addition, we project the labor force participation rate to edge down a
touch more slowly than its trend over the medium term, as sustained job
gains and rising wages continue to draw individuals into the labor force
while also slowing outflows. As a result, the participation rate is projected
to be about 0.2 percentage point above our estimate of its trend level at the
end of 2019.

The Neutral Pace of Payroll Employment Gains
A useful benchmark for evaluating the strength of monthly payroll employment gains
(measured in the establishment survey) is its “neutral pace”—the number of jobs
needed per month to holdlabor market conditionsunchanged,withtheunemployment
rate remaining at its current level and the labor force participation rate (LFPR) declining
at its trendrate. The key determinants of this neutral pace are the trend rate of labor
force growth and the difference between monthly job gains in the payroll and
householdsurveys. This discussion explains how assumptions about these two factors
influenceestimates for the neutral pace of payrolljob gains.
Labor force growth is determined by population growth and changes in the LFPR. The
table below provides estimates of employment gains needed to hold the
unemployment rate unchanged at 4.9 percent over the next year,assumingthat the
populationgrows1percent annually (about the same as its recent five-year average and
in line with the staff's expectation for the next few years) and allowing for different
assumptions about the annualchangeintheLFPR.1 The estimates in the first row
assume that employment gains in the payroll and household surveys are the same on
average (an assumption that will be relaxed later). With these assumptions, the
monthlypace needed to hold the unemployment rate unchangedrangesfrom125,000
jobs when the LFPR is flat to 45,000jobs when the LFPR falls 0.4percentage point
per year.
Employment gains, however, sometimes differ substantially between the two surveys,
resulting in a different pace than what is shown in the first row of the table. For
example, during an expansion, employment gains in the establishment survey typically
exceed those in the household survey.2 The pace of job gains needed to hold the

would add or subtract about 25,000 jobs per month .
2 As shown in Abraham and others (2013), two important factors contributing to faster
employmentgains in the establishment survey than in the household survey during an expansion are
an increase in short-duration jobs (which are more likely to be captured in the payroll survey than in
the household survey) and a decrease in off-the-books jobs (which could be captured by the

Despite the cyclical regularity of the difference in employment gains between the two
surveys, the realized difference can vary significantly at times. For example, as shown
in the figure, over the past few years, the 3-month moving average of the difference in
monthly employment gains between the two surveys has ranged from plus 450,000 to
minus 350,000, and the 12-month moving average of the difference has ranged from
plus 150,000 to minus 100,000. As a result, the neutral pace of payroll job gains can also
vary widely.

 Data on core PCE prices through July are in line with our expectations that DD
core inflation, on a quarterly basis, will slow from an average annual rate of
1.9 percent in the first half of the year to a 1.3 percent pace in the second
half.7 This step-down reflects a deceleration in prices in some volatile
categories that showed outsized gains early in the year as well as some
residual seasonality.8
 PCE energy prices declined in July but are expected to edge up, on balance,
over the second half of the year, as crude oil prices are projected to rise.
 Consumer food price inflation is expected to continue running below the pace
of core inflation over the second half of the year: PCE food prices declined in
July, and food commodity prices have moved down further as harvests are
turning out to be more bountiful than previously forecast.
 Core import prices are projected to increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent in
the third quarter, an elevated pace that reflects recent dollar depreciation.
With the dollar expected to appreciate, we project these prices will rise at a
more moderate ¾ percent pace through the rest of the forecast period.
 Recent readings on longer-term inflation expectations have remained
relatively stable on balance. Expected PCE inflation over the next 10 years
from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional
Forecasters remained at 2 percent. The median inflation expectation over the
next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey, at 2.5 percent in August, was
7 Data for the CPI in August will be released on Friday, September 16.
8 For example, nonmarket services prices, a category from which we take little signal for future
price changes, climbed at a 4 percent pace in the first half of this year compared with a 3¼ percent increase
in 2015. In addition, some categories of goods showed large increases earlier this year that we expect to be
transitory, such as an outsized jump in jewelry prices.

July Tealbook. Core PCE price inflation is expected to move up to 1.9 percent by 2019, mm

primarily reflecting the waning restraint from earlier declines in energy and import prices
along with a further tightening in resource utilization. With consumer food and energy
prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices after this year, we expect total
PCE price inflation to run close to the same pace as core inflation over the next few years
and to reach 1.9 percent in 2019.
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our core inflation projection has been
revised up in 2016 largely because of readings in the first couple months of
the year that were higher than we expected. Core inflation has receded over
the past few months, however, and the projections for 2017 and 2018 are little
changed.
The incoming data on hourly labor compensation have been mixed. We expect
compensation per hour to pick up a little over the projection period but anticipate that the
employment cost index (ECI) will remain near its current pace of increase.9
 Compensation per hour in the business sector is estimated to have declined at
an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter of the year, a notable downward
revision to the estimate we had at the time of the July Tealbook. Data through
July suggest that wage growth has since picked up, and we expect the growth
in compensation per hour to move up from an average pace of about
2½ percent over the past eight quarters to 3¼ percent in 2019.
 Over the 12 months ending in June, the ECI for private workers rose
2.4 percent, a pace we expect to continue through the end of the medium term.
9 Increases in the ECI tend to be much less pro-cyclical than the increases in business-sector
compensation per hour.

earnings, has moved up from around 3 percent to 3½ percent over the past

DD
year and a half. However, the pace of increases in this measure remains
below pre-recession levels.10
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 Our assumption regarding the natural rate of unemployment in the longer run
remains at 5.0 percent. The growth rate of potential GDP in the longer run
has been revised down 0.2 percentage point since the July Tealbook to
1.7 percent.
 The long-run value of the real federal funds rate has been revised down from
1 percent to ¾ percent since the July Tealbook, which is also reflected in the
long-run value of the 10-year Treasury rate.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by 2022.
 With output running above its potential and inflation at the Committee’s
2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate is about ¾ percentage point
above its long-run value of 2¾ percent in 2020 and 2021, then moves back
toward its long-run value thereafter.
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates further and
rises at an annual rate of 1.4 percent and 1.3 percent in 2020 and 2021,
10 The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker is calculated using microdata from the Current
Population Survey. It is the 3-month moving average of the median 12-month change in the hourly wage
for all individuals who are employed both in the current month and in the same month one year earlier
(though not necessarily at all times between those two dates or at the same employer).

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Foreign real GDP growth slowed from a 2½ percent pace in the first quarter to
less than 1 percent in the second—its slowest pace since the Global Financial
Crisis (GFC). GDP contracted in both Mexico and Canada—countries that represent
40 percent of our U.S. export-weighted foreign aggregate—as the decline in U.S.
manufacturing production hit economic activity in Mexico and as wildfires disrupted oil
production in Canada. Excluding Mexico and Canada, foreign GDP growth declined
only slightly, to 2¼ percent, from 2½ percent in the first quarter.
k
o
o
l
We expect foreign growth to bounce back from its second-quarter pothole to t
u
O
2½ percent in the second half of this year. Oil production recently rebounded in Canada,
&
and we expect the projected pickup in U.S. manufacturing to support Mexican activity. e l
v
e
Moreover, global financial conditions have improved since the July Tealbook, in part D
n
reflecting early indications that the near-term effects on the United Kingdom and euro o
c
E
area of the British vote for EU exit, or Brexit, are smaller than feared. However, after
l
’
t
this rebound in the second half, we see little further strengthening, with growth abroad n
I
edging up to a pace of only 2¾ percent, well below its pre-GFC trend. Relative to the
July Tealbook, our projection is up a touch in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs)
and down slightly in the emerging market economies (EMEs).
Aggregate AFE inflation has remained near an annual pace of 1¼ percent in
recent months, while measures of inflation expectations across the AFEs continue to run
at persistently low levels. Moreover, although we lowered our estimates of potential
output growth since the GFC, we still have output gaps closing only slowly in the AFEs,
especially in the euro area. Accordingly, we expect AFE inflation to edge up to just
above 1½ percent over the forecast period. With inflation low and growth tepid,
monetary policy in the AFEs will remain highly accommodative for the duration of the
forecast period.
Expectations that interest rates will be “low for long” in the advanced economies
are already generating financial market responses that could have implications for the
outlook—notably, there has been greater investor interest in EMEs, where equity prices
are generally up, and sovereign and corporate bond spreads are nearing post-GFC lows.
Given already high corporate leverage and slowing trend GDP growth, we do not expect
the favorable financial market developments in EMEs to substantially boost growth in
Page 41 of 100

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) September 14, 2016
these economies. In our baseline, U.S. monetary policy normalization leads to some,
albeit muted, reversal of buoyant EME financial conditions. However, we are still
cognizant of the downside risk that U.S. monetary policy tightening could prove
destabilizing for EMEs, weighing on global growth and leading to a more sizable and
sustained appreciation of the dollar than we are assuming in our baseline projection; we
explore this risk in the “Stronger Dollar” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Some other (now familiar) downside risks to the global economy have not gone
away. Notably, although we continue to project a relatively orderly transition to slower
growth in China, the risk of a financial crisis and severe slowdown remains significant.
k
o
o In addition, some longer-term risks associated with Brexit also remain, in particular the
l
t
u risk that other EU countries follow the precedent set by Brexit and, in doing so, prompt a
O
& breakup of the euro area. There are also some upside risks to our foreign growth outlook:
l
e
v Highly accommodative monetary policies, diminishing fiscal pressure, and ongoing
e
D
balance sheet repair could spur faster growth in AFEs, while Latin American countries
n
o
could shake off their malaise faster than we currently envision and EMEs more generally
c
E
l could benefit from easier financial conditions. The implications of this upside are
’
t
n
I explored in the “Faster Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar” scenario in the Risks and
Uncertainty section.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Canada. Second-quarter GDP growth was negative 1.6 percent, ¾ percentage
point lower than estimated in the July Tealbook, and down from 2.5 percent in
the first quarter. The second-quarter surprise was largely due to a greater-
than-anticipated effect on the energy sector from the May wildfires.
Accordingly, we now expect third-quarter growth to rebound to 3½ percent, as
oil production had already started to recover in June. However, other recent
indicators—such as the manufacturing PMI, which is only modestly
expansionary, and the unemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent—
suggest that the underlying pace of growth is moderate. We thus project that
GDP growth will step down to 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter and remain at
that pace through 2017 before edging down further to a near-potential pace of
1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period. The expansion should be
supported by ongoing accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and a

weak Canadian dollar. In this context, we continue to expect the Bank of
Canada to begin removing monetary accommodation in late 2017.
• United Kingdom. Real GDP expanded 2.4 percent in the second quarter, up
from 1.8 percent in the previous quarter. Recent indicators—such as retail
sales in July as well as confidence and PMIs through August—suggest that the
U.K. economy showed more resilience than had been anticipated just
following the Brexit referendum. Financial conditions have also been better
than expected and were likely supported by a stimulus package announced by
the Bank of England (BOE) in early August. Accordingly, we marked up the
k
outlook for growth almost ½ percentage point through mid-2017 relative to o
o
l
t
the July Tealbook. Even so, the surge in political and economic uncertainty u
O
due to the Brexit vote should still exert considerable drag on business &
l
investment and consumer spending. We thus project that GDP growth will e
v
e
step down to a 1¼ percent pace in the second half of this year before rising D
n
back to 1¾ percent by 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policy o
c
E
and a reduction in uncertainty as more details are known about the
l
’
t
n
Brexit process. I
Inflation should rise from 0.8 percent in the second quarter to almost
2½ percent by year-end, reflecting the effects of the depreciation of the pound
in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. As these effects wane, inflation should
edge down to 2 percent by 2018. In line with this assessment, the BOE will
look through this surge in inflation, as it has stated. Indeed, the BOE
announced a large stimulus package in August: a 25 basis point reduction in
the policy rate to 0.25 percent; a £60 billion expansion of the asset purchase
scheme for U.K. government bonds, which will increase the stock of BOE
holdings from £375 billion to £435 billion; purchases of up to £10 billion of
U.K. corporate bonds; and a new Term Funding Scheme that provides long-
term funding for banks at interest rates close to the policy rate. The BOE also
hinted its readiness to cut its policy rate further by the end of this year.
However, given the improved growth outlook, we assume that the policy rate
will remain unchanged through the forecast period.
• Euro Area. Real GDP growth slowed from 2.1 percent in the first quarter
to 1.2 percent in the second quarter, in line with our July Tealbook forecast.
The slowdown reflected payback from temporary boosts to growth in the first

quarter, including unusually warm weather that had lifted construction.
Indicators for the current quarter have been mixed. On the negative side,
consumer and business confidence have fallen noticeably, and industrial
production has been weak. On the positive side, PMIs and retail sales have
been more resilient. Overall, the data suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is
weighing on economic activity but by slightly less than we anticipated. In
addition, financial market conditions have improved more quickly than
anticipated. Therefore, we revised up our growth estimates for the second half
of 2016 a touch, to 1¼ percent. We still expect unresolved weaknesses in the
k banking sector and rising anti-EU sentiment to trigger further bouts of
o
o uncertainty and volatility, which will weigh on the recovery. Thus, in spite of
l
t
u
O lower financial stress, the forecast beyond the current year is little changed:
&
We expect GDP growth to increase to 1¾ percent in 2017, supported by
l
e
v accommodative monetary policy and slightly expansionary fiscal policy, and
e
D
to settle at about that pace over the rest of the forecast period. Given the very
n
o
c subdued inflation outlook, we now believe that the European Central Bank
E
l
t ’ (ECB) will continue to purchase assets through the end of 2017. However,
n
I
because financial stress related to Brexit has moderated, we no longer expect
the ECB to cut its deposit rate further.
• Japan. Second-quarter growth was 0.7 percent, in line with the July Tealbook
estimate and down from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. The slowdown
partly reflected the disruptions caused by the earthquake in April, and we
project that GDP growth will pick up to 1 percent in the third quarter.
However, with the manufacturing PMI remaining slightly contractionary, we
continue to expect growth to slow to ¾ percent in the fourth quarter and
remain near that pace over the next couple of years.
At its July meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) disappointed markets by easing
its policy stance only modestly. The BOJ’s September policy meeting will
coincide with the release of a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness
of its policies. With inflation running close to zero—partly owing to recent
yen appreciation—we assume that the BOJ will moderately increase asset
purchases, but we do not expect any major changes in the BOJ’s monetary
policy strategy. Even so, we continue to see inflation rising to only 1 percent
by late 2018.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• Mexico. Real GDP contracted 0.7 percent in the second quarter following an
expansion of 2 percent in the first. U.S. manufacturing production, which
shrank 1 percent in the second quarter, weighed on Mexican exports.
Furthermore, private consumption declined, and fiscal consolidation efforts
pushed down public-sector investment. We see growth returning to about
2¼ percent in the second half of this year, supported by improving U.S.
manufacturing production and rebounding household demand. Consistent
with this view, manufacturing PMIs rose in August and labor market
k
o
conditions continued to improve amid robust credit growth. Although our o
l
t
u
forecast for the second half of the year is down only a touch from the July O
&
Tealbook, the continued disappointing pace of growth, together with greater
l
e
expected fiscal consolidation through 2018 and downward revisions to U.S. v
e
D
manufacturing production, has made us more pessimistic about Mexico’s
n
o
medium-term outlook. We now see growth rising only slightly over the c
E
forecast period, reaching 2¾ percent by 2019, supported by some ’ l
t
n
improvement in external demand over the next two years, and, later in the I
period, by diminishing fiscal drag.
• Brazil. Brazil’s recession deepened in the second quarter, with economic
activity contracting 2.2 percent (somewhat less than we had expected) after a
1.7 percent contraction in the first quarter. Private consumption continued to
decline, and net exports fell. But after 10 consecutive quarters of contraction,
fixed investment finally grew, supported by improving business and consumer
confidence. We expect investment to strengthen further, in part because the
conclusion of impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff,
which confirmed her removal from office, has reduced political uncertainty.
Still, consumption will likely remain weak amid rising unemployment and
tight credit conditions. Fiscal consolidation is also expected to restrain
growth, given that the government recently succeeded in pushing a bill
through its Congress that limits spending growth at the state level to the rate
of inflation for the next two years. All told, we see the economy climbing out
of recession by the fourth quarter, with growth increasing to a modest
2¼ percent pace by the end of 2019.

Inflation, although quite elevated at nearly 9 percent on a 12-month basis, fell
substantially in recent quarters and is expected to reach 5½ percent by the end
of next year. We expect that the central bank of Brazil will start easing policy
next year.
• China. After rising to 7.1 percent in the second quarter, real GDP growth is
expected to slow to 6½ percent in the second half of the year. This forecast is
a touch weaker than in the July Tealbook, as slowing investment growth
suggests that the effects of earlier monetary and fiscal stimulus are tapering
off a bit more quickly than we had expected. Recent data also show a
k
o
o significant adjustment under way in heavy industry, likely reflecting the
l
t
u authorities’ efforts to reduce excess capacity in some sectors of the economy.
O
& Exports, however, have grown briskly in recent months after slumping earlier
l
e in the year, suggesting that the depreciation of the renminbi against the
v
e
D
currencies of China’s trading partners over the past several months may be
n
o having some effect. (As explained in the Domestic Economic Developments
c
E
l and Outlook section, in light of continued downward pressure on the
’
t
n
I renminbi, our forecast now calls for more depreciation of the Chinese
currency.) All told, we expect the Chinese economy to grow 6.7 percent in
2016, within the authorities’ target range of 6½ to 7 percent. Thereafter, we
continue to see growth slowing to 5¾ percent by 2019.
Falling food prices pushed down inflation to an estimated 1½ percent in the
third quarter from 2¼ percent in the second. We expect inflation to rebound
as food prices normalize before it settles at around 2½ percent by early
next year.
• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP growth picked up to
3¾ percent in the second quarter, a bit higher than estimated in the July
Tealbook and up from 2½ percent in the first quarter. The step-up was mainly
driven by a sharp rebound in Hong Kong, led by a resurgence in trade with
China and other emerging Asian countries, following Hong Kong’s surprising
output contraction in the first quarter. For the region as a whole, exports,
export orders, and PMIs—although significantly improved relative to last
year—suggest that growth will edge down to 3½ percent in the current
quarter. We expect growth to move up a bit further to 3¾ percent in 2017,
supported by accommodative policies and strengthening exports.

Financial Developments
Markets were relatively calm for much of the intermeeting period, and asset
prices moved within a fairly narrow range, although volatility increased somewhat in the
last few days of the period as market participants focused on central bank
communications in the United States and abroad. Market expectations for a policy rate
increase by the end of this year rose a bit since the July FOMC meeting, primarily
reflecting Federal Reserve communications that were viewed, on balance, as somewhat
less accommodative than expected. Nominal Treasury yields across the curve edged up.
Concerns over the impending compliance deadline for money market fund (MMF)
reform continued to drive additional net outflows from prime MMFs and put upward
pressure on some term money market rates.
 Based on a straight read of market quotes, the probability of an increase in the
target range of the federal funds rate by the end of the year rose to 52 percent,
from 43 percent just prior to the July FOMC meeting. The probability of an
increase at the September meeting declined to 14 percent.
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities increased, on net,
7, 13, and 17 basis points, respectively. s
t

 The broad dollar index declined about ½ percent on balance. Long-term p

sovereign yields rose about 25 basis points in Japan and 10 basis points in e

i
c
 Assets under management for prime MMFs dropped $205 billion more over n
a
n
the intermeeting period, while those for government MMFs increased F i
$211 billion. Most of the declines in assets at prime funds have occurred at
prime institutional funds, and such funds have also reduced weighted-average
maturities to historically low levels. Interest rate spreads over OIS rates rose
further for LIBOR, CDs, and financial CP at three-month horizons.
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained generally
accommodative, though outstanding C&I loans and CP both declined
somewhat in August.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
Over the intermeeting period, Federal Reserve communications pushed market
expectations for a rate increase this year a bit higher on net. However, domestic
economic data releases appeared to be a little softer, on balance, than investors had
expected. Whereas the data released early in the intermeeting period were seen as mixed,
data released toward the end of the period, particularly the August employment report
and the August ISM surveys, were below expectations. Based on a straight read of
federal funds futures, the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal
funds rate occurring at the September meeting was volatile but ended the period slightly
lower at 14 percent, while the probability of an increase by the end of the year rose to
52 percent. In the medium term, the federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of
market quotes edged up on net. The implied federal funds rates at the end of 2017 and
2018 increased 6 and 7 basis points, respectively.
s
Consistent with market-based estimates, respondents to the Desk’s September t
n
e
surveys of primary dealers and market participants assigned a probability of about m
p
o
15 percent to a rate hike at the September meeting. The median respondent in each
l
e
v
survey continues to expect only one hike in 2016, with respondents generally expecting e
D
the rate hike to occur at the December meeting. The most likely path of the target federal l
a
i
c
funds rate in 2017 and 2018 was relatively little changed for the median respondent. n

Nominal Treasury yields increased, on net, since the July FOMC meeting, with
yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury securities 7, 13, and 17 basis points higher,
respectively.1 Yields moved higher toward the end of the period amid perceptions that
global monetary policy may be less accommodative than expected going forward.
Five-to-ten-year TIPS-based inflation compensation rose 9 basis points but remained near
1 Since the July FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department auctioned $234 billion of nominal
fixed-rate Treasury securities, $14 billion of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and $28 billion of
2-year Floating Rate Notes.

the lower end of its historical range. Measures of liquidity conditions in the Treasury
market were stable over the intermeeting period.
The S&P 500 stock price index declined 1.9 percent, on net, since the July FOMC
meeting. Stock prices of sectors that benefit from lower interest rates, such as REITs and
utilities, underperformed the broader market, while those of sectors that benefit from
higher interest rates, such as banks, outperformed the broader market. Realized and
implied volatilities in various asset markets were relatively low during most of the
intermeeting period, with the VIX remaining near the lower end of its historical range,
but increased somewhat in the last few days of the period as market participants digested
global central bank communications.
Spreads on yields of nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities declined somewhat to levels fairly close to their historical
norms. Mutual funds that invest in investment-grade corporate bonds experienced
notable inflows in recent weeks.
Foreign Developments
Low volatility also prevailed in international financial markets, and global risk
assets broadly appreciated amid improving risk sentiment, although late in the period
volatility increased somewhat. Equity prices in the AFEs and EMEs generally rose. In s
t
n
the EMEs, capital inflows continued, and sovereign and corporate spreads narrowed e
m
further. Consistent with this “risk on” tone in foreign markets, the staff’s broad dollar p

Investor reaction to news from the ECB and Bank of Japan (BOJ) contributed to
the pickup in volatility at the end of the period. The ECB left rates unchanged at its
September meeting as expected but disappointed some investors by not announcing an
extension of its asset purchase program. Global yields moved higher and the euro
strengthened after the meeting, with German 10-year yields moving back into positive
territory.

At its July meeting, the BOJ announced easing measures that left investors
underwhelmed, causing the yen to appreciate and bond yields to jump. The BOJ left its
deposit rate unchanged and chose only to expand its purchases of exchange-traded stock
funds. The BOJ also established a facility to lend Japanese sovereign bonds for use as
collateral at the BOJ’s swap-related dollar funding operations to counter potential dollar
funding pressures in Japan and address possible stigma concerns. In subsequent days, the
BOJ’s asset purchases were also more concentrated than had been expected on the short
end of the maturity spectrum, prompting a further increase in longer-term yields. Over
the period, long-term Japanese yields were up about 25 basis points, while the yen
appreciated about 2½ percent against the dollar.
In contrast, at its early August meeting, the Bank of England announced a rate cut
of 25 basis points to 0.25 percent, a resumption of its asset purchase program, and a new
bank funding program. Long-term yields and the pound fell immediately following the
announcement but retraced on the back of positive economic data later in the period.
Short-Term Funding Markets and Federal Reserve Operations
MMF reform, intended to make the MMF industry more resilient, continued to
affect several short-term funding markets in advance of the October 14, 2016, compliance
deadline for a number of substantive reforms.2 While total assets under the management
of MMFs changed little over the intermeeting period, investors continued to shift from t s

prime funds to government funds.3 As a result, MMF holdings of CP and CDs continued m

anticipation of more large outflows before the compliance date, prime institutional funds
further reduced their weighted-average maturities to a historically low level of 12 days,
relative to an average of about 40 days over the past few years.
2 The reform imposes floating NAVs (net asset values) for institutional prime funds and municipal
funds and permits liquidity fees and redemption gates for all nongovernment funds.
3 The drop in assets under management for prime MMFs was steep, with $205 billion this
intermeeting period, compared with the decline of $120 billion over the previous intermeeting period.
4 The respondents indicated that funding for CDs increased from corporations, foreign banking
organizations, and other lenders.

Reflecting MMFs’ reduced appetite for term lending, spreads over OIS of longer-
term money market rates—including LIBOR, CDs, and financial CP at three-month
horizons—were higher during the intermeeting period.5 Short-term municipal rates and
tax-exempt money funds’ net yields also increased sharply, primarily because of outflows
from these funds. These increases in spreads, particularly those resulting from a rise in
LIBOR, which serves as a reference rate for trillions of dollars in adjustable-rate loans,
will likely increase the financing costs for some nonfinancial firms (for more details, see
the box “Floating-Rate Debt of Nonfinancial Corporations”).6
MMF reform also has affected the banking sector. Higher CD rates and LIBOR
may not only increase funding costs for some banks, but also boost revenues from
floating-rate loans (for additional information, see the box “Some Effects of Money
Market Reform on U.S. Banks”). Foreign banks faced increased dollar funding costs
associated with the new rules, as MMFs reduced their holdings of unsecured debt issued
by foreign banks. Japanese banks experienced the largest decreases in unsecured debt,
close to $30 billion—or 20 percent of their unsecured debt—over the past three months.
Foreign banks’ three-month CD spreads over OIS and the three-month dollar–yen FX
swap basis rose modestly, although the one-month dollar–yen FX swap basis rose more
steeply.
Reflecting the increased flows into government money funds, average daily s

MMF reform, however, has yet to materially affect overnight rates. The

6 The median respondent in the September Desk surveys predicted the three-month LIBOR–OIS
spread to be 40 basis points after the October 14 deadline, about the same as that implied by market quotes.
7 The Desk reinvested $19 billion of maturing Treasury securities, purchased $50 billion of
15- and 30-year MBS under the reinvestment program, and did not roll any expected MBS settlements over
the intermeeting period.

Floating-Rate Debt of Nonfinancial Corporations
The increase in the three-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) since mid-
June has raised concerns about a potential increase in borrowing costs for
nonfinancial corporations. The table below shows these corporations have roughly
$2 trillion of outstanding debt with rates linked to LIBOR, about one-fourth of these
firms’ $7.5 trillion in total debt outstanding. We consider how the prevalence of
interest rate floors, infrequent resetting of rates, and the hedging behavior of firms
limits the increase in interest costs for nonfinancial borrowers as a result of an
upward shift in LIBOR. We conclude by providing an estimate of the increase in
interest costs under different LIBOR scenarios.1
Although the vast majority of outstanding corporate bonds have fixed interest rates,
we estimate that 75 percent of corporate loans have floating rates that typically
reference three-month LIBOR.2 Of corporate loans benchmarked to LIBOR, about
two-thirds ($1.4 trillion) are term loans. Almost all term loans have LIBOR floors,
which stipulate the minimum level for the reference rate and thus eliminate
variability in interest payments when the reference rate is below the floor.3 The
median interest rate floor for term loans is currently 1 percent, while LIBOR is
currently about 85 basis points. Additionally, the floating rate that determines a
loan’s interest rate is customarily reset quarterly. Both factors are likely to soften the
reaction of interest expense to changes in LIBOR.
The remaining one-third of floating-rate loans are revolving lines of credit. Borrowers
incur interest costs only when they draw on the credit facility.4 Although lines of

1 This analysis draws on regulatory loan-level data in the Y-14 for a large subset (about
80 percent of the universe) of floating-rate corporate loans. The breakdown of interest rate floor
and rate reset timing characteristics from this sample of loans is extrapolated to the universe of
nonfinancial corporate loans in the Z1 Financial Accounts. See “Some Effects of Money Market
Reform on U.S. Banks” for a discussion of how these loans affect bank profitability.
2 For more details on the effect of increases in interest rates on corporate bonds, see Richard
Ogden, Francisco Palomino, Nitish Sinha, and Youngsuk Yook (2016), “Corporate Bond Issuers’
Swap Exposure to Rising Interest Rates,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, May 26), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-
notes/2016/corporate-bond-issuers-swap-exposure-to-rising-interest-rates-20160526.html.
3 Recall that the interest rate on floating-rate loans includes both LIBOR and a constant spread;
the floor described here applies only to the LIBOR component.
4 In aggregate, nonfinancial corporate borrowers have only used $564 billion of $2 trillion
committed as revolving lines of credit.

credit do not typically have interest rate floors, they do typically reset the level of
their reference rate quarterly, similar to term loans. This factor tends to weaken the
reaction of interest expense to changes in LIBOR.
The figure below shows estimates of the additional interest expense from loans for
nonfinancial borrowers given different increases in LIBOR, taking into account the
effect of interest rate floors. We consider four scenarios, including the current
20 basis point increase since mid-June (Scenario 1 in the figure) as well as three larger
increases in three-month LIBOR, up to 80 basis points (Scenario 4). This exercise
assumes that the increase in LIBOR persists for one year and that loan reference
rates reset instantaneously. As such, this estimate provides an upper bound of
additional interest expense for nonfinancial borrowers.
We estimate the increase of LIBOR in Scenario 1 (+20 basis points) causes 62 percent
of outstanding loans to adjust to the prevailing value of three-month LIBOR.5
Further, almost all loans will adjust their LIBOR component to the prevailing rate if
LIBOR was to move above 100 basis points (Scenario 2). Nonetheless, the additional
interest expense of even an 80 basis point increase in LIBOR relative to its value in
mid-June (Scenario 4) would equal about $12 billion, which is less than 1 percent of
earnings of nonfinancial corporations (shown by the black line). Quarterly resetting
of interest rates further damps these estimates of the interest expense.
Finally, these calculations do not take into account some firms’ use of derivatives to
hedge interest rate risk, which could further limit the effect of higher interest rates
on their net interest expenses.6 However, in recent years corporations do not
appear to be actively engaged in interest rate hedging. In fiscal year 2015, we
estimate only around 15 percent of nonfinancial corporations were actively hedging
interest rate risk.7 s

5 This percentage is the combined total for both categories of loans discussed in the table:

6 The increase in net interest expense may also be offset by returns from investments the
company has made in short-term instruments, which we have not taken into account.
7 This estimate is based on a textual analysis of 10-K filings to the SEC by nonfinancial
corporations with outstanding bank debt.

Some Effects of Money Market Reform on U.S. Banks
This discussion examines three ways in which U.S. banks might be affected by money market
fund (MMF) reform: the ability to raise funds through negotiable certificates of deposit
(CDs); the reallocation of funds by investors from money funds into bank deposits; and
upward repricing of bank loans, given increases in short-term rates, such as LIBOR (London
interbank offered rate).
As the money fund industry’s demand for very short-term investments has increased and its
demand for longer-term private securities has decreased, 60- and 90-day CD yields have risen
relative to OIS (overnight index swap) rates, suggesting that some banks are paying more to
obtain funding at those terms. Even with the higher yields, outflows of large time deposits
have occurred in July and August, largely at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
(figure 1). These branches and agencies, which depend on large time deposits for about
30 percent of their funding, have responded since June by raising funds through borrowed
money, such as fed funds and repo. In contrast to the experience of foreign banks, large time
deposits have been mostly stable at domestic banks, which raise about 7 percent of their
funds through such deposits. However, data on the eight LISCC (Large Institution
Supervision Coordinating Committee) banks show a noticeable decline since mid-August in
outstanding negotiable CDs—that is, wholesale CDs held by institutional investors such as
MMFs and that account for about 1 percent of LISCC banks’ liabilities. Nevertheless, the
LISCC banks have not significantly altered the maturity composition of their negotiable CDs,
as the weighted-average maturity of these CDs has fluctuated in a range from 100 to 120 days
in recent months (even as the weighted-average maturity of prime MMF holdings has
decreased substantially).
s
t U.S. banks appear to be receiving stepped-up inflows of other types of deposits. Figure 1
n
e
m shows that banks received a net inflow of about $115 billion in core deposits in August, the
p highest monthly increase at banks in the past five years. Some of these inflows may be

while deposits from “nonsupervised financial entities”—including mutual funds—have been
roughly flat in the past two months. Overall, the deposit inflows have been relatively small
compared with the decline of several hundred billion dollars in assets under management at
prime money funds over the past year. In addition, whether these deposits will stay in the
banking system is unclear. Investors will likely take some time to reach a new equilibrium
allocation of their liquid assets.
Some bank loan rates may reprice higher in response to the 20 basis point increase in the
three-month LIBOR since June, as many loan rates are set as spreads over LIBOR. The table
below shows that LIBOR is used as a reference rate for about 60 percent of large banks’
business loans, which we focus on because they tend to reset more frequently than
household loans. Rising loan rates could buoy bank profitability given sticky deposit pricing
but would also represent a tightening of financial conditions for borrowers. The extent to
which bank loan rates move up depends on the specific reference rate, the duration of the
rise in rates, how frequently the loan rates reprice, and the extent to which interest rate
floors are binding. Such calculations and the potential effect on nonfinancial corporations
are explored further in the Financial Developments box “Floating Rate Debt of Nonfinancial
Corporations.”
In summary, as the cost of term funding via CDs has increased, declines in CD funding in the
U.S. banking system to date have been largely confined to branches and agencies of foreign
banks. Domestic banks have received stepped-up inflows of other deposits. Many banks are
positioned to benefit from increased revenue from existing loans on their balance sheets
should the recent rise in LIBOR persist. Looking forward, further reallocation of investments
out of prime funds is expected to occur as additional fund conversions are pending. Whether
such outflows will continue to have relatively small effects on U.S. banks will depend on the
s
magnitude and the timing of those withdrawals and also on the extent to which investors n t
e
decide to abruptly pull out of prime money funds instead of more smoothly reallocating their m
p
investments over time or even staying put.1 o

FINANCING CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESSES, MUNICIPALITIES,
AND HOUSEHOLDS
Business and Municipal Finance
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained generally accommodative.
While aggregate C&I loan balances and CP outstanding at nonfinancial firms both
declined somewhat, gross issuance of corporate bonds was quite brisk in August, bucking
the seasonal trend of slow issuance in the summer months. Corporations issued equity
through seasoned offerings at a somewhat faster pace than that observed over the past
few years. In contrast, equity issuance through initial public offerings remained subdued,
and share repurchase volumes slowed.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations, which had deteriorated a bit over
the past few quarters, showed signs of stabilization in the current intermeeting period.
The volume of corporate bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of downgrades in August.
Further, both the six-month trailing bond default rate and the KMV expected year-ahead
default measure edged down, although they remained elevated compared with their
ranges in recent years. Projections by Wall Street analysts for year-ahead earnings for

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage and consumer credit markets
were broadly unchanged over the intermeeting period and remained accommodative on
balance. The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages moved higher, in line with
comparable-maturity Treasury yields, but remained at a low level of about 3.4 percent.
Refinancing activity in August was the highest in three years, reflecting low mortgage
rates during June and July. Interest rates on consumer loans, such as variable-rate credit
cards and new auto loans, were also little changed. Consumer loan balances stood
6.5 percent higher in July than a year earlier. Auto and student loan originations
remained solid, though the rate of growth of student loans trended down further. Credit
card balances continued to expand at a robust pace.
Household delinquency rates were generally little changed across loan categories.
Mortgage delinquency rates continued to decline, reflecting in part the relatively tight
mortgage underwriting conditions for less creditworthy borrowers over the past several
years, continued solid house price gains, and improved economic fundamentals. Credit
card delinquency rates remained near historically low levels, while student loan
delinquency rates were little changed at elevated levels. Auto loan delinquency rates,
however, continued to edge up, partly as a result of the broad availability of auto loans to
subprime borrowers.

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, importantly because both monetary and fiscal
policy appear to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial
adverse ones. Foreign developments and prospects also pose some downside risk to the
U.S. economy. Although near-term concerns associated with Brexit have diminished,
downside risks to the global economy remain. Notably, the transition to slower growth in
the Chinese economy could turn into a severe slowdown. Moreover, in the event of
adverse developments, foreign authorities would likely face similar constraints in
providing policy stimulus as in the United States. We view the risks around our
unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to
the upside.
With regard to inflation, we see considerable uncertainty around our projection,
but we do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. At the same time,
we continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted somewhat to the
downside. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain very low, as do
some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations. In addition, the
realization of the downside risks to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the
foreign exchange value of the dollar, thereby depressing U.S. import prices and inflation.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct six alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario explores the
consequences of continued restraint in business investment. In the second scenario, long-
term rates fail to increase despite the rising policy rate featured in the baseline—a repeat y

final scenario considers the possibility that stronger growth abroad may cause the dollar
to depreciate relative to the baseline.
The first and second scenarios are simulated in the FRB/US model. The third
scenario uses the EDO model, and the fourth scenario uses the Smets-Wouters model.
The fifth and sixth scenarios are run in the multicountry SIGMA model. In all the
scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the same inertial policy rule as in the
baseline, including the adjustments to the intercept in the near term. In all cases, we
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow the baseline paths.
Weak Business Investment
Business investment has recently surprised us on the downside. The BEA
estimates that, over the past three quarters, fixed nonresidential investment (including
both equipment and intangibles as well as structures) and inventory investment have
taken about 1 percentage point, on average, off of GDP growth at an annual rate. In the
staff forecast, the downturn in business investment spending is short lived, with positive
growth contributions from fixed and inventory investment resuming in the second half of
this year. However, this reversal may fail to materialize, and, in this scenario, we assume
that whatever factors have led to the weak pace of business investment experienced in
recent quarters prove more persistent than in the baseline. Specifically, the scenario
assumes that fixed business investment declines at an average annual rate of 1 percent
over the next four quarters before starting to increase again, while inventories continue to
run off through the end of this year.
Real GDP rises at an almost 2 percent annual rate in 2017, ½ percentage point
less than in the baseline. The unemployment rate moves down more gradually than in the
baseline and is just above 4½ percent by the end of 2019. Given the low responsiveness
of inflation to aggregate demand in the FRB/US model, inflation is little changed. With
less resource utilization, the federal funds rate rises more gradually than in the baseline
projection.

conventional workings of monetary policy. In particular, long-term interest rates may fail
to rise in response to monetary policy tightening, a situation similar to the Greenspan
conundrum of the mid-2000s.1
This scenario simulates the macroeconomic consequences of such a disconnect
between the policy rate and long-term rates. Consistent with the original Greenspan
conundrum period, we keep long rates fixed over the next six quarters at their levels as of
the third quarter of this year; the short rate evolves according to the inputs of the Taylor
rule. Starting in the first quarter of 2018, the conundrum slowly unwinds, and the link
between short and long rates is fully restored by the end of the simulation period.
In this scenario, lower long-term rates boost asset prices and spur consumption
and investment spending. As a result, real GDP growth reaches 3 percent in 2018, about
1 percentage point above the baseline. With a buoyant economy, the trajectory for the
unemployment rate is lower than in the staff forecast, reaching 3¼ percent in 2019,
whereas inflation moves up only marginally above the baseline to 2 percent.2 By the end
of 2019, consistent with output well above potential, the federal funds rate has increased
steeply to 4¼ percent, 1 percentage point higher than in the Tealbook projection. As the
conundrum unwinds and long rates start to rise along with the short rate, GDP growth
declines and the unemployment rate returns to the baseline, although inflation still
remains a little higher.
Temporarily Weaker Productivity
Labor productivity growth has been weak over the past several years, averaging
less than ½ percent per year from 2011 through 2015 and posting a decline over the most
recent four quarters. In the baseline projection, productivity growth is assumed to pick
up to an average annual rate of 1.1 percent between 2017 and 2019, similar to the average
pace over the past 10 years. However, the recent subdued growth of productivity may
persist longer than we envision in the baseline. In this scenario, labor productivity
growth is assumed to remain at only ½ percent per year over the next two years before
gradually moving up to the baseline pace.3 The weaker path of labor productivity is

driven by a combination of lower total factor productivity (TFP) growth and positive
shocks to aggregate demand.4
Although real GDP rises more slowly than in the baseline, the unemployment rate
follows a lower trajectory, declining to 4 percent by the end of 2018, consistent with the
weaker labor productivity and positive shocks to aggregate demand. These forces drive
up firms’ marginal costs of production, leading to a higher path for inflation, which
reaches 2¼ percent by the end of 2018, ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.
As a result of both the tighter resource utilization and higher inflation, the federal funds
rate rises faster than in the baseline and reaches 4¼ percent at the end of 2020.
Permanently Stronger Productivity
Some recent research suggests that productivity growth over the past few years
may have been depressed by a slowdown in start-up activity and a weakening of firms’
efforts to fully exploit positive productivity shocks—both possibly a result of difficulties
accessing financing.5 With financing conditions for firms much improved from the
immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, these restraints may no longer bind and
productivity growth may rise faster than has been typical in recent years. This scenario
illustrates the implications of such stronger productivity growth by assuming that
structural productivity permanently grows ½ percentage point faster than in the baseline.
The higher path for productivity encourages households and firms to spend more,
which causes output growth to pick up to 2¾ percent at the end of 2017. However,
because this more rapid growth is matched by a pickup in potential output, the
unemployment rate is little changed from the baseline for the entire simulation period.
Inflation is ½ percentage point lower in 2017 and 2018, as the productivity shock reduces
firms’ marginal costs of production and, hence, price pressure.6 In the model used for
this simulation, a permanent increase in TFP growth of ½ percentage point raises the
long-run real federal funds rate by just under ¾ percentage point. In this scenario, the
deviation in the level of productivity in the simulation from the baseline after two years is roughly at the
lower 15th percentile of outcomes.

increase in the long-run real funds rate is recognized immediately by monetary
policymakers, who adjust their estimates of r* accordingly. This increase in r* almost
exactly offsets the effects of lower inflation on the Taylor rule prescription for the federal
funds rate. Consequently, the federal funds rate path remains similar to the Tealbook
forecast.
Stronger Dollar
The staff baseline projects that the broad real dollar will appreciate 1½ percent per
year over the forecast period as the federal funds rate rises faster than markets currently
appear to expect. However, ongoing U.S. policy normalization could cause a much
larger and more persistent appreciation of the dollar, especially if higher U.S. interest
rates generate financial turbulence in vulnerable EMEs. In this scenario, we assume that,
relative to the baseline, the broad real dollar appreciates 10 percent by the end of next
year, the term premium on U.S. long-term bonds increases slightly, and EME corporate
borrowing spreads rise substantially in the face of capital outflows from EMEs.7 All told,
foreign GDP growth runs about ¾ percentage point below the baseline in 2017,
notwithstanding the sizable depreciation of foreign currencies.
The stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth depress U.S. real net exports.
Consequently, U.S. real GDP growth is 1¾ percent in 2017, almost ¾ percentage point
less than in the baseline. Lower import prices and weaker economic activity cause core
PCE inflation to be only 1 percent in 2017. The federal funds rate follows a shallower
path than in the baseline, rising to about 2¼ percent by the end of 2019.
Faster Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar
In our baseline forecast, we see the headwinds facing the foreign economies as
diminishing only gradually as foreign output expands at a modest pace and inflation
slowly edges closer to central bank targets. However, the recovery abroad might be
faster if highly accommodative foreign monetary policies, abating fiscal pressures, and
ongoing improvements in financial conditions—including in the EMEs—generate a
bigger impetus to household and business spending than assumed in the baseline. In this

7 In this scenario, the term premium on longer-term U.S. Treasury securities is assumed to rise c
n
slightly, as might occur if investors were disappointed that monetary policy was not more accommodative U
than implied by the inertial Taylor rule. However, if flight-to-safety flows into dollar-denominated assets
&
were sufficiently large, the term premium could well decline.

scenario, we assume that foreign GDP growth rises to above 3 percent over the next two
years and thus averages about ½ percentage point per year higher than under our baseline
projection. Increased optimism about the durability of the foreign recovery—and the
perception of diminished tail risks—causes the broad real dollar to depreciate 8 percent
by the end of next year, reversing about half of the appreciation that has occurred since
the middle of 2014.
U.S. real GDP expands 2¾ percent in 2017, nearly ½ percentage point more than
in the baseline, as the weaker dollar and stronger foreign growth boost U.S. real net
exports. The unemployment rate falls to 3¾ percent by the end of 2019. Higher import
prices and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to move persistently
above 2 percent by early 2018. The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the
baseline, reaching almost 4 percent by the end of 2019.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that y

forecast errors were positive more than half of the time. a i

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
