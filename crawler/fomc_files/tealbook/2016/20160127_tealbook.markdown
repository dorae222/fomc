Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
We have made only modest changes to our baseline domestic economic outlook D
n
relative to our December forecast. To be sure, the available indicators of both spending o
c
E
and production that have become available during the intermeeting period have been
c
i
t
weaker than we had expected, even after looking through some factors that we think will s
e
m
unwind in the next few months.1 Moreover, financial conditions have tightened notably, o
D
with equity prices down about 10 percent since the previous Tealbook, the dollar about
3 percent stronger, and risk spreads in debt markets wider. That said, the labor report for
December was stronger than we expected, and initial claims for unemployment insurance
have drifted up only slightly from very low levels late last year.
Overall, balancing the labor market data against the other indicators, we assess the
cyclical position of the economy as only slightly weaker than we thought it would be at
the time of the December Tealbook. In our baseline projection, we continue to forecast
that real activity will move a little above its sustainable level during the next few years:
At the end of 2018, we now have real GDP 1¼ percent above potential and the
unemployment rate finishing that year at 4.6 percent, ½ percentage point below our
estimate of its natural rate. Both of these measures are a shade less strong than in the
previous projection.
At the same time, we also see the downside risks to our forecast of real activity as
more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about
global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence at home and abroad.
Our projection for total PCE inflation is lower over the first half of this year,
mainly as a result of the higher dollar and the lower path for oil prices. However, we
continue to project that total PCE inflation will move up to 2 percent in 2018, as energy
prices bottom out and start to increase moderately, import prices turn back up, and
resource utilization tightens further in an environment of stable long-term inflation
expectations.
1 These transitory factors include a significant slowdown in inventory investment in the fourth
quarter of 2015, unusually warm weather that suppressed household outlays for energy services, and a
change in mortgage regulations that temporarily depressed home sales. These factors are all assumed to
abate or reverse in the first half of 2016.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
e
v
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2015 is below the Blue Chip
D
consensus forecast and the median projection from the Survey of Professional
n
o Forecasters (SPF) (although the latter dates from mid‐November). The staff’s GDP
c
E forecast is close to the others in 2016 but ½ percentage point below the Blue Chip
c
i forecast for 2017. The staff’s forecast for unemployment is close to the others
t
s
e throughout the medium term. Its inflation projections are generally lower,
m
o particularly in 2016.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS u t
O
&
Monetary Policy
l
e
v
 As in previous projections, the path for the federal funds rate is governed by e
D
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule. In this round, the federal n
o
c
funds rate generated by the rule averages about 3¼ percent in the fourth E
c
i
quarter of 2018, about ¼ percentage point lower than in the December s t
e
m
Tealbook, mostly reflecting the downward revision to the projection for the
o
D
output gap.
 We now assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current size until
the fourth quarter of this year, at which point the portfolio will begin to
contract as proceeds from maturing assets are not reinvested. Compared with
the December Tealbook, the cessation of reinvestment was delayed two
quarters, which we view as more consistent with the FOMC’s statement that
reinvestment would continue until normalization was “well under way.”
Other Interest Rates
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise
significantly, reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well as an
increase in the term premium from its current near-zero value toward its
assumed longer-term level of ¾ percentage point. Compared with the
December Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield is slightly lower in the
medium term, reflecting both the lower path of short-term rates and the later
assumed date for the cessation of reinvestment of the SOMA portfolio.2
 We revised the paths for the 30-year mortgage rate and the 10-year triple-B
corporate bond rate mostly in line with the revision to Treasury yields.
Spreads of rates on triple-B corporate bonds over those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities have been rising gradually for the past year, and
we project them to remain elevated for several quarters into the projection
period.
2 The downward revision to the federal funds rate does not persist much past the medium term and
thus has only a modest effect on the 10-year Treasury yield.

l
u t Equity Prices and Home Prices
O
&  As of the market close on January 19, stock prices had fallen about 10 percent
l
e since the time of the December Tealbook, leading us to revise down our
v
e
D
projection for stock prices throughout the medium term. We judge that a
n
o portion of the recent drop in equity prices reflects a transitory increase in
c
E
c investor risk aversion and thus assume that only a little more than half of the
i
t
s
e decline persists by the end of 2018. We project that, after stock prices drop
m
o substantially in the current quarter, they will appreciate about 3½ percent per
D
year over the medium term, a shade faster than in the previous Tealbook.
 We continue to expect house prices to decelerate further, from an increase of
5 percent last year to an average gain of around 2¾ percent per year over the
medium term. One simple model of housing valuation that we monitor
suggests that housing is currently overvalued by 7 percent, compared with
more than 40 percent a decade ago; a second model suggests housing is about
fairly valued.3
Fiscal Policy
 We now anticipate that fiscal policy will be a bit more expansionary than we
had previously assumed, reflecting provisions of the omnibus spending bill
that was enacted in mid-December. The bill contained two tax law changes
that we had not anticipated: a multiyear extension of the bonus depreciation
tax credit for business investment and a delay in introducing several taxes
related to the Affordable Care Act. Overall, we now expect fiscal policy
actions at all levels of government to provide a ½ percentage point boost to
GDP growth this year and a more modest boost to growth in 2017 and 2018.4
3 Both models were described in a pair of recent memos sent to the Committee on January 16,
2016: “Staff Assessment of Housing Overvaluation,” by Steven Laufer, and “Measuring Housing
Overvaluation Using the Zillow Price-to-Rent Ratio,” by Raven Molloy. The first model assesses the
price-to-rent ratio against costs of housing investment (such as interest rates) and a linear trend that may
reflect challenges associated with measuring house prices and rents. The second model takes a similar
approach but relies on different data sources to construct price-to-rent ratios.
4 Specifically, we project fiscal impetus to be 0.6 percentage point in 2016 (up from
0.4 percentage point in the December Tealbook), 0.3 percentage point in 2017, and 0.1 percentage point in
2018. The estimates for 2017 and 2018 are little revised.

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar u t
O
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated 3 percent, on net, since the time of &
l
e
the December Tealbook. In the wake of the recent volatility in Chinese v
e
D
exchange rates and financial markets, the dollar strengthened against almost
n
all currencies except the Japanese yen. We expect the nominal dollar to rise a o
c
E
touch further in the first half of this year—lifted by widening monetary policy c
i
t
s
divergences between the United States and advanced foreign economies and e
m
some further depreciation of the Chinese renminbi and other emerging Asian o
D
currencies—and then to be little changed over the medium term. By the end
of 2018, our projection for the broad real dollar is about 4 percent higher than
in the previous Tealbook.
 We estimate that foreign real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the
fourth quarter, slower than the 2½ percent pace of the third quarter but still up
from a very subdued 1½ percent pace in the first half of 2015. Our estimate
for the fourth quarter has been revised down ¼ percentage point relative to the
December Tealbook, largely on account of weaker-than-expected data for
Canada. Although we are attuned to the heightened risks emanating from
China and global commodity markets, we continue to see growth abroad
rising to about 3 percent by the end of 2016, albeit with a somewhat weaker
start to the year that mainly reflects the expected near-term effect of lower oil
prices on activity in Canada and other commodity exporters. We project
foreign economic growth to remain near 3 percent through 2018, supported by
accommodative monetary policies and depreciated currencies.
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices
 Oil prices have tumbled since the December Tealbook, with the spot price of
Brent oil down another $12 per barrel, closing at $29 per barrel on
January 19. Further-dated futures have moved down even more sharply, with
the December 2018 futures quote falling $14, to $43 per barrel. Both demand
and supply factors have weighed on oil prices. On the demand side, worries
include the outlook for economic growth in China and its implications for the
global economy. On the supply side, U.S. oil production remains near its
recent peak, resulting in high and growing oil inventories; in addition, the
lifting of export sanctions against Iran has firmed expectations of increased
Iranian oil exports. Our forecast for the price of imported oil in the current

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
The incoming data on spending and production in the fourth quarter were
substantially weaker than we had expected, leading us to mark down our estimate of real
GDP growth last quarter to a paltry ½ percent at an annual rate—1¼ percentage points
less than in the December Tealbook and a marked deceleration from the 2 percent
increase in the third quarter.5 While downward revisions were widespread across
spending categories, the largest contributions to the revision were from inventory
investment and consumer spending. We expect a bounceback in some spending
categories from what we judge to be transitory softness, but we also took some signal for
the underlying pace of activity from weaker readings in other categories. In all, we
project real GDP will increase at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the current quarter,
unrevised from the December Tealbook.
 The recent data suggest that consumer spending slowed by considerably more
last quarter than we had projected, apparently advancing at an annual rate of
just 1¾ percent. Part of the weakness reflected unusually warm weather,
which we think held down spending for energy services in both November
and December. However, the first official estimate of December retail sales
was surprisingly low, motor vehicle sales fell more than we had anticipated
(though to a still-strong level), and spending on services outside energy was a
bit softer in November than we expected, suggesting that other factors were
also at work. For the current quarter, we project PCE growth to step up to a
3 percent pace. Spending this quarter is boosted, in part, by a rebound in
5 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q4 Real GDP Growth,” the
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at
1.5 percent, is 1 percentage point higher than the staff’s judgmental projection. For reference, the standard
error from the Board staff’s dynamic factor model is nearly 1½ percentage points.

 Incoming data on housing activity remain consistent with a sector that
continues to recover gradually from its very subdued levels of recent years.
Here, too, a transitory factor—related to recently implemented mortgage-
lending reporting rules—held down residential investment growth last
quarter.6
 Business fixed investment appears to have risen moderately in the fourth
quarter but is likely to decelerate sharply in the current quarter. Business
purchases of motor vehicles are anticipated to fall after a couple of strong
quarters. Moreover, we now expect spending on other equipment to rise only
modestly in the near term, given data on orders and shipments through
November that were somewhat disappointing as well as negative readings
from some of the business surveys. In addition, we expect drilling and mining
investment to continue falling sharply this quarter (nearly 40 percent at an
annual rate), reflecting the further decreases in energy prices. In all, business
fixed investment is projected to be about flat in the first quarter after
increasing at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent over the second half of 2015.
 After subtracting an estimated ¾ percentage point from real GDP growth in
the third quarter, inventory investment appears to have deducted nearly
1 percentage point from real GDP growth last quarter, a drag more than
½ percentage point larger than we had projected in December. With limited
6 Residential investment in the fourth quarter, as measured in the NIPA, will be held down by a
sharp fall in the sales of existing homes in November. The drop reportedly reflects delays in mortgage
closings related to new reporting rules for mortgage lenders implemented by the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau in October as part of the Truth-in-Lending Act/RESPA disclosures. We expect these
delays will be relatively short-lived—indeed, we expect a solid rebound in sales in the coming months—
but the effect of sales closings on brokers’ commissions, all else being equal, lowers residential investment
in the fourth quarter and raises it in the current quarter.

 We estimate that net exports subtracted almost ½ percentage point from real E

o
D
GDP growth by 1 percentage point, as past dollar appreciation pushes exports
down further and boosts import growth.
 Industrial production declined in December for the third consecutive month.
The sizable downdraft in oil and gas drilling continues to subtract from
mining activity, and utilities output fell sharply as a result of the unusually
warm temperatures in recent months. Manufacturing output only edged up at
an annual rate of ½ percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting a pullback in
motor vehicle assemblies from the elevated levels seen earlier in the year,
weakness in exports, and adverse upstream effects of the reduction in oil
drilling. With these same forces continuing to weigh on the sector,
manufacturing IP is expected to increase just ½ percent in the current quarter,
a tepid outlook that is consistent with the low readings of the national and
regional manufacturing surveys.
Beyond the near term, real GDP growth is expected to run above our estimate of
its potential, supported by the still-accommodative stance of monetary policy and by
expansionary fiscal policy.
 After rising 1¾ percent in 2015, real GDP is projected to increase 2½ percent
this year, with the pickup reflecting a solid gain in PCE and a boost from
federal purchases. Consumption growth in 2016 is projected to be bolstered
by ongoing gains in real disposable personal income that reflect further
improvements in the labor market. In addition, the effects of earlier increases
in the wealth-to-income ratio are anticipated to support spending growth
slightly this year.
 Real GDP growth then slows over the rest of the projection period, to
2 percent in 2017 and to 1¾ percent in 2018, as consumer and business

these factors are partly offset by the positive impetus from more expansionary

GDP growth in the final quarter of last year and growth rates that are revised
down slightly thereafter, the projected level of real GDP at the end of 2018 is
almost ½ percent lower than in our previous forecast.
 The adjustments that we made to the baseline forecast in response to the
recent movements in financial and commodity prices, which were triggered in
part by developments in China, only reflect conventional channels such as the
wealth effect operating on consumption spending, higher borrowing costs for
businesses, and the dollar appreciation acting to restrain net exports. We
assumed no additional contribution in the baseline from effects operating
through confidence or financial market disruptions, based on the following
considerations: We see the direct financial linkages between China and the
United States as modest, we assume in the baseline that financial conditions in
China and most other emerging markets will not worsen materially further,
and we view the U.S. financial system as being relatively well positioned to
absorb commodity-related shocks. (For additional detail on how we assessed
the implications of developments in China for the staff baseline forecast, see
the box “Recent Developments in China and Implications for the Outlook” in
the International Economic Developments and Outlook section.)
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
In contrast to the incoming data on spending and production, the December
employment report was stronger than we had projected.
 Nonfarm payroll employment is now estimated to have risen nearly 285,000
per month last quarter, about 45,000 more than we expected and 110,000

faster than the third-quarter pace. In response to this faster pace of u t
O
employment gains, we boosted our expectation for first-quarter hiring by
&
25,000, to 240,000 per month.7 e l
v
e
D
 The unemployment rate held steady at 5.0 percent in December, whereas we n
o
c
had expected it to tick down to 4.9 percent. However, the labor force E
c
participation rate moved back up to 62.6 percent, and the employment-to- t i
s
e
population ratio edged up and was a touch stronger than we had projected. m
o
D
We expect the unemployment rate to decline to 4.9 percent in January and to
remain there through March.
 With its latest increase, the labor force participation rate now appears to have
reversed much of the puzzling drop that occurred last summer. In response,
we raised our projection for the current quarter slightly, putting the
participation rate just 0.1 percentage point below our estimate of its trend.
(See the box “The Scope for Cyclical Recovery in Labor Force Participation”
for more information.)
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, or LMCI, an alternative, strictly
mechanical method of filtering the data, rose moderately in December.
 In light of the still-strong tenor of the data coming out of the labor market, we
think the very weak reading on GDP growth in the fourth quarter overstates
the deterioration in the cyclical position of the economy. Accordingly, we
lowered our estimates of structural productivity growth and potential output
growth in 2015 by 0.2 percentage point, to 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent,
respectively. After this adjustment, the GDP gap in the current quarter is just
a touch weaker than in our previous projection.
Reflecting the deceleration projected for real GDP, the pace of recovery in the
labor market slows over the medium term. In addition, given the slight downward
revision in projected GDP growth from here forward, we now have the labor market
improving by a little less than in the December Tealbook.
7 We think the warm weather in December may have provided a small boost to the reported
employment gains, most likely in construction.

The Scope for Cyclical Recovery in Labor Force Participation
&
l
e
e
v
Most key measures of labor market conditions—including the unemployment rate and
D
payroll employment—have improved markedly since the end of the Great Recession. In
n
o contrast, the labor force participation rate at the end of last year was 2 percentage points
c
E below its level at the end of 2009 (figure 1). We estimate that structural factors—including
c
i demographically driven trends and other secular changes in the labor market—have been
t
s
e pushing the participation rate down during the past six years, even as cyclical forces have
m
o been pushing it up; on net, the structural factors have predominated. In particular, informed
D
by a cohort‐based model of labor force participation developed by the staff, we currently
estimate that structural factors have pushed down the trend participation rate by about
2½ percentage points since 2009.1 Thus, we estimate that there has been a cyclical
improvement in the participation rate gap—the difference between the actual participation
rate and its trend—of about ½ percentage point since 2009.
In the staff’s assessment, the participation rate was still ¼ percentage point below its trend
at the end of last year, even as the unemployment rate had moved below our estimate of its
natural rate (figure 2). This estimate of the cyclical shortfall in labor force participation is in
line with our cohort‐based model and is also consistent with the still‐elevated number of
individuals who are out of the labor force but report they want a job.

The staff anticipates that there is some further scope for cyclical improvement in labor force &
l
participation, and we expect that the participation rate gap will improve almost e
v
½ percentage point during the next three years. The somewhat delayed recovery in the D
e
participation rate is in line with evidence indicating that the cyclical recovery in labor force n
o
participation is typically a late‐cycle phenomenon.2 As shown in figure 2, during the previous c
E
two recoveries the negative participation rate gap persisted well into the recovery. Indeed, c
i
the turning point for the cyclical rebound in labor force participation during the past two s
t
e
recoveries seems to have roughly coincided with the period when the unemployment rate m
o
approached its natural rate. At its cyclical peak, the participation rate seems to have been D
about ½ percentage point above its estimated trend.
Several factors can contribute to a delayed cyclical recovery in labor force participation.
First, labor supply decisions tend to be persistent. For instance, decisions to attend school
or care for children may entail multiyear commitments, and thus it may take time before
individuals react to improved labor market conditions. Second, wage growth typically
strengthens as the labor market recovery progresses, and these higher wages might
persuade individuals on the sidelines of the job market to join the labor force. In fact,
subdued wage growth in recent years may be one reason why the cyclical rebound in
participation has not been stronger so far. Third, employers’ hiring behavior is likely to
change as labor market slack diminishes, leading to increased recruiting efforts and lower
screening standards. Changes in hiring patterns and attitudes can help pull in individuals
who have low qualifications, lack recent work experience, or possess criminal records.
The staff’s assessment of the cyclical shortfall in participation is subject to considerable
uncertainty, especially in real time. On the one hand, the severity of the Great Recession and
the sluggishness of the subsequent recovery may have resulted in more permanent labor
market damage than we currently estimate, and thus the trend in participation could be
lower than currently assumed by the staff. On the other hand, the protracted labor market
weakness since the end of the Great Recession might have also led to unusually large
temporary exits from the labor force, implying that the delayed cyclical rebound in the
participation rate might be longer and larger than in previous cyclical episodes. All told,
while it is difficult to precisely quantify the relevant amount of uncertainty—which is, to a
large extent, related to model specification uncertainty—different models consulted by the
staff yield a range of participation gap estimates at the end of last year from near zero (the
FRB/US model) to negative ¾ percentage point (a variant of the cohort‐based model). A
comprehensive measure of uncertainty would surely be wider.
2 Regression results based on state‐level data suggest that the full response of the participation rate to
changes in labor market conditions materializes only after a period as long as a few years. See Aaronson
and others, “Labor Force Participation,” in note 1; Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2014), “Labor
Force Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” Journal of Money, Credit and

 All told, projected monthly job gains are little changed this year and are

 With output increasing faster than its potential rate over the medium term, the
unemployment rate moves down further, reaching 4.6 percent by 2018,
½ percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate. The cumulative
reduction in the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point less than in the
December projection.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Since the December Tealbook, we have received the CPI for November and
December and PCE prices through November.8 We now estimate total PCE prices to
have been about flat last quarter, and we expect them to decline nearly 1 percent at an
annual rate this quarter; the low level of both figures primarily reflects the pass-through
to consumer energy prices of the continued declines in oil prices. We estimate that core
PCE prices rose 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, and we project a similar rate of increase
this quarter.
 The projection for headline PCE price inflation in the current quarter is
1 percentage point lower than in the December Tealbook, largely reflecting
the lower oil price path. In addition, we have revised down our projection for
core PCE price inflation in the first quarter in response to lower import prices
as well as our translation of the December CPI and PPI data.
8 The November CPI was published on December 15, after the December projection closed but in
time for the December FOMC meeting.

Some of the recent weakness in inflation performance carries forward into the u t
O
next few quarters, but otherwise our inflation projection is about unrevised from the
&
December Tealbook. e l
v
e
D
 The higher projected path for the dollar and lower commodity prices led us to n
o
c
revise down our forecast for core import prices in 2016 relative to the E
c
December Tealbook. We now expect core import prices to decline at an t i
s
e
annual rate of 3 percent in the first half of 2016, 1¼ percentage points more m
o
D
negative than in the previous Tealbook. We expect core import prices to edge
up at a ¼ percent pace over the second half, as the effects of the higher dollar
fade and commodity prices stabilize, and then rise at around a 1 percent pace
over the remainder of the forecast period, little changed from the December
projection.
 Core PCE price inflation is projected to average 1.3 percent this year, the
same as last year. The greater tightness in resource utilization this year
relative to last contributes 0.1 percentage point to the pickup in core inflation,
but energy price pass-through into core is anticipated to have a roughly
offsetting effect. Starting next year, the transitory restraint from import and
energy prices is expected to begin subsiding, and the tightening of resource
utilization puts a bit more upward pressure on core inflation.
 Energy prices are projected to decline at an annual rate of 28 percent over the
first half of this year and then to rise somewhat faster than core prices over the
remainder of the projection period. Meanwhile, after running below core
inflation in 2015 and early 2016, food prices are expected to rise slightly
faster than core prices over the medium term. As a result, total PCE inflation,
at 0.7 percent, runs below core PCE inflation this year but moves a little above
core inflation thereafter and reaches 2 percent in 2018.
 Compared with the December Tealbook, core PCE inflation is 0.1 percentage
point lower in both 2016 and 2017; total PCE inflation is 0.5 percentage point
lower in 2016 and 0.1 percentage point lower in 2017. The downward
revisions to inflation mainly reflect the lower import and energy prices in this
projection.

 Average hourly earnings were unchanged in December and rose 2½ percent
over 2015 as a whole, about ½ percentage point more than in 2014. In the
near term, we expect the 12-month change in this measure to be between
2¼ and 2½ percent.
 We continue to expect business-sector hourly compensation, which rose an
outsized 3½ percent over the four quarters ending in 2015:Q3, to decelerate
over the next few quarters. By the end of the medium-term projection, gains
in compensation per hour pick back up to around 3¼ percent, little changed
from the previous projection.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
As described in the box “Changes to the Long-Term Outlook Procedure,” we
have simplified the model used to generate the long-term outlook in this Tealbook. The
changes in procedure had no material effect on the projection of the key variables we
highlight here.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.
The SOMA portfolio is projected to return to a normal size by the end
of 2021.
 The federal funds rate rises further after 2018. With real GDP above its
potential level in the medium term and inflation having essentially reached the
Committee’s 2 percent objective, the federal funds rate moves above its long-
run normal value in 2019 and 2020.

Changes to the Long‐Term Outlook Procedure
&
l
e
e
v
In this Tealbook, the staff has introduced a new model to produce the long‐term
D
outlook for the U.S. economy—currently, for 2019 and beyond. The following
n
o discussion explains the motivation for changing the model and describes the new
c
E procedure.
c
i
t
s
e Previously, the long‐term outlook was based on a version of the FRB/US model that had
m
o been adapted to more closely mimic some aspects of the staff’s framework for the
D
medium run, particularly Okun’s law and the Phillips curve. However, with the
hundreds of variables and exogenous factors in the FRB/US model, the task of creating
a long‐horizon forecast was challenging and time consuming.
Given that detailed aspects of the outlook many years ahead are generally not of
interest, it seemed advantageous to develop a simpler model that focuses on a few key
variables and a small set of factors that determine the values of those variables over the
long run. Our new procedure generates a long‐term projection with the same
standards of quality as before but at a much lower cost. The new model is focused on
the variables currently in the “Long‐Term Outlook” exhibit in DEDO: real and potential
GDP, the unemployment rate and its natural rate, overall and core PCE price inflation,
the federal funds rate, the 10‐year Treasury yield, and the triple‐B corporate bond rate.
The model has five main components. First, the model uses an Okun’s law relationship
to link the unemployment rate to the output gap. Second, the model includes a Phillips
curve in which core inflation is determined by the unemployment gap and long‐term
inflation expectations. Third, the model uses a Taylor rule to generate the path of the
federal funds rate; this rule is the same as the one we use in putting together the
medium‐term forecast. Fourth, the model builds a forecast of long‐term interest rates
using the expectations hypothesis of the term structure (assuming model‐consistent
expectations) and a term premium that moves with the business cycle. These four
components are largely unchanged from the previous model we used. The major
change relative to our previous procedure concerns the relationship between
aggregate spending and long‐term real interest rates. Rather than relying on a large
number of spending equations in the FRB/US model, the new procedure links the
output gap directly to long‐term real interest rates using a relationship analogous to a
textbook “forward‐looking IS curve.” A key advantage of the new approach is that the
forces influencing the outlook can be summarized by a handful of easily interpretable
factors rather than the many driving forces embedded in the FRB/US model.
Importantly, we have compared the results from our new procedure with those from
the previous model for the current and several previous Tealbooks. For the key
macroeconomic variables in the long‐term outlook, the results from the two models are
very similar.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The recent increase in financial market volatility, centered on developments in
China and global commodity markets, underscores the headwinds and challenges
weighing on the outlook for global economic growth. In addition to the risks and
uncertainties facing China, these challenges include persistent sluggishness in global
trade and manufacturing and the implications of the continuing decline in commodity
prices for commodity-producing economies. Moreover, cross-border and domestic credit
flows in the emerging market economies (EMEs) have slowed, in some cases quite k
o
o
l
sharply. And Japan and Europe are struggling to raise inflation from quite low levels, as t
u
O
policy rates are near zero. These factors contributed to lackluster foreign growth
&
l
throughout 2015 and weigh on prospects going forward. Nevertheless, our baseline e
v
e
D
outlook for a return of foreign growth to more normal levels over the forecast period,
n
o
while marked down a bit in the near term, remains essentially intact. We interpret the c
E
l
market volatility of recent weeks as primarily reflecting investor concerns about t ’
n
I
downside risks to the global economy.
We estimate fourth-quarter foreign real GDP grew at a subdued 2 percent
annualized pace, down from 2½ percent in the third quarter and about ¼ percent below
the forecast in the December Tealbook. The slower growth primarily reflected further
drag from low oil prices in Canada and a deceleration in Mexico’s economy as U.S.
manufacturing growth stepped down. Foreign growth is expected to turn back up, albeit
somewhat more slowly over the first half of 2016 than in our December projection, as the
recent declines in oil and equity prices, along with tighter credit conditions in the EMEs,
weigh on the near-term outlook. As in our previous forecasts, foreign growth reaches
3 percent—near its trend rate—by late 2016 and maintains that pace through 2018.
Growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) is supported by continuing policy
accommodation, past currency depreciation, gradually improving credit market
conditions, and, for Japan and Europe, low oil prices. In the EMEs, the South American
economies gradually pull out of their slumps, and emerging Asia is supported by the
combination of firmer exports to the advanced economies, accommodative policy, and
lower oil prices.

In contrast to the more dire concerns highlighted by the recent turmoil in financial
markets, our baseline expectation is premised on China’s economy decelerating only
moderately and on the renminbi depreciating only somewhat further in the quarters
ahead. Notwithstanding the Chinese authorities’ recent clumsy communications and
sometimes surprising policy actions, we think that the authorities will resist large
currency moves, in part to damp capital outflows, and we do not see the currency as
significantly overvalued. Moreover, the Chinese authorities continue to have at their
disposal a broad array of policy tools to respond to market strains or shortfalls in growth.
However, given the complex challenges facing China, a more adverse outturn cannot be
k
o
o
l ruled out. In particular, as explored in the “China-Driven Emerging Market Economy
t
u
O
Crisis” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section, a financial crisis and sharp
&
l weakening of growth in China could produce severe adverse spillovers for other EMEs
e
v
e
D and the global economy. And further weakness in overall foreign growth could lead to
n
o the pressures laid out in the scenario “Stronger Dollar and Lower Oil Prices.” Beyond
c
E
l the standard macroeconomic channels highlighted in this scenario, lower oil prices could
’
t
n
I also lead to financial stresses in the oil sector here and abroad and additional drag
on growth.
We estimate that inflation fell to near zero in the AFEs in the fourth quarter, as
retail energy prices declined further. The additional drop in oil prices since the
December Tealbook is expected to hold AFE inflation near zero again in the first quarter.
Thereafter, AFE inflation is projected to rise to close to 1 percent by the middle of the
year, as energy prices stabilize, and then to increase gradually to 1¾ percent by the end of
the forecast period as economic slack diminishes. In the EMEs, inflation fell to an
estimated 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower retail energy and food prices,
but we see it rising to a 3 percent trend pace by the second half of 2016.
We have revised our monetary policy expectations in light of the weaker inflation
and growth outlooks for the AFEs. We now expect the Bank of Canada (BOC) to lower
its policy rate 25 basis points at its March meeting and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to
expand its asset purchase program by the middle of the year. We have also pushed back
our forecast for the Bank of England (BOE) to begin raising rates by one quarter, to the

third quarter of 2016. We have not changed our baseline for the European Central Bank
(ECB), but we see an increased probability of additional stimulus measures. In contrast,
we have raised our forecasts for policy rate increases for several commodity-producing
EMEs experiencing currency weakness and above-target inflation, including Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, and Russia.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Chinese real GDP growth edged down from 7¼ percent in the third
k
quarter to 7 percent in the fourth, slightly higher than our December Tealbook o
o
l
t
forecast, as a retrenchment in service sector growth offset a modest pickup in u
O
manufacturing activity. Consistent with the solid GDP print, industrial &
l
e
production, exports, and retail sales have all been relatively strong, although v
e
D
investment continues to slow. For 2015 as a whole, China’s economy grew
n
o
c
6.9 percent, a hair under the authorities’ target and only a modest deceleration E
l
’
from 7¼ percent growth in 2014. Notwithstanding a resurgence of volatility n t
I
in China’s financial markets during the intermeeting period, we do not see a
precipitous slowing of the economy as the most likely scenario (see the box
“Recent Developments in China and Implications for the Outlook”). Growth
is expected to continue its gradual decline to 6 percent by the end of the
forecast period, in line with our estimate of China’s potential growth rate.
This forecast is little changed from the December Tealbook.
After turning slightly negative in the fourth quarter, inflation in China is
projected to pick up going forward. Although recent declines in oil prices are
expected to hold down inflation over the next few quarters, we see inflation
settling at 2½ percent by the end of this year. We expect the authorities to
support growth primarily through fiscal easing and credit policy, which are
likely to be adjusted in response to the performance of the economy over the
course of the year, and to make one additional cut to the benchmark lending
rate. The authorities are also likely to reduce reserve requirements as

Recent Developments in China and Implications for the Outlook
Since the start of the year, global financial markets have again been roiled by
developments in China. An apparent change in the management of the Chinese
exchange rate on the first trading day of the year led to concerns about the economy and
a sharp decline in Chinese equity markets, triggering newly minted circuit breakers.
Pressure on Chinese markets has continued, leaving the onshore value of the renminbi
(RMB) 1¼ percent weaker against the dollar and equity prices down 16 percent so far this
year. Tenuous stabilization of Chinese markets appears to have been achieved but only
through significant government intervention in equity and foreign exchange markets,
and questions remain about Chinese policy direction and risks to the global economy.
k
o Market developments notwithstanding, recent official data do not point to a significant
o
l slowing in Chinese growth. Although the year started with a weaker-than-expected
t
u
O reading on the unofficial Caixin PMI for December, other Chinese data—such as industrial
& production and exports—have been relatively strong. The stability of these indicators
e l was confirmed by the subsequent release of fourth-quarter GDP, which printed about in
v
e line with expectations. All told, we have left our forecast for GDP growth in China about
D
unchanged, with growth slowing from about 7 percent in 2015 to 6½ percent this year
n
o and 6 percent by 2018. Outside analysts also do not appear to have significantly revised
c
E down their baseline outlook for China.
l
’
t
n
I Instead, the global market volatility related to China appears to reflect increasing worries
about downside risks to the Chinese economy and the coherence of Chinese
policymaking. Authorities seem to be struggling to balance the goals of liberalizing
markets and maintaining stability. Nowhere has that tension been more tangible, or the
spillovers to global markets stronger, than in relation to China’s exchange rate policy. In
August, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) changed the way it sets its fixing rate (the red
dots in figure 1) by tying it more closely to the previous day’s close (the black line), which
signaled that the exchange rate would more closely reflect market conditions. (The
fixing rate serves as the midpoint and thus anchors the plus/minus 2 percent daily trading
band.) In response to a consequent surge in capital outflows and market turmoil,
38 of 94

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Internal (FR) January 20, 2016
however, the PBOC intervened to stabilize the RMB, apparently contradicting its earlier
intent. In December, the PBOC began publishing a new multilateral exchange rate index
and indicated that it expected the RMB to be “basically stable” relative to the currency
basket. But the PBOC never clarified whether, and to what degree, it had adopted a
policy of pegging the RMB to that basket, nor did it reconcile that policy with the goal of
giving more weight to market forces. Accordingly, in early January when authorities
fixed the exchange rate both weaker against the dollar and weaker against the basket
than the previous market’s close , as shown in figure 2, investors took this as a signal that
the RMB would be allowed to depreciate more sharply, setting off renewed turmoil in
global markets. In consequence, the authorities once again acted to stabilize the RMB.
We estimate that the PBOC has spent nearly $400 billion defending the currency during
the past year—although, at $3.4 trillion, its reserves remain ample.
k
o
The authorities are clearly having trouble reconciling a large number of sometimes o
l
t
inconsistent objectives: (1) containing appreciation of the effective RMB that would u
O
accompany a further rise in the dollar, (2) preventing a large, disorderly depreciation of
&
the currency, (3) maintaining reserves amid strengthening capital outflows, and (4) giving
l
e
greater sway to market forces. Balancing these goals will be difficult, and attempts to v
e
accommodate downward pressure on the RMB by allowing some modest depreciation D
will further incentivize outflows and currency pressures. We project the RMB to n
o
depreciate further through the middle of this year, both against the dollar and the basket c
E
(black and red lines in figure 2), before flattening out for a period as investors come to l
’
t
realize a hard landing is not imminent. However, much more extreme outcomes are n
I
certainly possible.
Spillovers from the turmoil in China along with falling commodity prices—the latter due
at least in part to concerns over global demand—have weighed on global financial
markets, and advanced and emerging market equity indexes posted sharp declines in
January. Although wealth effects from lower equity prices are small in most foreign
economies, lower oil prices led us to mark down growth in key trading partners, including
Canada and Mexico, leaving a negative imprint on our near-term outlook for trade-
weighted foreign GDP.
The outlook for the U.S. economy has also been affected, primarily for the worse. The
drag on some countries from falling commodity prices, the appreciation of the dollar
since the previous Tealbook, and our assumption of further RMB depreciation (with
knock-on effects to the projected path of other EME Asian currencies) have all lowered
our forecast for net exports. In addition, declines in U.S. equities, which have been linked
to concerns over the foreign outlook and increased risk aversion, have a negative wealth
effect that lowers U.S. GDP. These negative effects are somewhat balanced by the
positive effect of the decline in oil prices on domestic consumption, notwithstanding
some additional downward pressure on oil-sector investment. All told, these effects sum
up to a fairly small drag on U.S. growth over the next few years, with the higher dollar
and lower oil prices also pushing down inflation in the first half of 2016. That said, the
prospect of a further sharp depreciation of the RMB and a steep downturn in Chinese
activity could potentially have very large effects on U.S. GDP growth and inflation, a
scenario considered in the Risks and Uncertainty section.

necessary to offset the monetary effects of continuing large-scale foreign
exchange sales, but we do not see such actions as providing net stimulus.
 Other Emerging Asia. We estimate fourth-quarter growth edged down to
3½ percent, in line with our December forecast. This slowdown is due partly
to weaker activity in Korea after the third-quarter rebound following the end
of the MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak and partly to
deceleration in India following unusually strong growth in the third quarter.
Elsewhere in the region, growth has generally held up; high-frequency
k
o
indicators such as PMI and retail sales suggest that domestic demand is
o
l
t
u
picking up, even as exports, especially to China, continue to disappoint.
O
&
Overall, we expect growth to step up to 4¼ percent this year, supported
l
e
v
e initially by stronger domestic demand and later by more robust growth abroad.
D
n
o
c We expect inflation in the region to remain at 2½ percent in the current
E
l
t ’ quarter as the continued fall in energy prices is offset by higher food prices.
n
I
We see inflation moving up gradually to 3¼ percent by 2017.
 Latin America. Real GDP growth in Mexico stepped down ¾ percentage
point to an estimated 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, ¼ percentage point
below our December projection. The deceleration reflects, in part, weaker
external demand, as Mexican manufacturing exports declined. Also,
investment in nonresidential structures plunged further in October, driven by
oil price declines. In contrast, private consumption moved up, aided by rising
employment, accommodative monetary policy, and higher disposable income
as government reforms have pushed down energy and telecommunications
prices. We see growth gradually moving up to 3 percent by 2018. The
outlook for the Mexican economy is a little weaker than in the previous
Tealbook, reflecting the downward revision to expected U.S. manufacturing
production and lower oil prices.
Headline inflation dropped to 2½ percent in the fourth quarter, driven by
another plunge in telecommunications prices. We see inflation moving back

up to 3¼ percent by the second quarter and then sustaining that rate. The
Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate to 3.25 percent following Fed liftoff, and
we expect the central bank to broadly shadow changes in Federal Reserve
policy rates going forward.
In Brazil, persistent political tensions and the associated uncertainty about the
fiscal outlook, depressed commodity prices, continuing reverberations of the
scandal at Petrobras, and ongoing monetary policy tightening led real GDP to
contract at an estimated annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter. While
k
exports and the PMI improved somewhat late in the fourth quarter, industrial o
o
l
t
production and consumer and business confidence fell further. We expect u
O
growth to remain in negative territory this year and to resume expanding at an &
l
e
anemic pace in 2017, aided by a weaker currency and firming global growth. v
e
D
n
Despite the weak economy, the substantial depreciation of the real and hikes o
c
E
in administered prices kept inflation at a 10¼ percent annual rate in the fourth ’ l
t
n
I
quarter. We see inflation declining to 5½ percent by mid-2017, reflecting
continued tight monetary policy and lower pressure from administered prices.
We expect that the continued elevated pace of inflation will prompt the central
bank to resume policy tightening at this week’s meeting. We do not expect
policy to begin easing until late 2016.
In Argentina, the administration of newly elected President Mauricio Macri
moved to begin tackling the country’s serious economic problems and restore
its access to global capital markets. The government laid out a four-year
economic plan to reduce the fiscal deficit and bring inflation down to
5 percent by the end of 2019. The exchange rate system was unified, and the
official exchange rate was allowed to depreciate by 40 percent; export taxes
were repealed; and talks with holders of defaulted debt began in January.
In Venezuela, whose economy has been ravaged by economic
mismanagement and the collapse in oil prices, President Nicolás Maduro has
decreed a 90-day economic emergency, a measure that would grant him broad
41 of 94

--- Page 45 ---

C lass II FOMC - Internal (FR) January 20, 2016
powers to enact new economic measures. The opposition-controlled congress
is poised to reject the decree, however, and political tensions will likely
intensify in coming weeks. Meanwhile, the government released a year’s
worth of macroeconomic data showing that economic activity is extremely
depressed, with GDP declining 7 percent on a four-quarter basis through the
third quarter. And inflation has soared further into three-digit territory,
exceeding 140 percent on a 12-month basis in September.
 Other EMEs. In South Africa, financial markets have come under pressure,
k
o
as two finance ministers were dismissed within a week, and concerns mounted
o
l
t
u
over South Africa’s dependence on commodity exports and its reliance on
O
&
portfolio inflows to finance large external deficits. The country also continues
l
e
v
e to suffer from low growth and elevated inflation. Since the December
D
n Tealbook, the rand has fallen by about 15 percent and the CDS premium is up
o
c
E around 85 basis points.

I
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Canada. We have slashed our estimate of fourth-quarter growth in Canada to
only ½ percent, from 2 percent in the December Tealbook. Incoming
indicators point to weaker momentum and a larger drag from low oil prices
than we had previously thought: Business investment, manufacturing output,
and construction activity contracted in the fourth quarter, and growth in the
service sector slowed. The weak incoming data and further declines in oil
prices have led us to also lower our projection ¾ percentage point for the first
half of 2016. We do not expect the weakness to be sustained, and we have
growth picking up to just over 2 percent later in 2016 and in 2017, as
investment recovers, exports are supported by past currency depreciation,
monetary policy remains accommodative, and the recently elected
government implements fiscal stimulus.
We estimate that inflation declined from 2¼ percent in the third quarter to
¾ percent in the fourth. As the drag from lower oil prices fades, inflation is
42 of 94

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
C lass II FOMC - Internal (FR) January 20, 2016
projected to step up to 1¾ percent in the second half of 2016, reaching the
BOC’s target of 2 percent by mid-2017. In response to the weaker economic
outlook, we now expect the BOC to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points at its
March meeting.
 Euro Area. Recent indicators suggest real GDP grew 1¼ percent in the fourth
quarter. Going forward, the boost from the recent fall in oil prices should
more than offset the drag from the recent declines in equity prices. We expect
GDP to rise at about a 2 percent rate over the next three years, a touch higher
k
than in the December Tealbook, supported by ongoing monetary stimulus, o
o
l
t
past currency depreciation, low oil prices, and easing credit conditions. u
O
&
Headline inflation stayed slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to another e l
v
e
plunge in retail energy prices and a moderate decrease in core inflation. As D
n
o
the drag from energy prices moderates and the output gap narrows, we expect
c
E
inflation to step up to 1½ percent by late 2016 and to edge up a bit further ’ l
t
n
I
thereafter. Compared with the December Tealbook, this projection is about
1 percentage point lower in the first half of 2016, largely due to declines in
energy prices. We continue to expect the ECB to purchase assets through
mid-2017 and to keep its policy rates at current low levels until late 2018.
However, the recent lowering of the near-term inflation outlook, along with
recent declines in longer-term inflation compensation, raise the possibility that
the ECB will undertake further stimulus.
 Japan. Growth in the fourth quarter is estimated to have remained around
1 percent. The recent appreciation of the yen should damp export growth, but
the decline in oil prices should provide an offsetting boost to consumption.
All told, we still expect that GDP growth will stay around 1 percent in 2016,
supported by ongoing monetary easing and low oil prices, before a second
hike in the consumption tax temporarily stalls the expansion in 2017.
We estimate that consumer prices fell ¼ percent last quarter, largely reflecting
falling retail energy prices, but that core inflation held steady at just under
43 of 94

--- Page 47 ---

C lass II FOMC - Internal (FR) January 20, 2016
1 percent. We project that inflation (excluding the direct effect of the 2017
consumption tax hike) will rise to 1 percent by the end of 2016 and to
1¼ percent in 2017 and 2018. With inflation well below the BOJ’s 2 percent
target, and given the recent substantial oil price declines and appreciation of
the yen, we now expect that the BOJ will expand its asset purchase program
by midyear.
 United Kingdom. Recent indicators, such as PMIs for services and
construction, retail sales, and economic sentiment, point to solid growth in
k
o
domestic demand, which has offset some of the weakness in external demand.
o
l
t
u
We expect GDP growth to pick up from 1¾ percent in the third quarter to
O
&
2¼ percent in the fourth and to average just above that pace over the next
l
e
v
e three years. We also expect that uncertainty about the referendum on U.K.
D
n membership in the European Union (EU), which could take place as soon as
o
c
E the middle of this year, will weigh on activity. But, because our baseline
l
’
t
n assumption is of continued EU membership, this effect should be temporary
I
and largely offset by the boost from recent declines in oil prices and the
foreign exchange value of the pound.
Because of declining energy prices, consumer prices fell 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, and we expect them to rise by ½ percent this quarter,
½ percentage point below the December forecast. As energy prices stabilize
and the economy continues to expand, we project that inflation will step up to
a 2 percent pace by late 2016. In response to BOE communications focusing
on recent slower wage growth and uncertainties about the global economy, we
now expect the BOE to wait until the third quarter of 2016 to begin raising its
policy rate, one quarter later than assumed in the December Tealbook.

Financial Developments
Stock prices tumbled worldwide over the intermeeting period, as the post-year-
end turmoil in Chinese financial markets and the continued slide in oil prices stoked
global growth concerns and increased risk aversion. The decline in the prices of risky
assets after year-end weighed on policy rate expectations both domestically and abroad,
and market-based measures of forward inflation compensation fell to record lows.
Corporate credit quality showed some further signs of deterioration, and speculative-
grade issuance slowed to a near halt. Financing conditions for high-credit-quality
businesses and households, though, apparently remained accommodative.
Following the Committee’s decision at the December meeting to raise the target
range for the federal funds rate, the effective federal funds rate rose to the middle of the
new target range and other overnight market rates moved up largely in line. Otherwise,
the FOMC statement elicited little market reaction.
• The Shanghai composite index dropped 14 percent over the intermeeting
period, and the renminbi depreciated 1(cid:1152) percent against the dollar, despite
reports of repeated intervention in both markets by Chinese authorities.

survey by the end of 2016 is now 0.80 percent, implying one less rate hike
compared with the December survey.

• TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation declined, with the 5-to-10-
year measure of TIPS-based inflation compensation hitting a new low.
• Yield spreads on both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds
widened, in part owing to another jump in energy-sector spreads. CMBS
spreads widened further.
• Banks’ lending standards reportedly tightened for business loans, on net, but
eased for several categories of loans to households during the fourth quarter.
Loan demand reportedly increased across most major loan categories.1
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
After little discernible reaction following the liftoff of U.S. policy interest rates,
global financial market conditions deteriorated sharply in January, as developments in
Chinese financial markets and another step-down in oil prices appeared to ignite fears
about global growth. This shift in sentiment led to a pronounced decline in the prices of
equities and other risky assets and a notable strengthening of the dollar.
On January 4 and again on January 7, Chinese authorities set a weaker-than-
expected central parity for the exchange rate of the renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. Fears
that this action foreshadowed further renminbi depreciation spooked investors, and stock s
t
n
prices in China fell sharply. Since the December FOMC meeting, the Shanghai e
m
p
composite index has dropped 14 percent despite reports of repeated stock purchases by o

e
government-directed institutions. Chinese authorities also appear to have intervened v

on global financial markets. Equity prices in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and
emerging market economies (EMEs) fell sharply, with stock indexes down about

8 percent and 10 percent in the euro area and Japan, respectively. AFE 10-year sovereign
yields decreased substantially, with almost all of the decline due to a drop in inflation
compensation. Policy expectations for major foreign central banks, which had risen some
after the December FOMC meeting, ended the period down. EME credit spreads
widened, but outflows from EME-dedicated mutual funds remained moderate.
The U.S. dollar appreciated further against most currencies, leaving the broad
index of the dollar up 2¾ percent. The dollar was little changed, on net, against the euro
but appreciated about 6 percent versus sterling and the Canadian dollar. The dollar
appreciated up to 3 percent against most Asian EME currencies, which generally moved
in sympathy with the renminbi, and a bit more versus several Latin American currencies.
In contrast, the dollar depreciated against the Japanese yen, which was likely supported
by flight-to-safety flows, including some unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS
The Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to
¼ to ½ percent at the December meeting elicited little reaction in Treasury and interest
rate futures markets, as market participants had appeared reasonably sure that liftoff
would occur in December. The changes to the forward-guidance language in the FOMC
statement were similarly reported as consistent with market expectations that future
s
t
n
adjustments to the target range would be data dependent but likely gradual. The
e
m
December FOMC minutes also prompted limited market reaction. Market participants p
o
l
place essentially no odds on the next rate increase occurring at the January meeting. e
v
e
Based on a straight read of federal funds futures rates, the perceived odds of a rate hike D
l
a
by the March meeting declined in the intermeeting period from around 50 percent to i
c
n
about 30 percent. Positive news regarding December payrolls was overshadowed by a
n
i
global growth concerns and negative domestic spending indicators. F
The market-based expected path of the federal funds rate 12 to 24 months out
flattened over the intermeeting period and continues to lie noticeably below survey-based
expectations. (See the box “Negative Risk Premiums and the Federal Funds Path
Puzzle.”) Similarly, the expected path of the federal funds rate according to the Desk’s
January Surveys of Primary Dealers has declined. The expected year-end 2016 target
federal funds rate moved down to 0.8 percent, suggesting dealers anticipate one less rate
hike by the end of the year compared with the December survey. Survey participants

Negative Risk Premiums and the Federal Funds Path Puzzle
The market price implied path of the federal funds rate over the medium term stands well
below most survey-based measures of the trajectory of the federal funds rate (figure 1). In
part, the gap could indicate that the path of the federal funds rate expected by market
participants differs materially from that expected by survey respondents.1 We explore the
possibility that survey measures of policy expectations may, in fact, be reasonably well
aligned with market expectations and that the gap between the federal funds futures
curve and the surveys largely reflects a substantial negative risk premium.
A number of standard models suggest that negative risk premiums can arise in some
environments. The general intuition of such models is that investors are willing to accept
low returns on assets that have high payoffs during “bad times” when positive payoffs are
particularly valuable. This intuition suggests that investors may value federal funds futures
contracts partly because they help insure against the risk of recession on the assumption
that the FOMC will lower the federal funds rate in recessions or periods of unexpectedly
low growth.
We use three models from the macro-finance literature to illustrate the potential
magnitude of this negative premium.2 The first model, a variant of the “habit persistence”
model developed by Campbell and Cochrane (1999), assumes that a representative
investor’s marginal utility and risk aversion increase sharply during recessions as
consumption weakens.3 We modify the model to include monetary policy that follows an
inertial Taylor (1999) rule, with the implication that the federal funds rate falls during
recessions, generating insurance value for federal funds futures contracts. Under this

1 Alternative explanations include Illiquidity or other imperfections in financial market prices. The
December 2015 Tealbook discussed several possibilities (see the box “The Federal Funds Rate Path:
Market Expectations and Risk Scenarios” in Book B).
2 Our goal in this exercise is not to calibrate the models to match the observed gap between survey
expectations and futures rates. Rather, we use standard calibrations to the extent possible to determine
what the models imply for the risk premium on federal funds futures rates under fairly typical
parameterizations.

Aggregate Stock Market Behavior,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 107 (April), pp. 205–51.

model, to infer market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate from market
prices, one must “correct” federal funds futures rates by adding back the model-implied
negative risk premium. The habit model line in figure 2 plots the market-expected path of
the federal funds rate generated by this procedure. The risk premium correction is
substantial under the habit model in the present circumstance. Indeed, the magnitude of
the implied risk premium is about one-half of the observed gap between the actual futures
path (solid red line) and survey-based expectations (blue dots). Under this model, the
premium is presently larger than average in magnitude because aggregate consumption
remains low relative to its pre-crisis trend, and investor risk aversion thus remains high.4
The second model is based on the “long-run risk” (LRR) model of Bansal and Yaron (2004),
which we also modify to include the Taylor rule.5 In this model, macroeconomic
uncertainty increases during recessions, increasing the magnitude of risk premiums. As
shown by the LRR model line, this model also prescribes a large correction to federal funds
futures rates due to the presence of a relatively large negative risk premium. The key
ingredient for this result is that the level of uncertainty regarding the growth rate of
consumption is somewhat higher than average.
Monetary policy was exogenously specified in the first two models; in contrast, the third
model, based on Diercks (2015), combines the long-run risk specification with the New
Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) literature and assumes fully
endogenous monetary policy, consumption, and asset prices.6 As shown by the DSGE
model line, this model also predicts a sizable negative risk premium at the end of 2018.
As discussed earlier, the risk premium in these models stems from a positive correlation
between the federal funds rate and consumption. That correlation may hold up well s
t
during periods when economic fluctuations are driven largely by “demand shocks.” n
e
m
However, the risk premium could be quite different during periods when high interest
p
rates are associated with weak economic activity. While the results from these models are o
l
e
suggestive, there are some caveats that should be noted. First, more work is necessary to v
e
develop estimates of term premiums that can capture realistic behavior over time using D
l
these models. Second, these models suggest that, at present, we should observe relatively a
i
c
high risk premiums for other assets that could suffer losses during recessions, such as n
a
corporate equities and bonds. Measuring such risk premiums is very difficult; by some n
i
F
estimates, risk premiums for these assets are currently somewhat elevated. However,
other estimates of risk premiums for such assets are not especially high. Developing
models that can account for the linkages in risk premiums across asset classes is an
important area for future research.
4 In general, this model requires extremely high levels of investor risk aversion to match the average
levels of other risk premiums observed in the economy, such as the equity risk premium.

view 1.3 percent to be the most likely level of the federal funds rate at which the timing
of the Committee’s reinvestment policy will change.
Consistent with the decline in fed funds futures rates, nominal Treasury yields
decreased over the intermeeting period. Part of the decline likely reflected lower term
premiums related to global growth concerns following Chinese developments and the
continued slide in oil prices. Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities
decreased 12, 23, and 22 basis points, respectively. Meanwhile, near-term uncertainty
about longer-term interest rates, as measured by swaption-implied volatilities on the
10-year swap rate, was little changed on net.
The 5- and 5-to-10-year measures of TIPS-based inflation compensation moved
down 11 basis points and 17 basis points, respectively, largely in line with declining oil
prices, pushing the far-term measure to a new low. Inflation compensation measures
based on inflation swaps posted similar declines.
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS
Broad U.S. stock price indexes fell 8½ percent since the December FOMC
meeting, largely in sync with oil prices and equity markets around the world. In addition
to energy and basic materials, banks and technology were among the hardest-hit sectors.

U.S. firms with high international sales exposure decreased more than those with low n t

mostly reflecting their seasonal pattern, but have since normalized.
Reflecting primarily the slump in the energy and materials sectors, corporate
earnings continued to show signs of weakness. Based on our most recent read of Wall
Street analysts’ earnings forecasts, fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have declined

slightly from year-ago levels. Excluding oil and gas firms, earnings appear to have
increased modestly.
Credit quality of nonfinancial businesses continued to show signs of deterioration.
Through the third quarter, the aggregate ratio of debt to assets climbed further to its
highest level since the early 1990s. The volume of nonfinancial bonds downgraded by
Moody’s Investors Service outpaced the volume of upgrades again in December.
Downgrades continued to plague speculative-grade issuers in the energy sector, but, even
outside the energy sector, downgrades outpaced upgrades. The Moody’s KMV expected
year-ahead default rate continued to increase and is near the upper range of its
distribution outside of recessions. In the most recent SLOOS, on net, a significant
number of banks expected a worsening of the performance of loans to larger firms over
2016, especially syndicated leveraged loans.
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE
Financing conditions for riskier firms tightened somewhat but remained
accommodative for highly rated firms. In December and early January, investment-grade
bond issuance remained robust, while speculative-grade bond issuance was weak. In the
most recent SLOOS, on net, a moderate number of banks reported tightening C&I loans
to large and middle-market firms, and a significant number of banks reported tightening

spreads on the riskiest loans in their portfolios. Banks that reported tightening standards

as one of the reasons. Both initial and seasoned equity offerings also continued to be e

The decline in issuance was particularly pronounced for relatively risky leveraged loans a

While overall financing conditions for CRE remained fairly accommodative and
credit continued to flow smoothly into the sector, financing conditions tightened
somewhat over the intermeeting period. In CMBS markets, spreads continued to widen
but CMBS issuance for December continued apace. In the most recent SLOOS, on net, a
moderate number of banks reported tightening standards on CRE loans in the fourth
quarter. Nevertheless, the growth of CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets remained
robust through the fourth quarter.

Financing conditions for municipalities stayed generally stable. Over the
intermeeting period, the general obligation (GO) municipal bond yield spread was little
changed, even as Puerto Rico continued to experience financial stress. As expected, the
commonwealth made principal and interest payments on its GO debt due January 1 but
defaulted on a small amount of bonds issued by its infrastructure and development
institutions.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed and
remained accommodative on balance. Since liftoff, interest rates on variable-rate credit
cards have ticked lower, while those on new auto loans are little changed. Spreads on
consumer loan ABS, which fund a moderate portion of these consumer loans, have
stabilized at somewhat elevated levels after widening earlier last year.
Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace through November,
reflecting a further expansion in credit card balances and robust increases in auto and
student loan balances. Student and auto loans remained broadly available, even to
borrowers with subprime credit histories. In contrast, lending standards on credit card
loans continued to be relatively tight for riskier borrowers. In response to the SLOOS,
banks indicated, on net, that over the past three months they had eased standards and
s
t

terms on auto loans and tightened standards and terms on credit card loans. A significant

Credit conditions for residential mortgages were little changed over the a l

credit remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or F i
high debt-to-income ratios. A number of banks reported in the SLOOS that they had
eased standards on several types of home mortgages over the past three months, and that
they expected to ease standards further this year.

auto and other consumer loans grew at a faster pace. Large banks continued to build up
holdings of agency MBS and reduce holdings of Treasury securities.
Over the intermeeting period, stock prices of large domestic BHCs substantially
underperformed the broader market, but CDS spreads increased only modestly. Of those
large banks that have reported earnings, the majority have met or exceeded analysts’
earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter; large bank profitability improved a bit despite
increases in loss provisions for oil-related loans and persistent pressures on net interest
margins from low interest rates. However, market participants primarily focused on the
exposure of banks to declines in oil prices and global growth concerns.
M2 expanded at an average annual rate of around 6 percent over November and
December, continuing the moderate growth seen over the second half of 2015. The pass-
through of the increase in the general level of short-term rates to retail deposit rates has
been limited to date.
FEDERAL RESERVEOPERATIONS AND SHORT-TERMFUNDING MARKETS
Following the increase in the target range for the policy rate, the effective federal
funds and Eurodollar rates traded within a range of 35 to 37 basis points, in the middle of
the target range.2 The overnight repo rate for Treasury collateral, as surveyed by the
s
Desk, increased to about 30 basis points in the days following the FOMC meeting. n t
e
m
p
Subsequently, in response to typical year-end pressures, the fed funds and o
l
e
v
Eurodollar rates dipped below the target range, to 20 basis points on year-end. The e
D
decline in unsecured rates was somewhat larger than the drops observed on recent l
a
i
c
quarter-ends, likely reflecting reduced support from the zero lower bound. The average n
a
n
financing rate for primary dealers increased a few basis points, while the increase in the
i
F
GCF repo rate was more pronounced. Following year-end, pressures in money markets
quickly abated.
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 34 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the
intraday standard deviation averaging 5.3 basis points. On March 2, 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York will change the data source for the calculation of the effective federal funds rate from
aggregated data provided by federal funds brokers to individual federal funds transactions reported by
depository institutions in the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420). The effective federal
funds rate will be calculated as a volume-weighted median rate, as opposed to the current volume-weighted
average rate.

Take-up of RRPs was almost unchanged immediately following the increase in
the policy rate and continued to be explained by the spread of the ON RRP offering rate
to comparable money market rates. Demand rose steadily in the days leading up to year-
end, with ON RRPs outstanding reaching $475 billion on December 31, consistent with
recent quarter-ends. Demand for term RRPs was nearly nil, as there was ample capacity
in the overnight RRP facility and term RRPs were not offered at any premium over
overnight RRPs. More recently, overnight take-up fell to under $100 billion.
The Desk purchased about $21 billion of 15- and 30-year MBS under the
reinvestment program and rolled $0.9 billion in expected settlements over the period. The
ratio of monthly settlements for these reinvestment operations relative to gross issuance
of MBS was roughly unchanged in December at about 30 percent.3

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth, the
unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in line with the average over the past
20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility in real activity but relatively stable
inflation. We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our GDP projection are
tilted to the downside and that the risks to our unemployment projection are tilted to the
upside, both because we view neither monetary nor fiscal policy as well positioned to
offset large adverse shocks to the economy, and—a consideration that has recently
become even more salient—b ecause of downside risks emanating from abroad. Our
concerns with respect to inflation remain mostly to the downside given the low levels of
market-based measures of inflation compensation, hints from some surveys of lower
longer-term inflation expectations, and the possibility that the realization of the downside
risks to economies abroad may put upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the
dollar.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the financial vulnerabilities of the
U.S. financial system as moderate. This assessment reflects strong capital and liquidity
positions at banks, moderate leverage in the nonbank financial sector, and subdued
borrowing by households. While valuation pressures in corporate debt markets have
eased to a significant degree over the past year amid a pullback in appetite for credit risk,
leverage has continued to increase not just for oil-related firms and riskier segments of
the nonfinancial business sector, but also more broadly. High leverage of nonfinancial
corporations and liquidity mismatch at high-yield bond mutual funds suggest elevated
risks for bond investors and lower-rated borrowers.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
y
t
n
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of i
a
t
r
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first e
c
n
scenario, financial turmoil in China triggers a full-blown crisis that severely depresses U
&
activity in emerging market economies (EMEs). In the second scenario, weaker growth
s
k
abroad causes the dollar to appreciate substantially and oil prices to decline. In contrast, s

in the third scenario, recent strong job gains and upbeat consumer confidence signal that
economic activity is stronger than in the baseline; in addition, inflation is more sensitive
to tighter resource utilization. The fourth scenario considers a significantly lower
trajectory for the natural rate of unemployment and illustrates the consequences when
monetary policymakers learn about the lower natural rate only slowly. In the final
scenario, recent financial strains increase and economic activity falls sharply.
The first two scenarios are run in the multicountry SIGMA model, and the third
uses the Board staff’s EDO model. The fourth scenario uses a DSGE model developed
by Board staff economists that features search and matching frictions in the labor market.
The final scenario is implemented using a DSGE model developed by the staff from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York that explicitly incorporates financial frictions. In
each of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed—as in the baseline forecast— by
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1 In addition, all scenarios assume that the
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.
China-Driven Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies
In our baseline forecast, we expect reasonably solid Chinese real GDP growth of
6 percent or a little more, which helps allay concerns about a hard landing and contributes
to an eventual stabilization of the renminbi (see the box “Recent Developments in China
and Implications for the Outlook” in the International Economic Developments and
Outlook section). However, given China’s many underlying vulnerabilities—including
high corporate debt, excess capacity in manufacturing, continued property market
problems, and a large and opaque shadow banking system—a dverse shocks could trigger
a severe crisis that causes both China’s GDP growth and its currency to plummet, which
have large spillovers to other EMEs.
In this scenario, we assume that such a crisis materializes. GDP growth in China
plunges to around 1 percent this year before recovering, with the level of output falling
7 percent below the baseline by the middle of next year. GDP in other EMEs is
depressed to the same extent. The stresses in EMEs also trigger a noticeable rise in
y
corporate and household borrowing spreads in the United States and AFEs, while flight- n t

to-safety flows cause the dollar to appreciate 15 percent and depress term premiums on
government bonds. The EME GDP contraction in our scenario roughly parallels the
EME experience during the Asian and Russian crises of the late 1990s, while the rise in
the dollar is slightly larger than what occurred during the crises of the late 1990s. To
reflect the deeper linkages in global financial markets at present, we have built somewhat
larger disruptions to U.S. financial markets in this scenario than were observed in the late
1990s, at least prior to the Long-Term Capital Management crisis of September 1998.
In this environment, U.S. real net exports decline relative to the baseline in
response to the sharp decline in foreign activity and the substantial appreciation of the
dollar. Real GDP grows at an annual rate of about 1¼ percent in 2016, and the
unemployment rate rises to nearly 5¾ percent in 2017. The appreciation of the dollar and
lower resource utilization push down U.S. core PCE inflation to ½ percent in 2016. The
federal funds rate follows a much shallower path relative to the baseline.
Stronger Dollar and Lower Oil Prices
In our baseline projection, a modest pickup in foreign growth helps support
demand for crude oil and damps further upward pressure on the dollar so that oil prices
rise gradually and the dollar appreciates only slightly over the forecast period. These
developments are expected to help U.S. inflation move toward the Committee’s 2 percent
target by 2018. Nevertheless, even moderately weaker growth abroad may keep global
financial markets focused on downside risks to the foreign economies and monetary
policy divergence with the United States, causing the dollar to rise substantially and oil
prices to continue their descent. In this scenario, we assume that a shortfall in foreign
GDP growth of ½ percentage point per year relative to the baseline causes the dollar to
appreciate 10 percent—mainly by raising the risk premium on foreign currency–
denominated assets— and oil prices to decline 25 percent, about $7 per barrel, relative to
the baseline.
The stronger dollar and weaker activity abroad depress U.S. real net exports. As
this drag on net exports more than offsets the stimulus to consumption from lower oil
y
prices, U.S. real GDP expands only 2 percent in 2016, nearly ½ percentage point below n t

cause U.S. core inflation to fall to ¾ percent in 2016. The federal funds rate follows a
shallower path than in the baseline, reaching 2.5 percent by the end of 2018.
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation
Although many indicators of spending and production have recently been weak,
the labor market has been quite strong. Moreover, consumer confidence has remained
upbeat in recent months. In this scenario, we assume that these latter indicators are
providing a more accurate reading on the underlying state of the economy. In particular,
strong job gains and solid consumer confidence lead to faster consumer spending growth
that, in turn, spurs production and higher business investment. In addition, we assume
that inflation is more sensitive to resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO
model. This greater sensitivity is consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE
models, such as Smets and Wouters (2007).3 It is also consistent with the view that the
Phillips curve is steeper at higher rates of resource utilization than when economic
activity is relatively weak.4
Real GDP rises 3¾ percent in 2016, compared with 2½ percent in the baseline
projection. The unemployment rate falls rapidly, bottoming out at 4¼ percent by the end
of 2016; it then edges up over the remainder of the forecast period but stays lower than in
the baseline. With resource utilization running tighter and the Phillips curve assumed to
be steeper than in the standard version of the model, inflation rises more than in the
baseline, approaching 2½ percent, on average, in 2019 and 2020. The federal funds rate
rises more steeply, passing 4 percent in 2018 and reaching almost 5 percent in 2020.
Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the
unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to
2 percent. Unemployment does not need to exceed the natural rate to bring inflation back
down—simply returning to the natural rate is enough— because inflation expectations
remain anchored throughout the scenario.

Misperceived Natural Rate of Unemployment
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate falls to 4.6 percent
by the end of 2018, with the natural rate of unemployment unchanged at a 5.1 percent
level. This scenario considers the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment falls
1 percentage point over the next few years. The natural rate could be driven lower by a
variety of influences, such as demographic factors, improvements in matching efficiency,
or a deterioration in workers’ bargaining power.
The natural rate of unemployment is estimated with considerable uncertainty, and
it may be difficult for staff or policymakers to gauge such a change in the natural rate
accurately in real time. In this scenario, we assume that the FOMC learns about the
natural rate only gradually from noisy signals of the underlying economic drivers and,
thus, that a considerable gap between the actual and perceived natural rates persists
through the end of 2020. The unemployment rate falls to 4¼ percent by the end of 2018,
still slightly above the actual natural rate but considerably below the perceived natural
rate.
Economic activity is somewhat stronger than in the baseline throughout the
simulation as firms create more jobs and expand production. However, because the
unemployment rate does not fall as much as the true natural rate, there is disinflationary
pressure, and core inflation remains persistently below the baseline through the end of
2020. Despite the lower path for inflation in this scenario, the federal funds rate is only
slightly lower than in the baseline because of policymakers’ misperception of how much
resource slack is present in the economy.
Financial Turbulence
Measures of financial market volatility, such as the VIX, spiked up again recently
amid the unease in the stock market. Meanwhile, corporate bond spreads have continued
to climb since mid-2014 and have now reached levels similar to those at the onset of the
2001 recession. Market commentary has cited, among other contributing factors,
uncertainty about both the economic strength of the EMEs and U.S. corporate leverage.

roughly one-half the increase observed between 2007 and 2008.5 Spreads then gradually
return to a more normal level. The rise in spreads raises financing costs for firms’ capital
expenditures. In addition, the underlying increase in risk aversion depresses household
spending, further reducing aggregate demand.
Under these circumstances, the economy experiences an outright contraction in
the first quarter of 2016 and grows much more slowly than in the baseline for the rest of
the year. The unemployment rate rises to 5½ percent by the middle of the year before a
gradual recovery begins. Core PCE inflation is only slightly below the baseline because
the model has a fairly high degree of price rigidity. The path of the federal funds rate
remains roughly 1 percentage point below the baseline in 2017 and 2018.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that yy

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
