Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Since the June Tealbook, incoming information on economic activity has been D
n
close to our expectations on balance. On the positive side, the June labor market report o
c
E
was stronger than we had expected and corroborated our supposition that the May report
c
i
t
was anomalously weak. The news on consumer spending has been favorable as well. s
e
m
However, indicators of construction spending point to a weaker growth trajectory o
D
beginning in the second quarter; in addition, news from the industrial sector has come in
softer than our already modest expectations. Overall, we still estimate that real GDP
growth picked up from its lackluster pace in the first quarter to around 1¾ percent in the
second quarter.
Strikingly, the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) seems
to have had relatively mild effects on U.S. financial conditions and similarly mild
implications for our baseline outlook for real activity and inflation. We are anticipating
some small negative effects for the U.S. economy from a slightly higher value of the
dollar and lower foreign GDP, but these effects are essentially offset by somewhat lower
domestic borrowing rates and higher equity prices. We looked for adverse effects of
Brexit on uncertainty, but, as discussed in the Financial Developments section, the VIX
and interest rate spreads have more than retraced their spikes immediately following the
vote. The limited available survey evidence also suggests only small effects. Although
Brexit has not affected our baseline outlook much, it has somewhat increased our sense
of downside risks to real activity and inflation.
Based partly on the downbeat news on construction, we downgraded our
projection for GDP growth a little in the second half of this year to a 2 percent annual
rate; thereafter, real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 hews close to our previous forecast.
We expect GDP growth to increase to a 2½ percent pace next year and then to edge down
to around 2 percent in 2018—rates sufficient to generate some further tightening of
resource utilization. At the end of 2018, we project real GDP to be 1½ percent above our
estimate of its potential and the unemployment rate to be 4¼ percent, ¾ percentage point
below our estimate of its natural rate.
The inflation forecast is little revised relative to the one in the June Tealbook. We
continue to estimate that PCE prices rose at an annual rate of a little more than 1 percent

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
v
e The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is slightly weaker than the median
D
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip
n
o consensus forecast in 2016, but it is somewhat stronger than that of the Blue Chip in
c
E 2017. (The SPF forecast is released quarterly and is now two months old; we await
c
i the next release on August 12.) The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is
t
s
e slightly higher than the others in 2016 but about in line with Blue Chip in 2017. Staff
m
o projections for CPI inflation are similar to outside forecasters, though somewhat
D
lower than the SPF for both total and core PCE price inflation.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 We continue to set the federal funds rate path according to the version of the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we introduced in the June Tealbook.1 This rule
calls for the federal funds rate to increase roughly 90 basis points per year
over the projection period and to average 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of
2018. The assumed path of the federal funds rate is very similar to the one
from the June Tealbook.
 As in the June Tealbook, we assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at
its current level until the third quarter of next year and then begin to contract
as the proceeds from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 Treasury yields have come in well below our projection at the time of the June
Tealbook. The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to average only 1.7 percent
this quarter, 0.3 percentage point less than in the previous Tealbook, a
revision that, according to our preferred model, mostly reflects lower term
premiums. Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to
rise significantly over the medium term, reaching 3.3 percent by the end of
2018—only a handful of basis points lower than in the June Tealbook—as
term premiums increase gradually and the 10-year valuation window moves
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates.
1 The rule we introduced in June incorporated a downward adjustment to the intercept in the near
term that gradually fades over time such that the federal funds rate rises to a real long-run equilibrium rate
of 1 percent.

 Triple-B corporate bond spreads have, on net, edged down a little in recent
O
& weeks. As a result, we have revised our projection for triple-B corporate
l
e yields by a bit more than for 10-year Treasury yields. The path of 30-year
v
e
D fixed mortgage rates is revised down less than that of Treasury yields in the
n
o near term but by essentially the same amount as Treasury securities further

Equity Prices and Home Prices
o
D
 Equity prices are higher than we had projected at the time of the June
Tealbook. As a result, we have revised up the projected path for equity prices
about 2¾ percent. Stock prices are projected to increase a little less than
2 percent per year, on average, from late this year through 2018.
 CoreLogic has revised their methodology for constructing their flagship house
price index. Incorporating the new series and reestimating the coefficients of
the associated model of house price valuation, we now judge the current level
of prices to be only marginally above its historical relationship with rents and
noticeably less so than we earlier thought. Accordingly, we expect house
prices will decelerate less than in our previous forecast and project they will
rise at an average pace of about 4 percent per year in 2017 and 2018 (versus
3 percent in the June Tealbook).
Fiscal Policy
 We anticipate that discretionary fiscal actions across all levels of government
will provide a boost of 0.4 percentage point to real GDP growth this year and
next, with a smaller contribution in 2018. Relative to the June Tealbook, the
projected contribution is 0.1 percentage point lower this year, as purchases at
all levels of government have been rising at a somewhat more sluggish pace
than anticipated. (For a discussion pertaining to the outlook for the state and
local government sector, see the box “State and Local Pensions and Aggregate
Demand.”)
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Brexit-related uncertainty and financial stresses are expected to weigh on
economic growth in Europe, lowering our projection of foreign growth
¼ percentage point in the second half of this year and 0.1 percentage point

over the remainder of the forecast period. (For more details, see the box u t
O
“Global Implications of the U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union” in the
&
International Economic Developments and Outlook section.) Even with this e l
v
e
markdown, foreign growth is projected to rebound to an annual rate of D
n
2½ percent in the second half of this year from a 1½ percent pace in the o
c
E
second quarter, as some temporary factors restraining second-quarter growth
c
i
t
dissipate. Projected foreign growth then edges up further to 2¾ percent in s
e
m
2017 and 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policies and a o
D
recovery in Latin America.
 Despite the sizable post-referendum depreciation of the British pound, the
broad nominal dollar has appreciated only about 1½ percent since the time of
the June Tealbook. The dollar increased 3 percent against the currencies of
the advanced foreign economies and was up slightly against emerging market
currencies. We project the broad nominal dollar to appreciate at about a
1½ percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market expectations for
the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast. Relative to the June
Tealbook, our projection for the broad real dollar is about 1½ percent higher
by the end of 2018.
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has decreased about $5 per barrel since the
close of the June Tealbook, to $47 per barrel. This decline has been driven
primarily by concerns about unexpected increases in gasoline inventories.
Futures prices are down less—$1 per barrel—with the December 2018 Brent
futures price currently at $55 per barrel. The upward slope of the futures
curve is consistent with a reduction of the supply glut that has weighed on
prices since 2014.
 In contrast to oil prices and in spite of downward pressure from a slightly
stronger dollar, prices for industrial metals have risen on net since the June
Tealbook. Continued supply cuts and some improvement in demand have
supported metals prices. Agricultural prices, however, declined sharply since
mid-June on a more favorable U.S. weather forecast.

State and Local Pensions and Aggregate Demand
&
l
e
v
e Many state and local governments are confronting the legacy of years of pension
D
underfunding. This discussion explores the size of these unfunded liabilities and
n
o assesses their effect on the spending of state and local governments in recent years
c
E and in the future.
c
i
t
s
e States and localities estimate that unfunded pension liabilities totaled about $1 trillion
m
o in 2015. These liabilities are calculated using a discount rate based on the expected rate
D
of return on pension assets. However, finance theory suggests that future liabilities
should be discounted at rates that reflect the risk of the liabilities rather than the risk of
the assets. Using the lower discount rates associated with the pension liabilities makes
the funding situation look worse. For example, discounting by the Treasury yield curve
suggests that pension underfunding is closer to $3 trillion.1
Based on pension liabilities data that use an intermediate discount rate, the Federal
Reserve’s Enhanced Financial Accounts show that funding ratios—defined as the
market value of pension assets divided by the present value of liabilities—differ
significantly across states. In figure 1, states shown in white, such as Wisconsin, have
essentially fully funded pensions, while the dark red states, such as Illinois, have ratios
well under 50 percent.
Governments have been addressing pension underfunding by increasing their
contributions in recent years. Figure 2 displays estimates of annual pension
contributions as a percent of the actuarially defined employer contribution (ADEC).2
The ADEC has two components: the portion needed to fund the benefits earned by
workers in the current year and the portion needed to amortize unfunded liabilities
from previous years over a given period (usually 30 years). According to Census Bureau
data, between 2012 and 2015, state and local governments increased their total annual
contributions about $30 billion.3 Primarily because of this funding increase, the share
of the ADEC paid rose more than 9 percentage points to 91 percent in 2015.
Assuming these increased contributions would have otherwise been used on state and
local purchases, the increased pension funding has reduced the contribution of state
and local governments to real GDP by a relatively small cumulative total of 0.2 percent
over 2012 to 2015. Over the next several years, if states continue to increase their
1 See Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua Rauh (2011), “Public Pension Promises: How Big Are They and
What Are They Worth?” Journal of Finance, vol. 66 (August), pp. 1211–49. The estimate of pension
underfunding in this paper was subsequently updated; see Joshua Rauh (2015), “Unfunded Pension
Debts of U.S. States Still Exceed $3 Trillion,” Forbes, August 25.
2 The percentage of the ADEC paid, displayed in figure 2, is an estimate based on a sample of large
pension plans in Alicia H. Munnell and Jean-Pierre Aubry (2016), “The Funding of State and Local
Pensions: 2015–2020,” Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, Brief 50 (Boston: CRR,
June).

contributions at the same pace as in recent years, pensions would be roughly fully O
funded (by the ADEC criterion) by 2018, at the cost of a similar drag on aggregate &
l
demand. However, unlike in recent years, the adjustments would likely need to be e
v
e
more concentrated in the states with a legacy of pension underfunding, which would D
intensify the fiscal strain already being experienced by some of these governments. n
o
Indeed, pension woes were a major reason why Illinois was unable to pass a budget in c
E
fiscal year 2016 (which ended on June 30) and why Pennsylvania went nearly the entire c
i
t
year without a budget. s
e
m
o
The rise in state and local government purchases has been quite anemic over the D
course of the current expansion. Although the analysis here suggests that pension
obligations are likely a contributing factor, the magnitude of the pension effect is not
large enough to be the primary cause of the sluggish rise in purchases. That said, the
effect on aggregate demand could eventually be much larger. In particular, using the
lower discount rates discussed earlier, state and local governments are significantly
understating the annual contributions required to reach full funding. Nevertheless,
over the next few years, we view it as unlikely that these governments will shore up
their pensions beyond the contribution levels indicated by currently used discount
rates. Meeting the ADEC payment (calculated under current discount rates) is
generally viewed by these governments as being sufficient to “fully fund the pension
obligation.” Over the longer haul, though, these governments may be required to
increase their pension contributions more substantially.4
4 Many states have also increased the required contributions of new employees and reduced their
pension benefits. Some states have also attempted to reduce the benefits of current employees and
retirees. These benefits typically have legal protections, and attempts to reduce them are therefore
usually subject to legal challenges. Courts have expressed a wide range of views on pension reform,
with different states sometimes arriving at opposite conclusions. For example, reductions in cost-of-
living adjustments for current retirees were upheld in Colorado, Minnesota, New Jersey, and South
Dakota but were struck down in Arizona, Montana, and Illinois. Although the reduction in benefits
and increased employee contributions are unlikely to have a large effect on aggregate demand over
the next several years, the magnitude of the effect will likely increase gradually over time.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP u t
O
AND THE LABOR MARKET &
l
e
v
The data that have become available since the June Tealbook are consistent with a e
D
moderate pickup in real GDP growth to an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the second
n
o
quarter, essentially in line with our June forecast.2 For the second half of the year, our c
E
c
baseline view is that real activity will grow at a 2 percent rate—roughly ¼ percentage i
t
s
e
point less than in the June Tealbook—with a weaker path of residential investment m
o
making the largest contribution to this revision. D
 Incoming data point to a little more real PCE growth over the first half of the
year than we had estimated in the June Tealbook; we now put the average rate
of gain at about 2¾ percent, the same as in 2015. We expect real PCE to rise
at a 2½ percent pace in the second half of the year—unchanged from the June
Tealbook—supported by consumer sentiment that is still reasonably upbeat,
ongoing gains in employment and income, and past increases in household
wealth.
 In contrast, incoming data on residential construction suggest slower growth
over the near term than we had written down in the June Tealbook. Single-
family permits have been moving essentially sideways since late last year, and
revised data suggest a much larger decline in the average value of homes
started this past winter that will likely show through to falling real residential
investment over the second and third quarters of this year as those homes are
completed.3
 The near-term outlook for business investment remains weak, though we
expect some improvement relative to the experience of the past few quarters.
Investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is now estimated to have
declined at a 1¾ percent pace in the first half of the year, and available
indicators suggest a gain of 4½ percent in the current quarter, still modest by
2 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q2 Real GDP Growth,” the
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at
2.1 percent, is a touch higher than the staff’s judgmental projection.
3 That said, we also expect the annual NIPA revisions on July 29 to show an upward revision to
the level of residential investment in 2015, which mostly offsets the lower growth we now anticipate for
2016. That anticipated revision to 2015 is not currently reflected in the staff projection but would be
unlikely to alter our view of the resource utilization gap.

u t historical standards. (See the box “The Recent Weakness in Business
O
Investment and Corporate Profits.”) Meanwhile, investment in nonresidential
&
e l structures looks to have also declined in the first half of the year, but we
v
e
D expect activity to level off in the second half, with an end to the decline in
n
o drilling and mining structures an important part of the story.
c
E
c
t i  Incoming data now suggest that net exports had a neutral effect on GDP
s
e
m growth in the first half, as opposed to the small drag we had estimated in the
o
D
June Tealbook. However, we project that net exports will subtract about
½ percentage point from GDP growth in the second half of this year. Imports
have been surprisingly weak in recent quarters, but we expect import growth
to pick up in line with the stronger dollar and anticipated improvement in U.S.
consumption and investment. We expect that exports will continue to be held
down by a high dollar and weak foreign demand.
 Manufacturing production was little changed, on balance, in May and June
and has been essentially flat for the past year and a half. Factory output has
been held down by weak foreign demand and the strong dollar, along with
slow capital investment and spillovers from the drop in mining output.
Although regional and national new orders indexes have moved up, on net,
in recent months, they point to only modest growth in the second half of
the year.
Turning to the near-term labor data, the June employment report corroborated our
earlier view that the readings from the May report were anomalously weak and that the
labor market has continued to improve. Nevertheless, data in hand suggest that the pace
of labor market improvement has slowed this year.
 Nonfarm payroll employment is currently reported to have increased 287,000
in June following a gain of only 11,000 in May. Although we had expected
payrolls to bounce back last month, the estimated job gain in June was some
100,000 stronger than we had projected.4 On average, payrolls increased
4 According to the BLS, payrolls in May were held down about 35,000 because workers were on
strike at Verizon; these workers were back on the job as of the June survey week, which boosted the June
payroll gain by the same amount. These strike-related dynamics were known at the time of the June
Tealbook and do not account for our surprise in either May or June.

 The unemployment rate rebounded to 4.9 percent in June from 4.7 percent in t i
s
e
May and, on net, is down just slightly so far this year. The labor force m
o
D
participation rate also ticked up in June and has changed little, on net, over the
past year—which, when judged against its declining trend, implies some
improvement in this dimension of labor market conditions. We expect both
the participation rate and the unemployment rate to hold at their June levels
through the current quarter, consistent with some additional narrowing of
labor market slack.
 The share of employees working part time for economic reasons, which has
been little changed, on balance, since late last year after falling notably in the
previous year, is still somewhat elevated relative to its pre-recession level and
we think is consistent with an additional small source of remaining slack.
 The labor market conditions index (LMCI) moved down in June for the sixth
consecutive month. Taken at face value, the LMCI thus points to some
deterioration in labor market conditions in the first half of this year, which
contrasts with the staff’s assessment that labor market conditions have
continued to improve.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND THE LABOR MARKET
Overall, the available information suggests that the cyclical position of the
economy continued to improve in recent quarters but at a slower pace than previously.
This apparent slowing raises the key questions as to why it happened and what it portends
for the future. The slowing might be seen as particularly concerning, given that the
5 Our estimate of the neutral pace of payroll gain is necessarily imprecise; it is meant to represent
the amount that, on average, would be sufficient to hold the unemployment rate flat, allow the labor force
participation rate to decline in line with its estimated structural trend, and yield a wedge between the
household and payroll measures of employment approximately consistent with the cycle’s being in a
mature phase. Historically, the relationship between employment in the household survey and employment
in the payroll survey has been loose.

The Recent Weakness in Business Investment and Corporate Profits
&
l
e
v
e Nonresidential private fixed investment has been quite disappointing of late. The
D
weakness is apparent even for equipment and intangibles (E&I) investment, which has
n
o been much less affected than energy-sector structures by the fall in energy prices.
c
E Although the recent softness in business investment might be partly due to noise or
c
i mismeasurement, it may also reflect firms’ recent profit performance and expectations
t
s
e that their future profits will not rise enough to justify a faster pace of capital spending
m
o today. In light of notably dour analysts’ profit expectations, our outlook for E&I
D
investment is especially weak this year.
Real E&I investment is estimated to have declined at an average annual rate of
2½ percent in 2015:Q4 and 2016:Q1, and the incoming data suggest that investment was
little changed in the second quarter. E&I investment has been much weaker than we
anticipated in the October 2015 Tealbook, immediately prior to when we began receiving
spending data for the fourth quarter (figure 1). Although we expect E&I spending to pick
up in the second half of the year, we still project spending to rise by less than 1 percent
for 2016 as a whole, which is unusual for an expansion.
NIPA corporate profits have also moved down on net lately, and in the first quarter they
were more than 4 percent below their level from a year earlier (the green line in figure 2).
As a result, the return on existing capital—a measure of the profitability of firms’
installed capital—has declined, even if from an elevated level (the blue line in figure 2). If
the decline in profits was seen as merely temporary, we would not expect it to have
much effect on capital spending. However, Wall Street analysts now expect profits to be
essentially flat this year (not shown), which is a significant downgrade from earlier
perceptions. Although a large portion of the recent weakness in corporate profits and
profit expectations is concentrated in the energy sector, other sectors have also seen
significant downgrades, with S&P 500 (excluding energy) profits expected to grow only
modestly in 2016. Moreover, expectations of profits three to five years ahead—as
reported by analysts who follow S&P 500 firms—have also been downgraded

substantially since early last year even after accounting for the downward trend since the O
mid-2000s (figure 3). &
l
e
v
e
Figure 4 shows E&I investment growth and predictions from the staff’s workhorse D
medium-term forecasting model.1 In this model, investment is explained by business n
o
output growth and the cost of capital, which are intended to proxy for firms’ expected c
E
future profits. Although the increase in E&I investment in recent years has fallen short of c
i
t
longer-term historical averages, it has been reasonably well explained by this model, s
e
which captures the subdued pace of the overall recovery through the business output m
o
term. That said, investment in recent quarters has been noticeably below the predictions D
of the model, and we expect that to hold for the year as a whole. Some of the surprising
weakness in E&I investment may reflect low demand for mining equipment; some of it
may also simply be noise, given the inherent volatility of business investment.
In addition, some of the recent weakness in E&I investment may reflect the drop in actual
profits or expectations of future profits. Indeed, taking account of analysts’ expectations
of future profits, such as those shown in figure 3, does appear to improve the model
forecasts.2 As shown by the red line in figure 4, the projections from this model imply a
softer pace of real E&I growth this year that is more in line with the recent data and
consistent with the current Tealbook projection. We also investigated whether adding
realized NIPA corporate profits to the model improved its performance but found that it
did not, perhaps because the explanatory power of that variable was already captured in
the other variables included in the model.
1 The staff’s model is based on the neoclassical investment model, which tends to outperform other
models in the macrodata. See Stephen Oliner, Glenn Rudebusch, and Daniel Sichel (1995), “New and Old
Models of Business Investment: A Comparison of Forecasting Performance,” Journal of Money, Credit,
and Banking, vol. 27 (August), pp. 806–26.
2 For evidence on using analysts’ profit expectations to help predict business investment, see Jason
Cummins, Kevin Hassett, and Stephen Oliner (2006), “Investment Behavior, Observable Expectations,
and Internal Funds,” American Economic Review, vol. 96 (June), pp. 796–810. In addition to these data,
we also use many other indicators, such as measures of business sentiment and uncertainty, and bond
spreads.

u t settings of the FOMC’s main policy instruments have remained close to unchanged (with
O
the federal funds rate up only 25 basis points and the SOMA portfolio still very large).
&
e l As for why it happened, one factor may have been the appreciation of the dollar since
v
e
D mid-2014 and the circumstances that gave rise to that appreciation, including the
n
o weakness in foreign growth. Other factors include the recent weakness in business fixed
c
E
investment and a reduction in stockbuilding from the rapid pace of a year ago.
c
i
t
s
e
m
Looking ahead, we project GDP growth to step up to 2½ percent in 2017,
o
D
reflecting in part a waning drag from the dollar appreciation since mid-2014 as well as a
step-up in business investment. This outlook is predicated on the view that—among
other things—Brexit will not lead to the breakup of the euro area or other severe
consequences. In 2018, GDP growth falls back to 2 percent as monetary policy gradually
normalizes and the stimulus from fiscal policy diminishes.
 The pace of GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 is very similar to our June
Tealbook projection. Lower interest rates and higher household wealth
provide small boosts to the forecast, whereas the weaker foreign outlook and
stronger dollar mostly offset those effects.
 With GDP growth expected to outpace our estimate of potential growth over
the medium term, real activity overshoots our estimate of its long-run
equilibrium level. At the end of 2018, we forecast real GDP to be 1½ percent
above potential—about the same as in the June Tealbook.
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed, the outlook for the
labor market is similar to our June projection.
 The contour of total job gains over the medium term roughly follows that of
GDP growth, with average monthly increases slowing from 185,000 next year
to 145,000 in 2018.
 These job gains are sufficient to cause the unemployment rate to fall to
4.3 percent at the end of 2018, 0.7 percentage point below our estimate of its
natural rate and unrevised from our June projection.
 The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend next year
and in 2018, as sustained job gains and rising wages continue to draw

individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows. As a result, the u t

 Labor productivity is forecast to increase 0.7 percent in 2016, the same as last E

o
D
 We made no changes to our supply-side assumptions this round.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Price data received since the close of the June Tealbook have been close to our
expectations. With the June PPI and CPI data now in hand, we estimate headline PCE
price inflation to have moved up to an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the second quarter,
led by a substantial rebound in gasoline prices. In contrast, core PCE inflation has
slowed modestly in recent months following a 2.0 percent reading in the first quarter of
the year. We project the 12-month changes in headline and core PCE prices to remain in
the neighborhood of 1 percent and 1½ percent, respectively, through late this year.
 Core PCE price inflation is projected to slow from a 1.9 percent annual rate in
the first half of the year to a 1.3 percent pace in the second half. The slowing
reflects some residual seasonality as well as expected decelerations in prices
for goods and nonmarket services following outsized gains early in the year.6
 PCE energy prices rebounded in the second quarter following sharp declines
in the first quarter and late last year. With oil prices having moved down
since the June Tealbook, PCE energy prices are now expected to be little
changed, on balance, over the remainder of the year.
 PCE food prices declined at an estimated 1¾ percent annual rate in the first
half of the year; the weakness in this category has been more sustained than
6 For example, nonmarket services prices, a category from which we take little signal for future
price changes and where we see little seasonal pattern, are estimated to have risen at a 3½ percent pace in
the first half of this year compared with a 2½ percent increase in 2015. Similarly, some categories of goods
showed large increases earlier this year that we expect to be transitory, such as an outsized jump in jewelry
prices.

we expected in the June Tealbook. With food commodity prices having u t
O
moved down recently, we expect consumer food prices to continue to run
&
somewhat below core inflation, on average, over the second half of the year. e l
v
e
D
 After having declined over the previous six quarters, core import prices are n
o
c
estimated to have risen at a 1 percent annual rate in the second quarter. We E
c
project these prices to continue rising moderately through the rest of the t i
s
e
forecast period, reflecting the influences of foreign price increases tempered m
o
D
by the small further dollar appreciation in our projection.
 On balance, readings on longer-term inflation expectations appear consistent
with the view that these expectations remain reasonably stable. The Michigan
survey now shows longer-term inflation expectations having been 2.6 percent
in June. (The preliminary reading for June, published between the close of the
June Tealbook and the FOMC meeting, had dipped to a record-low
2.3 percent.) The preliminary estimate for July held steady at 2.6 percent.
Three-year-ahead expected inflation from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations rose to 2.9 percent in June, roughly
similar to its level of a year ago. The TIPS-based measure of five-year-
forward inflation compensation is 1.4 percent, 0.1 percentage point below its
value at the time of the June Tealbook.
Our outlook for inflation beyond the near term is essentially unrevised. We
continue to project that core PCE inflation will move up to 1.8 percent by 2018, primarily
reflecting the waning restraint from earlier declines in energy and import prices. With
consumer food and energy prices expected to rise roughly in line with core prices after
this year, we project that total PCE prices will rise at essentially the same pace as core
PCE prices.
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our core inflation projection has been
revised up slightly in 2016 and down slightly in 2017 and 2018.
We have received little information on hourly compensation since the June
FOMC meeting, and our projection is little changed: We continue to project that
business-sector hourly compensation will increase at about a 3 percent pace over the
medium term.

E Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is more procyclical than average hourly
c
t i earnings, has moved up a bit more in the past year and a half, from around
s
e
m
2¾ percent to 3½ percent, but the pace of gains remains well below its pre-
o
D
recession levels.7
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 The natural rate of unemployment remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP
increases at about its long-run value of 1.9 percent per year starting in 2020.
 With the economy running above its potential and inflation close to the
Committee’s 2 percent objective, the federal funds rate rises above its long-
run value in 2019. It reaches 3.6 percent in 2021 before moving back toward
its long-run value of 3 percent.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by 2022.
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates further and
rises at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2021. The unemployment
rate remains at 4.3 percent in 2019 and then rises gradually toward its
assumed natural rate in subsequent years.
 PCE price inflation moves up from 1.8 percent in 2018 to the Committee’s
long-run objective by 2020.
7 The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker is calculated using microdata from the Current
Population Survey. It is the 3-month moving average of the median 12-month change in the hourly wage
for all individuals who are employed both in the current month and in the same month one year earlier
(though not necessarily at all times between those two dates nor at the same employer).

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The key development influencing our international forecast over the intermeeting
period was the unexpected “leave” outcome of the June 23 U.K. referendum on
membership in the European Union (EU). The vote for British EU exit, also known as
“Brexit,” has increased economic and political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, which
we expect to substantially lower the rate of U.K. economic growth over the next year and
a half. The vote also has heightened euro-area political risks and amplified existing
vulnerabilities in its banking system, likely weighing on euro-area growth. Beyond
k
Europe, however, the effects of Brexit are expected to be limited, as many post-vote asset o
o
l
t
price declines have been reversed. Thus, we have lowered our forecast for aggregate u
O
foreign growth only ¼ percentage point in the second half and just a touch in 2017 and &
l
2018 (see the box “Global Implications of the U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union”). e
v
e
D
n
The Brexit shock comes against the backdrop of a foreign expansion that was not
o
c
very solidly entrenched. We had anticipated a slowing of growth in the second quarter, E
l
’
t
mainly due to temporary factors such as wildfires in Canada, and we have marked down n
I
our estimate a bit further, to 1½ percent, based on recent weak data, especially from
Canada and Mexico. Still, we expect aggregate foreign growth will rise to 2½ percent in
the second half, as rebounds in Canada and Latin America more than offset a slowing in
Europe. The effects of Brexit only slow somewhat, but do not stop, the recovery of
foreign growth, which rises to its trend pace of 2¾ percent in the next two years, as
projected in the June Tealbook.
In our projection, foreign growth is supported by more accommodative monetary
policy. We now assume policy easing by the Bank of England (BOE) and the European
Central Bank (ECB), and we have increased the extent of policy easing assumed for the
Bank of Japan (BOJ). In addition, the central banks of Indonesia and Taiwan cut their
policy rates during the intermeeting period in response to concerns over slowing external
demand. Most recently, on July 19, Turkey’s central bank cut its marginal funding rate;
this fifth consecutive monthly cut in rates was expected even before the previous
weekend’s coup attempt.
Although the Brexit vote had a limited net effect on financial markets outside
Europe and we expect only modest effects on overall foreign activity, Brexit does
intensify some downside risks to the outlook. Contentious negotiations between U.K.

Global Implications of the U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union
On June 23, a slim majority of U.K. voters elected to leave the European Union (EU). Although
the referendum result is not legally binding, new Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to proceed
with British withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”). This discussion lays out our assumptions
regarding Brexit and the implications for the United Kingdom, Europe, and the rest of the world.
Prime Minister May indicated that the U.K. government will probably wait at least until around
year-end before triggering Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union, which governs the
withdrawal process from the EU. We assume negotiations between U.K. and EU authorities will
be complex, as the U.K. government will demand some restrictions on EU immigration but, at the
same time, will try to preserve the current U.K. access to the EU single market. Even so, in our
k
o baseline, we assume a new deal will be reached (or largely decided) in the two-year period
o
t l prescribed by Article 50. Most probably, the new relationship will include a preferential trade
u
O agreement but with some restrictions on access to the single market, including for financial
&
services. Based on a literature review of the costs of leaving the EU, we estimate that Brexit will
l
e lower the level of U.K. GDP 5 percent in the long run.1 This admittedly very uncertain estimate
v
e
D reflects direct losses due to less trade integration as well as some negative spillovers on U.K.
n productivity growth.
o
c
E
Higher economic and political uncertainty are also likely to restrain economic activity in the
l
’
n t United Kingdom in the short and medium run. As shown by the red line in figure 1, the Economic
I
Policy Uncertainty index increased noticeably in the months leading to the Brexit referendum and
stayed at an elevated level following the vote to leave the EU.2 This rise in uncertainty and the
associated surge in financial stress (the red line in figure 2) are expected to weigh on U.K.
investment and consumption. We revised our forecast for the level of U.K. GDP down 2 percent
by the end of 2018, largely based on our empirical analysis relating measures of uncertainty and
financial stresses to economic conditions in the U.K. economy.
So far, Brexit spillovers to other economies have been felt primarily in the euro area, as shown by
the rise in measures of uncertainty and financial stress (the blue lines in figures 1 and 2). The
increase in financial stress is mainly due to overall stock return volatility as well as falling stock
prices and rising credit default swap spreads of euro-area banks. Euro-area banks have been
under stress for a while amid growing concerns over bank profitability, capital adequacy, and the
sufficiency of euro-area financial backstops (further discussed in the box “Taking Stock of
European Banks after Brexit” in the Financial Developments section). Some banking sectors with
large exposure to the nonbank U.K. private sector, notably those of Ireland and Spain, could
suffer if the United Kingdom were to experience a significant downturn. Overall, largely based on
increased uncertainty and financial stresses, we revised the level of GDP in the euro area down
¾ percent by the end of 2018.
1 The U.K. treasury estimates that Brexit will reduce the level of U.K. GDP in 2030 between 3 and 9.5 percent,
depending on whether the country remains in the European Economic Area or reaches no preferential agreement
with the EU, in which case U.K.–EU trade will be governed by World Trade Organization rules.

Given the relatively subdued reaction of global financial markets to Brexit once the initial surprise
had passed, other parts of the world are affected only marginally by Brexit under our baseline
forecast. Some advanced economies, including the United States and Japan, experienced sharp
declines in stock prices and strengthening of their currencies in the first days after the
referendum, but these movements were, to a large extent, subsequently reversed. In the
emerging market economies, given their small trade exposure to Europe and limited financial
spillovers to date (perhaps due to prospects of easier monetary policy in the advanced
economies), economic activity should not be much affected.
Of course, it is still early, and more substantial adverse consequences from Brexit could still
materialize from several sources. First, the prospect of further financial disruptions in the United
Kingdom remains. For example, recent stresses in U.K. commercial real estate (CRE) funds could
k
lead to a wider downturn in the U.K. real estate market, curtail lending by small businesses that o
o
predominantly use CRE as collateral, and spill over to other financial markets both in the United l
t
u
Kingdom and perhaps abroad. Second, banking sectors in the peripheral euro-area countries, O
especially in Italy, could come under such pressure as to reduce government fiscal positions and &
the availability of regional financial backstops, thus reviving the euro-area crisis. Third, the U.K. e l
v
referendum could spur a rise of populist parties and anti-EU movements in various EU countries e
D
that could lead people to worry about a breakup of the EU, also heightening financial stresses.
n
The global implications of such risks materializing would be significant, as discussed in the Risks o
c
E
and Uncertainty section.
l
’
t
n
Although downside risks predominate, we cannot exclude the possibility of more benign I
scenarios than in the baseline. First, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU could
be productive and quick, leading the short-run economic effects for both the United Kingdom
and the rest of Europe to be limited. Second, it is also possible that Brexit will not happen,
perhaps because the U.K. Parliament takes actions to stop the Brexit process. In such a case, we
may still see some short-run costs as a result of elevated political uncertainty, but many adverse
effects of Brexit over the longer term would be avoided.

and European authorities and a further rise in support for anti-EU movements in other
member countries could fuel worries about a breakup of the EU. Moreover, concerns
have risen about the health of European banks, especially in Italy (see the box “Taking
Stock of European Banks after Brexit” in the Financial Developments section). These
concerns could contribute to a loss of confidence in fiscal positions and financial
backstops for vulnerable euro-area countries and, at an extreme, lead to a revival of the
euro-area crisis (see the alternative scenario “Severe Financial Stress in Europe” in the
Risks and Uncertainty section). Other risks to the global economy also remain a source
of concern, including the possibility of a hard landing in China resulting from mounting
k financial vulnerabilities and the risk of negative spillovers to emerging market economies
o
o
l (EMEs) from monetary policy normalization by the Federal Reserve.
t
u
O
&
Inflation is anticipated to remain below the 2 percent targets in both the euro area
l
e
v and Japan throughout the forecast period. We marked down projected inflation in those
e
D
economies in response to weaker economic growth and, in the case of Japan, a stronger
n
o
c yen. In contrast, we are projecting a temporary surge in U.K. inflation on account of the
E
’ l recent sharp depreciation of the pound. Inflation in the EMEs declined to 2¾ percent in
t
n
I the second quarter, largely on a sharp slowing in food price inflation, but it is projected to
rise to 3¼ percent for the remainder of the forecast period.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• United Kingdom. We estimate that real GDP expanded 1¾ percent in the
second quarter, the same as in the previous quarter and higher than we had
anticipated, as indicators of activity before the Brexit referendum showed
more momentum than previously assumed. However, we expect increased
political and economic uncertainty will depress business investment and
consumer spending following the U.K. vote to leave the EU. The substantial
depreciation of the pound and a more accommodative monetary policy stance
are expected to provide only a partial offset. Accordingly, we project that
GDP growth will step down to less than 1 percent in the second half of this
year before rising back to 1¾ percent pace by 2018. Compared with the June
Tealbook, this forecast has been marked down 1½ percentage points in the
second half of this year, 1 percentage point in 2017, and ½ percentage point
in 2018.
Page 40 of 98

--- Page 44 ---

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2016
The recent pound depreciation is projected to push U.K. inflation up to
2½ percent by early next year. However, we assume the BOE, as it has
indicated in recent communications, will look through that temporary surge in
inflation and ease monetary policy in response to the considerable
deterioration in the outlook. We assume the BOE will cut its policy rate
25 basis points, to 0.25 percent, and announce additional asset purchases
(perhaps including private-sector assets) of £75 billion; the BOE currently
holds the £375 billion in assets that it purchased between 2009 and 2012.
• Euro Area. Recent indicators, including industrial production data through
k
o
May, suggest GDP growth declined from 2.2 percent in the first quarter to o
l
t
1¼ percent in the second. In the aftermath of the U.K. referendum, we u
O
anticipate euro-area economic growth will be depressed by stresses on euro- &
l
e
area financial institutions and by uncertainty over euro-area cohesion and v
e
D
negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom. Thus, we revised
n
down our growth projection relative to the June Tealbook ½ percentage point o
c
E
in the second half of this year and ¼ percentage point next year. We now l
’
t
n
project GDP growth to slow to about 1 percent in the second half before rising I
to 1¾ percent by 2018. With inflation projected to rise from its current near-
zero pace to only 1½ percent by the end of 2018, we assume the ECB will
announce additional stimulus at its September meeting by lowering its deposit
rate 10 basis points (to negative 0.5 percent) and committing to purchase
assets at the current pace for one additional quarter, until mid-2017.
• Japan. We estimate that GDP growth slowed from 1.9 percent in the first
quarter to ½ percent in the second. The second-quarter estimate is
1 percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook, as recent data, including
a rebound in the manufacturing PMI in June, suggest the economic effect of
April’s earthquakes was less severe than previously assessed. Moving
forward, we expect Japan’s economy to expand at a pace near ¾ percent
through 2018, a bit lower than in the previous Tealbook because of the
appreciation of the yen. Our forecast for the June Tealbook already assumed
the new stimulus package that Prime Minister Shinzō Abe is set to pursue
following his party’s sizable election victory on July 10. In addition, amid
weak growth prospects and with inflation projected to rise only to 1 percent
by the end of 2018, we expect the BOJ to ease monetary policy at its July

--- Page 45 ---

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2016
meeting by cutting its deposit rate 15 basis points (to negative 0.25 percent)
and increasing purchases of exchange-traded stock funds and Japanese
government bonds.
• Canada. Disruptions in oil production following wildfires in Alberta weighed
on the Canadian economy in the second quarter. In addition, data on April
monthly GDP, May international trade, and June manufacturing PMI point to
weaker-than-expected activity even outside the energy sector. As such, we
revised down our estimate of Canadian GDP growth 1 percentage point to a
contraction of 1 percent in the second quarter. However, we anticipate a
k
o
o strong payback in the second half of the year as oil production recovers, and
l
t
u
O we project GDP growth to average almost 2¾ percent through mid-2017,
& supported by a weak Canadian dollar and accommodative monetary and fiscal
l
e
v policies. This projection is slightly weaker than in the June Tealbook, largely
e
D
reflecting a more subdued outlook for business investment.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
’
t
n
I
• China. Real GDP growth rose from an upwardly revised 6.5 percent in the
first quarter to 7.1 percent last quarter, ½ percentage point above our June
Tealbook estimate. Growth was boosted by a partial recovery of exports and a
credit-induced acceleration in investment by state-owned enterprises, which
more than offset a slowing in the growth of private investment. We expect
GDP growth to decline going forward as the authorities, concerned about
aggravating financial vulnerabilities, temper their stimulus. Indeed, in our
view, further increases in corporate indebtedness in recent quarters pose
significant downside risks. That said, the steady depreciation of the renminbi
on a trade-weighted basis (by more than 10 percent since last August) also
presents some upside risk to growth in the coming quarters. For now,
however, we see growth falling to about 6½ percent in the second half of this
year and to about 5¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, in line with our
estimate of potential growth.
• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP growth picked up in the
second quarter to 3½ percent after subdued first-quarter growth of 2.6 percent.
However, recent data, especially exports, were a bit weaker than expected,
Page 42 of 98

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2016
and we have nudged down our near-term growth forecast. Concerns that
weak external demand will spill over into domestic demand have already led
to monetary policy easing in Indonesia and Taiwan and to a new fiscal
stimulus program in Korea. We assess the negative effects of Brexit on
growth to be small, given the relatively limited trade exposures of these
countries to Europe and the fairly benign financial market spillovers observed
so far. We continue to project growth to strengthen to 3¾ percent in 2017,
supported by accommodative policies and a recovery in exports.
• Mexico. Recent data on exports, industrial production, and domestic spending
k
o
were weaker than expected, and we now see a sharper slowing in GDP o
l
t
growth, to 2 percent in the second quarter from 3.3 percent in the first. We u
O
expect growth to gradually climb up to 2¾ percent by mid-2017, supported by &
l
e
the 20 percent real depreciation of the peso since mid-2014, the boost to v
e
D
disposable income from reform-related price reductions in
n
telecommunications, and energy reform. Those factors should outweigh the o
c
E
negative growth effects of a gradual rise in the Bank of Mexico’s policy rate, l
’
t
n
which is expected to track the federal funds rate upward. On June 30, the I
Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate 50 basis points, to 4.25 percent, largely
in response to concerns that earlier peso depreciation would boost inflation.
Mexican inflation is projected to rise from a 2½ percent pace in the first half
of this year to just above the 3 percent target in the second half.
• Brazil. We estimate that the recession deepened in the second quarter, with
GDP contracting 3 percent at an annual rate, as slowing export growth and
falling retail sales signaled weak external and domestic demand. We expect
GDP growth to turn positive next year and to rise to only 2 percent by 2018.
Consumer and business confidence measures recently have improved, and
industrial production has leveled off after a long decline. Political uncertainty
remains a drag on growth, although the government has succeeded in
negotiating limits on states’ spending and has submitted a constitutional
amendment bill to the National Congress to tie public spending growth to
inflation. We project that inflation will fall from an estimated 7½ percent
pace in the second quarter to 5½ percent by mid-2017, allowing a modest
reduction in policy rates.

Financial Developments
Negative sentiment surrounding the outcome of the U.K. referendum on exit from
the European Union (“Brexit”) early in the intermeeting period was subsequently
alleviated by expectations for greater policy accommodation in the AFEs, the reduction
of near-term political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and positive domestic
economic data releases. Immediately after the vote, prices of risky assets declined
sharply while the prices of safe-haven assets spiked. Despite substantial volatility in
financial markets, there were minimal disruptions to market functioning. Longer-term
nominal Treasury yields decreased further in the two weeks following the vote.
Since then, Treasury yields have reversed some of their post-Brexit decline
.
Prices of most risky assets have more than rebounded from the nadir reached during the
week following the Brexit vote, reflecting in part expectations for policy support abroad
as well as better-than-anticipated employment and retail sales releases that apparently
helped ease concerns about the U.S. economic outlook.
 The path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes was little changed,
on net, over the intermeeting period. However, the median dealer’s modal
policy path of the target federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018 from the Survey s

Yield spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed slightly, and
those on speculative-grade corporate bonds fell notably.

 The broad U.S. dollar index was little changed on net; it strengthened against
most AFE currencies—especially the British pound—but weakened against
most EME currencies.
 Overall, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained
accommodative, and firms have continued to raise funds through debt markets
in recent weeks.
 Conditions in the residential mortgage market became somewhat more
accommodative as mortgage rates fell modestly and a number of large banks
reported easing their standards on GSE-eligible home-purchase loans in the
July 2016 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
(SLOOS).
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Initial Market Reaction to the United Kingdom’s Brexit Vote
In the days immediately following the Brexit vote, asset prices were volatile, and
some markets, particularly certain FX markets, experienced brief periods of strained
liquidity. Global stock indexes sold off notably, credit spreads widened, and safe-haven
assets appreciated substantially. Nonetheless, these moves were consistent with—or, in
s
many cases, smaller than—what had been expected by many market participants in the n t
e
event of a “leave” vote. Moreover, there were no broad-based market dislocations, m
p
o
apparently because major investors and financial market utilities had prepared l
e
v
sufficiently for a volatile scenario. Market participants also pointed to the e
D
communications and actions by advanced-economy central banks both before and after a l
i
c
the vote as helping to reassure investors. Nevertheless, several longer-term Brexit-related n
a
n
risks remain, including to financial stability and political cohesion in the European i
F
Union.
Foreign Developments
In the weeks following the Brexit vote, risk sentiment improved substantially on
the back of the resolution of some of the near-term political uncertainty in the United
Kingdom, as well as the better-than-expected U.S. June employment and retail sales
releases. Longer-term sovereign yields in Germany and Japan are down slightly since the
June FOMC meeting, and U.K. yields fell more strongly on expectations for further
policy accommodation. Peripheral euro-area spreads narrowed, in part, as the ECB

reportedly shifted its asset purchase program toward peripheral bonds, though some of
the decline in Spanish spreads also reflected improved sentiment following the poor
showing of the far-left Podemos party in general elections.
The broad U.S. dollar was little changed, on net, since the June FOMC meeting.
The British pound partially recovered from its post-Brexit lows but remains weaker
against all major currencies over the intermeeting period, including by 7½ percent against
the U.S. dollar. Similarly, the yen retraced most of its post-Brexit gains amid
improvements in risk sentiment and expectations of more stimulus by the Bank of Japan.
In addition, following the Japanese parliamentary elections in which Prime Minister
Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party strengthened its majority, the government announced
further fiscal stimulus. Emerging market assets were relatively resilient over the
intermeeting period, as the dollar weakened against most emerging market currencies,
and flows into emerging market assets picked up. By contrast, the Chinese renminbi
depreciated against the U.S. dollar and the currency basket, but this development elicited
little market reaction. Later in the intermeeting period, the unsuccessful coup attempt in
Turkey left little imprint on other emerging market assets.
Improved risk sentiment and increased expectations for additional policy stimulus
in Europe and Japan led global equity indexes higher, on net, over the intermeeting
period. Stocks of larger U.K. companies with significant overseas operations benefited s
t
n
from the weaker pound, far outperforming smaller domestic-oriented peers. European e
m
p
bank equity indexes underperformed on investor fears that lower yields will continue to o
l
e
weigh on profitability. Italian bank stocks, in particular, continued to come under v

significant selling pressure due to ongoing concerns about loan quality and exacerbated

a
apprehensions about slower growth and lower rates. Investors will be focused on the c i
n
a
results of the euro-area bank stress tests (see the box “Taking Stock of European Banks n

Domestic Developments
Since the June FOMC meeting, the policy path implied by OIS quotes was little
changed on net. The OIS curve remains very flat, with futures quotes not fully pricing in
a quarter-point tightening until early 2018. However, these quotes are likely depressed
somewhat by negative term premiums. The implied policy path declined somewhat after
the June Summary of Economic Projections showed larger-than-expected downward
revisions to the projected path of the federal funds rate. Following the Brexit vote, the

Taking Stock of European Banks after Brexit
In the wake of the U.K. vote to exit the European Union (EU), EU bank equities have been
hard hit, with bank stocks declining up to 30 percent in the immediate aftermath and
remaining depressed on balance despite a broad recovery in equity prices (as shown in
the figure on the following page).1 The declines—with weaker institutions being more
significantly affected—appear to reflect concerns about the effects on bank profits of
lower expected EU growth, further monetary easing, and a flatter yield curve. To date,
for most European banks, solvency concerns appear limited: CDS spreads have increased
but remain well below levels observed during the European sovereign debt crisis for
most banks. However, the release of the EU bank stress‐test results on July 29 has the
potential to reveal new weaknesses and intensify such fears.
For U.K. banks, stocks fell after the vote, but the severity differed notably across
institutions. Declines were the largest for the banks with significant domestic operations,
likely reflecting expectations for deterioration in the U.K. economic outlook and asset
quality, especially for commercial real estate. In contrast, stocks for Asia‐oriented banks
were less affected and have risen on balance. To help prevent liquidity problems and
cushion the possible effect of credit intermediation, the Bank of England has made
additional liquidity available through sterling funding auctions and reduced the
countercyclical capital buffer rate from 0.5 percent to 0 percent.
Investment bank share prices across the EU also saw declines, as markets anticipated
weaker investment banking revenues and an increase in operational and regulatory costs
s from the possible loss of “passporting rights,” which allow these banks to operate
t
n
e through branches or provide cross‐border services across the EU. Reactions of share
m
prices of other banks in the euro‐area core have also been sizable and mostly driven by
p
o dimmer earnings prospects.
l
e
v
e
D The shares of banks in the euro‐area periphery saw particularly steep declines. Although
l
a these banks have little direct exposure to the United Kingdom, they tend to have very
i
c
n low earnings and capital buffers, and they operate in the weakest economies. Italian
a
n banks, in particular, have suffered. Unlike banks in other peripheral countries, Italian
i
F
banks did not undergo major government‐sponsored restructuring after the European
sovereign debt crisis. As a result, they have a very high share of nonperforming loans
(NPLs) (18 percent of gross loans), insufficient provisions against losses on these loans
(45 percent of NPLs), and low profitability (return on assets of 0.22 percent). Moreover,
they tend to have little capital in excess of the required minimums, a weakness that is
compounded by having inadequate loan loss reserves. At the same time, they have a
very limited ability to raise capital through the market, as failed attempts by two small
lenders demonstrated earlier this year.

In recent weeks, analyst commentary has highlighted rumored capital shortfalls in the
upcoming EU stress‐test results at a few Italian lenders, in particular Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena. (The results will also be closely watched for banks in other countries,
specifically Deutsche Bank, which is struggling with low capital buffers and weak
earnings.) This year, EU regulators have not set an official pass/fail threshold, so the
exact capital shortfalls will not be immediately evident. Weaknesses revealed in the
exercise will, however, be used by supervisors to determine bank‐specific capital needs.
Italy’s authorities are exploring options to support their banks, but they face challenging
economic, legal, and political constraints. Under the EU’s bail‐in rules, injecting public
funds into the banks would likely require imposing losses on bank liabilities. But because
a large fraction of uninsured bank debt is held by Italian retail investors, imposing such
losses would be politically costly, especially ahead of a constitutional referendum in
October on which the government has staked its future. Recent initiatives to tackle the
NPL problem without large‐scale government involvement have been mostly ineffective.
An NPL securitization scheme and a private investment fund set up to help with small
bank recapitalization and NPL sales were seen as positive but inadequate because of
limited private‐sector participation. Currently, a second private fund of about €5 billion—
well below the estimated required capital to address sector‐wide problem loans—has
been discussed. An important factor in banks’ inability to resolve problem loans is the
country’s bankruptcy procedures. Despite recent reforms, banks take several years to
foreclose on defaulted borrowers and claim collateral.
Reportedly, Italy’s authorities, the European Commission, and the EU bank regulators
have not yet agreed on a strategy for solving the situation. As a step to avoid a potential
s
run on the country’s banks, the European Commission authorized a contingency plan of t
n
the Italian government to guarantee bank bond issuance of up to €150 billion until the e
m
end of the year. U.S. banks’ direct exposures to Italian banks are very modest—only p
o
1 percent of U.S. banks’ aggregate Tier 1 capital. Nevertheless, problems addressing the e l
v
weaknesses of Italian banks have the potential for spillovers through a range of e
D
channels—for example, knock‐on effects of a banking crisis on the Italian sovereign and
l
a
other peripheral sovereigns more broadly—which all may result in heightened financial i
c
n
stresses and economic disruptions in Europe and perhaps globally. a

implied path declined more substantially, with the near-term implied policy path
becoming inverted, as investors evidently assigned a nonnegligible probability of a rate
cut at upcoming FOMC meetings. This inversion reversed following domestic data
releases—particularly for employment and retail sales in June—that were generally
viewed as better than expected. At the end of the intermeeting period, market quotes
implied only a slightly positive probability of a rate hike at the July meeting.
According to the Desk’s July surveys of primary dealers and market participants,
respondents assign a probability of near zero to a rate hike at the July meeting. While the
median respondent continues to expect one rate hike by the end of 2016, the timing of the
next rate hike has shifted out from September to December. In addition, the median
dealer’s modal policy path of the target federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018 moved down
substantially. The median investor’s path also moved down. Consistent with these
declines, the median dealer pushed out the likely timing of a change to the Committee’s
policy on reinvestments by about half a year, although the median investor’s likely timing
was relatively little changed.
The Treasury yield curve has flattened slightly, on net, since the June FOMC
meeting. While 2- and 5-year Treasury yields were about unchanged, 10- and 30-year
tenors declined 8 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, on net. Longer-term
nominal Treasury yields had fallen precipitously in the two weeks following the Brexit s

vote before reversing course, and the level of longer-dated yields and the spread between e
m
p
2- and 10-year yields had reached record lows during that period.1 The declines appear to o

reflect a variety of factors, including expectations for a more accommodative stance of v

particular following decreases in sovereign yields in Europe and Japan. Some of these
factors may have been at work for some time now (for further discussion, see the box
“The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields since the Start of the Year”). Most of the
decline in nominal yields appears to be attributable to the decline in real yields, as TIPS-
and swaption-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net.
1 Since the June FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned $144 billion of nominal
fixed-coupon Treasury notes, $5 billion of TIPS, and $13 billion of 2-year Floating Rate Notes.

The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields since the Start of the Year
In the aftermath of the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum, U.S. long-term Treasury yields
fell sharply, reaching new historical lows. The initial sharp decline in yields added to their
already significant drop since the beginning of the year. The decline in long-term yields appears
particularly remarkable over a period during which, on balance, broad equity prices have risen
somewhat, corporate bond spreads are little changed, and the VIX is near the lower end of its
distribution over the past few years. This discussion reviews domestic factors, such as the long-
run outlook for U.S. growth and monetary policy, as well as foreign factors that seem to be
important in explaining the decline in long-term yields since the start of the year.1
Although yields have now largely retraced their declines since Brexit, the 10-year nominal yield
has, on net, fallen 76 basis points (bps) since the beginning of 2016 (figure 1). Even more
pronounced is the 93 bps fall in the 5-to-10-year-forward rate, resulting in a substantial
flattening of the yield curve. Notably, the decline in long-term nominal yields is predominantly
attributable to a decline in real yields. The staff’s term structure model attributes about one-
third of the decline in the 10-year nominal rate so far this year to a decline in average expected
future short rates and the remaining two-thirds to a decline in term premiums (the black lines in
figure 2).2
The decline in the expected short-rate component of yields appears consistent with the steady
decline in expectations for the long-term U.S. economic growth outlook as evidenced by various
survey measures (figure 3). Consistent with this outlook, long-horizon survey forecasts of the
federal funds rate and the median of longer-run “SEP dots” have also moved down (figure 4).3
Because most measures of long-run inflation expectations have remained relatively stable, such
revisions in long-run policy rate expectations should largely reflect decreases in the expected
path of the real short rate, depressing long-term real yields.4
Foreign economic and financial market developments appear to have also played a key role in
t s the sharp decline in yields observed since the beginning of the year, mainly through a decline in
n
e term premiums. In particular, the decline in long-term U.S. yields mirrors the declines in German
m
p and U.K. sovereign yields over the same period, as shown in figure 5, which is a continuation of
o the strong co-movement in global yields evident since 2014.5 More specifically, rolling
l
e
v correlations of U.S. 10-year yield changes with their German and U.K. counterparts have been
e
D consistently high (figure 6).
l
a
c
i
n
a 1 Long-dated U.S. yields also fell sharply from 2010 to 2012, reaching then-historical lows in mid-2012. While
n
F i that occurred during the European debt crisis, the weak domestic economic outlook and the Federal Reserve’s
increasingly accommodative stance of monetary policy at the time seemed to set the 2010–12 period apart from
the current period of low U.S. rates. Notably, the swaption-implied skew of the 10-year swap rate is currently
significantly lower than its level in 2010 through 2012, implying increased demand for protection against even
further yield declines.
2 In turn, about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums can be attributed to the decline in real
term premiums. This proportion is roughly similar for both the pre- and post-Brexit samples.
3 A related measure, the real rate consistent with the economy operating near potential (the “neutral”
rate), has also declined steadily. See Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of
Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (4), pp. 1063–70.
4 If such downward revisions are associated with increased uncertainty regarding the long-run economic
outlook, real term premiums may also fall. Moreover, the decline in nominal yields reflects some decline in
inflation compensation since the end of 2015.
5 The staff’s March 2015 memorandum to the FOMC, “Recent Declines in Long-Term Interest Rates: Causes
and Possible Implications,” argued that global factors were important contributors to the decline in U.S. long-
term Treasury yields since the beginning of 2014.

With the outlook for the U.S. economy still positive, the decline in estimates of U.S. term
premiums, which appears to be more pronounced than in other countries (for example, in
Germany, the blue lines in figure 2), is consistent with reported increased demand for relatively
safe and higher-yielding Treasury securities at a time of extremely low and even negative yields
in other advanced economies. In turn, the decline in advanced foreign yields appears to stem,
at least in part, from concerns over their local economic outlooks and expectations for a
continuation of highly accommodative monetary policy. Indeed, market commentaries have
mainly pointed to concerns over the global economic outlook as the reason why U.S. yields fell
sharply in January (in the wake of heightened uncertainty regarding China and the broader
global economy) and again in late June (associated with the British referendum).6 Market
commentaries have also repeatedly pointed to foreign investors moving into U.S. Treasury
securities as sovereign yields in Europe and Japan have declined further.7 Staff analysis
provides some statistical support for this hypothesis; for example, standard “Granger causality”
tests show that the probability that changes in German or U.K. long-end forward rates can
predict changes in U.S. long-end forward rates has recently increased to historically high levels
(not shown).

6 In response to a special question in the July Desk surveys, respondents cited “spillovers from
low/declining yields abroad” as the most important factor behind the decline in the U.S. 5-to-10-year nominal
forward rate in both the January 1–June 14 and June 15–July 12 periods, while the second most important factor
was cited to be “changes in outlook for U.S. economic growth” for the January 1–June 14 period and “safe
haven demand” for the June 15–July 12 period.
7 The recent decline in the long-term cross-currency basis swap spreads for the dollar versus advanced
economy currency pairs appears consistent with increased demand for dollar-denominated assets.

Production-coupon agency MBS spreads to Treasury securities narrowed slightly, driven
by demand from foreign and domestic banks.
Broad stock price indexes increased moderately, on net, since the June FOMC
meeting, supported by the same factors that appear to have boosted global equity prices.
The VIX declined during the intermeeting period, returning to the lower end of its
distribution over the past few years. U.S. bank stock prices dropped sharply after the
Brexit vote but have since retraced that decrease, supported by better-than-expected
earnings reports of some of the largest domestic banks (see the box “The Effect of Brexit
on U.S. Bank Stocks” for additional discussion of the recent behavior of those bank
stocks).
Based on earnings reports for 12 percent of firms in the S&P 500 index and Wall
Street analyst forecasts for the rest, second-quarter earnings per share are projected to
increase slightly from the previous quarter, recovering only part of their sharp decline
earlier in the year. Even so, the outlook for corporate earnings showed signs of
stabilization, as analyst forecasts for year-ahead earnings were revised down only slightly
in July.

maturity Treasury securities ended the period somewhat lower, on net, and spreads of

Overall, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms have remained
accommodative since the June FOMC meeting. In June, gross issuance of corporate
bonds remained robust, particularly for the investment-grade sector. Issuance slowed
significantly in early July for both investment- and speculate-grade bonds, in part
reflecting seasonal factors. Aggregate commercial and industrial (C&I) lending by banks
continued to expand through early July, although such lending by large domestic and
foreign banks slowed in June. This pattern is consistent with the responses to the July

The Effect of Brexit on U.S. Bank Stocks
Following the U.K. referendum to exit the European Union (EU), or “Brexit,” the
equity prices of U.S. banks declined significantly more than broader U.S. equity
indexes.1 In particular, two days following the Brexit vote, the S&P 500 bank
index, the set of bank stocks contained in the broader S&P 500 index, dropped
10 percent, while the S&P 500 index as a whole fell 5 percent (figure 2). In recent
weeks, bank stocks largely retraced their post-Brexit declines but remain at price
levels much below those witnessed one year ago (figure 1).
The relative underperformance of bank stocks following the Brexit vote could
reflect investor concerns regarding banks’ direct exposures to the United
Kingdom and EU as well as more general concerns regarding banks’ future
profitability; for example, lower expected long-term interest rates, and a flatter
yield curve, could reduce net interest margins on interest-bearing assets, such as
loans. We explore the extent to which such factors likely contributed to the
performance of U.S. bank stocks following the Brexit vote.
To gauge the extent to which lower expected profitability due to lower expected
long-term interest rates, and a flatter yield curve, may have affected bank stock
returns following the Brexit vote, we separately considered banks with a higher
ratio of loans to assets (a measure of commercial banking focus), those with a
bigger duration gap (a measure of the degree of maturity transformation in a
bank’s loan and securities portfolios), and those with higher current net interest
margins. To gauge whether concerns about lower future trading revenues and
t s investment banking fees may have affected bank stock returns following the
n
e Brexit vote, we also separately considered banks for which trading and
m
p investment banking comprise a greater share of their income.

We then examined the correlations between these bank characteristics and
banks’ relative stock returns. As shown in the first and second columns of the
table below, banks with larger loans-to-assets ratios and bigger duration gaps
had lower relative stock returns following the Brexit vote, and banks with higher
current net interest margins had higher relative returns. The correlations are
statistically significant for the loans-to-assets and duration gap measures.
We did not find that banks with a greater share of trading and investment
banking income experienced lower relative stock returns following the Brexit
vote. However, such banks have had lower relative returns year-to-date, a period
which includes the bout of financial market volatility early in the year, as shown in
the third column in the table. We did find that banks with more specialized credit
card lending or custodial business had relatively higher returns in all three
periods considered.
We also did not find that banks with greater exposures to the United Kingdom
and EU experienced significantly lower relative stock returns following the Brexit
vote. Year-to-date, however, banks with greater exposures to the EU have
experienced lower relative returns, perhaps reflecting more general concerns
about the health of EU economies and financial institutions.2
Overall, the relative returns of U.S. bank stocks following the Brexit vote appear
to have been largely driven by concerns about the future profitabilitiy of banks
more generally, rather than concerns about their direct exposures to the United
Kingdom and EU. Indeed, the banks whose stocks witnessed the largest price
declines following the vote were those whose profitability seems to be most
affected by lower U.S. economic growth and lower long-term interest rates. t s

2016 SLOOS, in which a modest fraction of respondents indicated that they had tightened
their C&I lending standards and experienced weaker demand for such loans during the
second quarter on net.
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to weaken,
though there are some indications that the pace of deterioration is subsiding. The net
volume of bonds downgraded in the second quarter was notably smaller than in the
previous quarter. Even so, actual default rates of nonfinancial bonds and the KMV
measure of expected year-ahead defaults both remained elevated relative to the ranges
that typically prevail during expansions.
Financing conditions in commercial real estate stayed fairly accommodative, on
balance, and bank lending in all major categories was strong through June. CMBS
spreads did not appear to have been affected by the Brexit vote. They remain elevated,
however, which has suppressed CMBS issuance markedly so far this year. Meanwhile,
CMBS delinquency rates have edged up for the third consecutive month, largely driven
by the inability of some borrowers to pay off or refinance loans that reached their
maturity. Relatedly, a significant net fraction of respondents to the July SLOOS
indicated that they had tightened their CRE lending standards on all major loan categories
during the second quarter.

fixed mortgages fell 8 basis points over the intermeeting period, on net, to a level of
3.3 percent. A number of large banks noted in the July SLOOS an easing of standards for
GSE-eligible home-purchase loans. Respondents also noted a broad-based pickup in
demand across most major categories of home-purchase loans. Indicators suggest that
refinance activity may be picking up in response to the recent drop in mortgage rates.
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed and
remained largely accommodative against a backdrop of stable credit performance across
debt categories. Growth in auto balances remained robust, though respondents to the July
SLOOS indicated that they had tightened their standards on auto loans. Credit card
balances continued to grow moderately, on balance, and stand 5½ percent higher than
levels seen a year ago. Despite the volatility in financial markets in the early part of the
intermeeting period, spreads for credit card and auto loan ABS remained largely stable
and ABS issuance is expected to pick up in the coming weeks.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Over the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds and Eurodollar rates
traded within the target range.2 Overnight Treasury GCF and triparty GC repo rates rose
notably on the day following the Brexit vote but quickly retraced to near pre-Brexit
levels. Secured and unsecured borrowings by U.K.- and EU-based borrowers were stable

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, importantly because both monetary and fiscal
policy appear to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than adverse ones.
We also continue to view foreign developments and prospects as posing downside risks
to the U.S. economy: Foreign authorities face significant constraints in providing policy
stimulus, and concerns about financial fragility in Europe could spur a new wave of
financial turmoil. We view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned
with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to the upside.
With regard to inflation, we see considerable uncertainty around our projection,
but we do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high. At the same time,
we continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain very low, as do some survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations. In addition, the realization of the
downside risks to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the foreign exchange
value of the dollar, thereby depressing import prices and inflation.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance assessment. The vulnerability of the U.S. financial system
appears moderate overall, reflecting strong capital and liquidity positions at banks,
moderate leverage in the nonbank financial sector, and subdued borrowing by
households. These factors, together with the preparations undertaken by many market
participants ahead of the Brexit vote, have likely helped account for the relatively
transient spillover effects of Brexit thus far to U.S. financial markets; even so, U.S.

prices continued to increase briskly, recent indicators may point to diminished risk
appetite on the part of investors in this sector.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first
scenario explores the consequences of heightened financial stress in Europe that
generates sizable spillovers to the global economy. In contrast, in the second scenario, a
positive outlook for consumer spending and upbeat consumer confidence signal that
economic activity is stronger than in the baseline. The third scenario considers the
possibility that a deterioration in long-term inflation expectations might be indicative of
weaker aggregate demand. Finally, the last two scenarios explore the consequences of
continued subdued labor productivity growth, with different implications for the outlook
for inflation.
The first scenario is run in the multicountry SIGMA model, while the final four
use the EDO model. In all the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the same
inertial policy rule as in the baseline, including the adjustments to the intercept in the near
term; these intercept adjustments are invariant to economic events in the scenarios. In all
cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow the
baseline paths.
Severe Financial Stress in Europe
As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook box
“Global Implications of the U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union,” our baseline
assumption is that the economic effects of Brexit outside Europe will remain fairly
contained. However, Brexit may have substantially more-adverse consequences, either
because it reinforces anti-EU sentiment and triggers other breakaway movements, or
because it highlights vulnerabilities in the European banking system that undermine
confidence in peripheral governments’ fiscal situation and EU financial backstops; either
outcome could lead, in extreme circumstances, to another European financial crisis. In y

emerge. EU corporate borrowing spreads shoot up 175 basis points, while household
borrowing spreads rise about 90 basis points. As a result, EU GDP falls almost 6 percent
below the baseline by the end of 2018. The EU crisis has substantial adverse spillovers
to the United States. U.S. corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 60 basis
points above the baseline, while flight-to-safety flows cause the trade-weighted dollar to
appreciate by 10 percent and depress 10-year Treasury yields modestly. Financial
conditions tighten even more in the EMEs, and their currencies depreciate substantially.1
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall
relative to the baseline while lower confidence and weaker financial conditions depress
U.S. domestic demand. All told, U.S. real GDP expands only 1¼ percent in 2017—about
1¼ percentage points less than in the baseline—and 1¾ percent in 2018. The U.S.
unemployment rate runs at around 5 percent in 2017 and 2018 and is about ¾ percentage
point higher than in the baseline at the end of 2018. Lower resource utilization and
falling import prices reduce U.S. core PCE inflation to just under 1 percent by 2017. The
federal funds rate follows a shallow path, reaching only 1½ percent at the end of 2018.
Consumer-Driven Expansion
Although growth of consumer spending was weak earlier in the year, the staff
estimates that PCE increased at a robust 4¼ percent annual rate last quarter. Moreover,
consumer confidence has remained reasonably upbeat, and there are signs of some wage
acceleration, which could support households’ income and further boost confidence.
In this scenario, we assume faster consumer spending growth that, in turn, spurs
production and higher business investment.2 As a result, real GDP rises 2¾ percent in
2016, compared with 1¾ percent in the baseline projection. The unemployment rate falls
steeply, bottoming out at a touch below 4 percent by the end of 2018; it then edges up
over the remainder of the forecast period but stays lower than in the baseline. With
resource utilization running tight, inflation is a little higher than in the baseline, reaching
2 percent in 2019. The federal funds rate rises more steeply, reaching 4 percent by the
end of 2019.

Lower Inflation Expectations from Weaker Demand
Several measures of longer-run inflation expectations are currently near the lower
end of their historical ranges. In past Tealbooks, we have examined one interpretation of
this declining trend in inflation expectations by assuming that it reflects, among other
factors, a different expectations formation process than in the baseline.3 In this scenario,
we take a different approach and consider the possibility that the deterioration of inflation
expectations may be driven by perceptions of persistently weaker economic activity than
in the baseline; this outlook is ratified over the projection period. We calibrate this
scenario such that these forces depress five-year expectations of inflation, as of the third
quarter of 2016, by 25 basis points relative to the baseline.
Under these circumstances, actual inflation is only 1½ percent in 2017,
¼ percentage point below the baseline, and is still at 1¾ percent at the end of 2020.
Inflation remains persistently below target in part because the response to low inflation in
the baseline policy rule is not very aggressive. The moderately weaker path for aggregate
demand that is associated with this lower path of inflation reduces GDP growth for 2016
by ½ percentage point, with little effect on growth beyond mid-2017; the unemployment
rate remains around 5 percent until the second half of 2017. The federal funds rate runs
about ½ percentage point lower than in the baseline for several years.
Weaker Productivity with Higher Inflation
Labor productivity growth has been weak over the past several years, averaging
less than ½ percent per year from 2011 through 2015. In the baseline projection,
productivity growth is assumed to pick up to an average annual rate of 1¼ percent in
2017 and 2018, about the average pace over the past 10 years. However, the recent
subdued growth of productivity may persist longer than in the baseline. In this scenario,
labor productivity growth is assumed to remain at only ½ percent per year over the first
two years of the scenario before gradually moving up to the baseline pace.4 The weaker

path of labor productivity is driven by a combination of lower total factor productivity
growth and positive shocks to aggregate demand.5
Although real GDP grows somewhat more slowly than in the baseline, the
unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory, declining to 4 percent by the end of 2018,
consistent with the weaker labor productivity and positive shocks to aggregate demand.
These forces drive up firms’ marginal costs of production, leading to a higher path of
inflation, which reaches 2½ percent in 2018 and remains above the Committee’s target in
2020. As a result, the path of the federal funds rate is steeper than in the baseline,
reaching 5 percent by the end of 2020. As noted in the previous scenario, the baseline
policy rule does not react very aggressively to deviations of inflation from target, and
this relatively tepid reaction of monetary policy to inflation contributes to the persistence
of high inflation. A more aggressive policy reaction could mitigate both the persistence
of inflation and the degree to which inflation rises in the first place.
Weaker Productivity with Moderate Inflation
In the past few years, sluggish gains in labor productivity have not been
accompanied by the notable inflationary pressures portrayed in the preceding scenario; it
is possible that the forces identified by the EDO model that have prevented faster growth
in wages and prices might also persist in the future. In this scenario, we assume that the
upward pressure on inflation, caused by the lower total factor productivity and positive
demand shocks of the previous scenario, manifests itself less markedly.
In particular, we assume that labor productivity follows the same path as in the
preceding scenario but that aggregate demand shocks are not as large, total factor
productivity growth is slightly weaker, and wage growth is more restrained. On balance,
these forces temper the rise in inflation, which exceeds the baseline by less than
¼ percentage point. Under these circumstances, real GDP growth is noticeably weaker
than the baseline; however, the corresponding reduction in potential output growth yields
an unemployment rate that is only a touch lower than in the baseline. With little change
to the path of inflation and the output gap, the federal funds rate is only ½ percentage

In this scenario, the federal funds rate turns out to follow a trajectory broadly
similar to the baseline despite substantial negative shocks to productivity over the next
two years. One reason is that aggregate demand falls essentially in line with aggregate
supply without additional monetary policy intervention; another reason is that shocks
were chosen to yield an inflation outcome that is little changed. This scenario could have
very different implications for monetary policy if total factor productivity growth were
assumed to be permanently weaker, along the lines of the secular stagnation hypothesis,
and, hence, the implied longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate were lower.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that yy

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
