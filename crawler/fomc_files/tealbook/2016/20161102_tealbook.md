Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Incoming data indicate that the economy is expanding at a moderate rate. Real D
n
GDP growth remains on track to pick up from its weak first-half pace, as business o
c
E
investment turns up and the drag from inventory investment ends. However, the
c
i
t
projected rate of growth in the second half—at 2¼ percent—is a bit lower than in the s
e
m
September Tealbook, reflecting the somewhat softer-than-expected readings on consumer o
D
spending in recent months. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have continued to
improve, and we view the economy as essentially at full employment.
Beyond this year, we project real GDP to increase 2¼ percent in 2017,
½ percentage point stronger than this year, with continued solid gains in consumer
spending and a pickup in both residential and business investment. Over 2018 and 2019,
output growth slows gradually to its longer-run trend of 1¾ percent, as monetary policy
tightens and the stimulus from fiscal policy diminishes. Our medium-term projection for
real GDP growth is a bit weaker than in the September Tealbook, reflecting the effects of
both a slightly stronger dollar and higher oil prices, but growth is still sufficient to tighten
resource utilization further. In particular, GDP is projected to be 1¼ percent above its
potential level at the end of 2018 and in 2019. Correspondingly, we project the
unemployment rate to fall to around 4½ percent by mid-2018—about ½ percentage point
below our estimate of its natural rate—and the labor force participation rate to continue to
run above its trend. Consistent with the slightly weaker pace of output growth in this
projection, these measures of resource utilization show a little less tightening than in the
September Tealbook.
The near-term inflation forecast is somewhat higher than in the September
Tealbook, reflecting upside surprises in the incoming data for both core and energy
prices. We now expect the 12-month change in total PCE prices to move up from
1.0 percent in August, the most recent published data, to 1.6 percent by December, as
energy prices pick up. The 12-month change in core PCE prices is projected to edge up
from 1.7 percent in August to 1.8 percent in December, a path that is slightly higher than
in the September Tealbook. We also nudged up our forecast of both total and core PCE
inflation for next year by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7 percent; otherwise, the medium-term
inflation forecast is little changed from the September Tealbook. We continue to project
that PCE price inflation will move up gradually to 1.9 percent in 2019, as the effects of

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
v
e The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is close to the median projection from
D
the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in
n
o 2016 as well as the Blue Chip in 2017. (The SPF forecast is released quarterly and is
c
E about two months old; we await the next release on November 14.) The staff’s
c
i forecast for the unemployment rate is slightly above the others in 2016 and in line
t
s
e with the Blue Chip in 2017. The staff’s projection for CPI inflation is slightly above
m
o the outside forecasters in 2016 but in line with them in 2017. The staff’s projections
D
for total and core PCE price inflation are somewhat lower than the SPF in 2016
and 2017.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
D
e
n
o
Monetary Policy c
E
c
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule (with the intercept adjustments introduced in i
t
s
e
the June Tealbook) that we use to mechanically set the federal funds rate in m
o
our projection calls for the federal funds rate to increase about 80 basis points D
per year over the projection period and to average about 3 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2019. The federal funds rate at that time is about 25 basis
points above our assumption for its long-run equilibrium level as a result of
the positive output gap. Even so, the path for the federal funds rate is a bit
lower than in the September Tealbook due to the slightly lower output gap in
the current projection.
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current
level until the third quarter of 2017 and then begin to contract, as the proceeds
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.
Other Interest Rates
 Compared with the September Tealbook, we have revised down the projected
path of the 10-year Treasury yield through 2019 in response to the lower path
of future short-term interest rates. Nevertheless, we continue to expect that
the 10-year Treasury yield will rise significantly over the medium term,
reflecting both the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the
period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a rising term premium.
 Investment-grade corporate bond spreads have narrowed more than we
anticipated, leading us to revise down our projection for investment-grade
corporate yields slightly more than that for 10-year Treasury yields in the near
term. The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was revised down in line with
the revision to Treasury yields.

o
l
u t Equity Prices and Home Prices
O
&  The projected path of stock prices is little changed. Equity prices are
l
e projected to rise at an average annual rate of about 1½ percent over the
v
e
D
projection period.
n
o
c
E  Recent data on house prices were as expected. We continue to project a
c
i
s t modest deceleration in home values from an increase of 5½ percent in 2016 to
e
m
an average annual increase of 3¾ percent over the medium term.
o
D
Fiscal Policy
 We assume that discretionary policy actions at all levels of government will
boost real GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point this year and next, with
smaller contributions in 2018 and 2019. The support from fiscal policy is
slightly less in the near term than in the September Tealbook, primarily
reflecting weaker-than-expected state and local government purchases. As we
had anticipated, the Congress passed a continuing resolution in September to
fund the government through early December, and we expect further
extensions in funding thereafter to occur without major disruption.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 We estimate that foreign real GDP growth rebounded from an annual rate of
just under 1 percent in the second quarter to an estimated 2½ percent pace in
the third quarter, as economic activity in Canada and Mexico bounced back.
Foreign economic growth is projected to stay at about this rate over the
remainder of the forecast period, supported in part by accommodative
monetary policies abroad. The near-term outlook is slightly weaker relative to
the September Tealbook, with softer data in some emerging market economies
and a markdown in growth prospects for Canada and the United Kingdom.
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated about 1¼ percent since the time of
the September Tealbook. The dollar rose against nearly all of the currencies
of the advanced foreign economies, with an especially pronounced
appreciation against the British pound. In contrast, the dollar is close to
unchanged against the currencies of emerging market economies. We expect
the broad nominal dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of about 2¼ percent
over the medium term, as market expectations for the federal funds rate move

k
o
o
l
up toward the staff’s assumption. This rate of increase in the value of the u t
O
dollar is slightly lower than in the September Tealbook, as the difference
&
between the staff’s assumptions and market expectations for U.S. monetary e l
v
e
policy narrowed somewhat during the intermeeting period. D
n
o
c
Oil Prices E
c
i
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has increased more than $4 since the s t
e
m
September Tealbook to $51.50 per barrel, supported by news that OPEC
o
D
member countries and Russia may cut oil production. Futures prices have
increased since the previous Tealbook, with the December 2019 Brent futures
prices at $59 per barrel, up about $3 per barrel.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
Real GDP growth is expected to pick up from an annual rate of about 1 percent in
the first half of this year to 2¼ percent in the second half, reflecting an upturn in business
fixed investment and a positive swing in the contribution from inventory investment.
This projected rebound in GDP growth is slightly less than in the September Tealbook,
with the downward revision concentrated in consumer spending.
 We currently estimate that real GDP increased 2½ percent in the third
quarter.1 For the fourth quarter, we forecast real GDP growth of 2 percent.2
GDP growth in both quarters is about ¼ percentage point lower than in the
previous Tealbook; the downward revisions were concentrated in private
domestic final purchases (PDFP), which we think provides a better indication
of the underlying pace of economic activity than overall GDP, so we have also
nudged down GDP growth early next year.
1 The median of the third-quarter forecasts within the System, as displayed in the table “Federal
Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” is 2.1 percent, which is a bit lower than the
staff’s estimate.
After the close of the forecast for this Tealbook, the Census Bureau released an advanced estimate
of September goods trade. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the net export contribution to GDP
growth increased to ¾ percentage point in the third quarter, as imports were weaker than expected and
exports were stronger. Our straight read of these data would imply third-quarter GDP growth of 3 percent.
However, the BEA will publish its advance estimate of third-quarter GDP on Friday, October 28.
2 We estimate that Hurricane Matthew will subtract 0.1 percentage point from GDP growth in the
fourth quarter and that growth in the first quarter will be higher by a similar amount.

 We expect business fixed investment to turn up in the second half of this year u
O
following notable declines in the first half. New orders for nondefense capital &
l
goods appear to have stabilized in recent months, and we expect a modest e
v
e
increase in equipment investment in the second half. Meanwhile, intangible D
n
investment appears to have continued growing steadily. With regard to o
c
E
nonresidential structures, recent increases in the number of drilling rigs in
c
i
t
operation indicate that investment in energy-related structures is on track to s
e
m
move up in the fourth quarter following seven consecutive quarterly declines. o
D
Outside of drilling and mining, recent indicators suggest that outlays for
nonresidential structures are increasing at a modest pace. Overall, our
forecast for business investment in the second half is little changed from the
September Tealbook.
 As in the September Tealbook, inventory investment is expected to slightly
boost GDP growth in the second half of the year after subtracting
¾ percentage point in the first half. Nominal book values through August
suggest less of a decline in inventory investment in the third quarter than in
the second quarter, and the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system shows no
significant inventory imbalances outside of the energy sector. Partly on this
basis, and with steady growth in PDFP, we expect a slow rebuilding of
inventories to begin this quarter.
 Growth in consumer spending is expected to average 2¼ percent in the second
half of this year, supported by continued solid gains in employment and
household income as well as earlier increases in household wealth. Even so,
the incoming data on consumer spending have been somewhat weaker, on
balance, than expected in the September Tealbook, with disappointing retail
sales for both August and September more than offsetting an upside surprise
to light motor vehicle sales in September. In response, we marked down
consumer spending growth through early next year.
 We continue to expect residential investment to flatten out in the fourth
quarter after declining in the two previous quarters. As we had anticipated,
single-family starts recovered from their sharp decline in August, but taking a
somewhat longer view, single-family construction still seems to be moving

net export contribution in the third quarter from a negative to a positive
¼ percentage point, though we expect that a drawdown in farm-product
inventories will offset some of the topline GDP effect. In the fourth quarter,
we continue to expect net exports to subtract about ¼ percentage point from
GDP growth. We continue to view the underlying pace of export growth as
being held down by a strong dollar and weak foreign demand.
 The level of manufacturing production has changed little, on net, in recent
months (or, indeed, since late 2014), restrained by weak export demand,
spillovers from earlier declines in oil and gas drilling, and slow domestic
capital investment more generally. We expect factory output to continue on
this flat trajectory in the fourth quarter despite some modest improvement
recently in the readings for new orders from the national and regional
manufacturing surveys.
Relative to its pace over 2016 as whole, GDP growth is projected to step up to
about 2¼ percent in 2017, reflecting continued solid gains in consumer spending and a
pickup in both residential and business investment. GDP growth then eases to 2 percent
in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019 as monetary policy gradually tightens and the stimulus
from fiscal policy diminishes.
 Our projection for real GDP growth over the medium term is a bit weaker than
in the September Tealbook, reflecting a small reaction to disappointing
spending data this year as well as the anticipated effects on economic activity
from a slightly stronger dollar and higher oil prices.
3 Multifamily starts recorded an outsized decline in September, but given the volatility in this
series, we took no signal from these data for our forecast.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
Labor market conditions have continued to improve so far this year, with solid job
growth as well as an increase in labor force participation relative to its downward trend,
and we are projecting further improvements through the medium term.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment rose 156,000 in September.4 While
private payrolls grew in line with our September forecast, state and local
government employment, particularly in education, declined unexpectedly.
We view the recent weakness in state and local education employment as
payback for unusual strength earlier in the summer and thus took little signal
from the September data for this sector. Accordingly, we anticipate that total
payrolls will increase 175,000 per month, on average, in the fourth quarter,
about the same as in our September projection.5
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate rounded up to 5.0 percent in
September, whereas we had projected it to hold at 4.9 percent. We expect the
unemployment rate to edge back down to 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter,
which would put it at the same level as it was at the beginning of this year.
 In response to the surprising strength in the labor force participation rate so far
this year—including another uptick in September to 62.9 percent—we nudged
4 Nonfarm payrolls were revised up nearly 20,000 in August, close to the 30,000 revision we
penciled in to the September Tealbook based on the sizable upward revisions to August employment in
recent years.
5 We estimate that Hurricane Matthew, which struck during the reference week for the October
employment report, depressed payrolls by 10,000 and will boost payroll gains by the same amount in
November, leaving no imprint on the average monthly change in the fourth quarter.

u t up our forecast for the participation rate slightly over the next year and a half

to show a little more overshooting relative to its trend. We now expect the

E  It continues to be our view that the labor market is now essentially at full

t i employment. In the fourth quarter, we expect the unemployment rate to be
s
e
m 0.1 percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate, while the
o
D
participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio will be slightly
above our estimates of their trends. Meanwhile, the share of employees
working part time for economic reasons, even with its decline in September,
remains slightly elevated and likely is a small source of labor underutilization.
(As discussed in the box “The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on
Employer Health-Care Costs and Part-Time Employment,” we do not see
much convincing evidence, at least as of yet, that the new health insurance
mandates required by the Affordable Care Act have boosted the share of part-
time employment.)
 The labor market conditions index, or LMCI, declined further in September,
partially because of the uptick in the unemployment rate, and remains at odds
with the staff’s assessment that labor market conditions have continued to
improve.
The medium-term outlook for the labor market is a bit softer than our September
projection, reflecting the small downward revision to the forecast for GDP growth over
the next three years.
 We expect average monthly total payroll gains to slow from about 170,000 in
2017 to about 130,000 in 2018 and 100,000 in 2019. By 2019, the pace of
employment growth is expected to have moved down into the range that we
view as consistent with unchanged labor utilization. The path of monthly job
gains over the medium term is about 10,000 lower than in the September
Tealbook.
 Labor market conditions are expected to tighten further over the next couple
of years, though by slightly less than in our previous forecast.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The incoming data on consumer prices have been somewhat higher than we had
anticipated in the September Tealbook, which led us to revise up our projection for both
core and total PCE inflation this year and next.
 We expect that swings in energy prices will cause the 12-month change in
total PCE prices to move up from 1.0 percent in August to 1.6 percent by
December, with a further small increase early next year. In contrast, the
trajectory for core PCE price inflation is relatively flat, with the 12-month
change expected to remain near its August reading of 1.7 percent through the
end of 2017. The projections for total and core PCE price inflation are revised
up 0.3 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point, respectively, in 2016.
 Measured on a quarterly average basis, core PCE price inflation is expected to
slow in the second half of this year relative to the first half, when inflation was
boosted by some volatile price categories and what appears to be residual
seasonality. Nevertheless, core goods prices have surprised us to the upside,
partly reflecting unusually large increases in prescription drug prices. In
addition, core services prices—both market- and non-market-based—have
slowed less in recent months than we expected. As a result, we now project
core PCE price inflation to be 1.6 percent in the second half, ¼ percentage
point higher than in our previous forecast.6
 PCE energy prices are projected to jump at an annual rate of about 25 percent
in the fourth quarter, a much faster pace than in the September Tealbook,
6 By contrast, core CPI prices have come in about as expected, and we did not change our second-
half forecast for core CPI inflation.

The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Employer Health-Care
&
l Costs and Part-Time Employment
e
v
e
D
There are concerns that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has raised health insurance costs for
n
o employers and is leading firms to shift full-time workers to part-time status to avoid ACA penalties.
c
E However, we find little convincing support in the data that employer health-care costs have
c increased as a result of the ACA mandates or that employers have raised the share of part-time
i
t
s employment in response to the ACA, although workers appear to be facing a higher share of
e
m
health-care costs. Nevertheless, it is not possible to observe what would have happened in the
o
D absence of the ACA, and the effects of the implementation of the ACA mandates may take
additional time to fully appear. For both of these reasons, drawing firm conclusions remains
difficult.
After various delays, the employer mandate began in 2015 for firms with 100 or more full-time
equivalent (FTE) employees and in 2016 for firms with 50 to 99 FTEs.1 The mandate requires
employers to offer health insurance coverage to employees working 30 or more hours per week or
pay a penalty of $2,000 per FTE per year. Even if insurance is offered, the employer can still be
penalized if the insurance fails to provide “minimal essential coverage,” be affordable (the
employee contribution can be no more than 9½ percent of earnings), and cover family members
through age 26.
The aggregate data do not provide convincing evidence that the ACA has significantly pushed up
employers’ health insurance costs. As shown in figure 1, employers’ health insurance costs (as
measured by the employment cost index) increased at an annual rate of about 3 percent in 2015
and over the first half of 2016, similar to the pace of increase seen over the preceding several years.
Nonetheless, there are a number of actions that employers may have undertaken in response to
the ACA to help reduce their costs per employee covered. Indeed, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s
annual Employer Health Benefits Survey documents greater use of high deductible plans—from
20 percent of workers with health insurance coverage in 2014 to 29 percent in 2016. These high

deductible plans generally cost employers less by shifting more of the cost of health care on to the O
employee. &
l
e
An additional way to lower costs is to decrease the number of employees that are newly eligible for v
e
D
health insurance either by replacing full-time workers with part-time workers or by simply
n
eliminating full-time positions. However, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s survey shows that, on net, o
c
more firms reported to have switched workers from part-time to full-time status in response to the E
ACA rather than vice versa.2 Further, only 3 percent of responding firms indicated that they c
i
t
intended to reduce hiring for full-time positions in order to contain health insurance costs due to s
e
the ACA. m
o
D
Following the approach taken in several academic studies, figure 2 compares the share of people
working 30 to 34 hours with the share working 25 to 29 hours.3 If the ACA were causing employers
to shift workers’ hours below the threshold, we would expect to see a decrease in the share
working above 30 hours relative to the share working below 30 hours a week. However, there is
no clear evidence that such a shift has occurred. Figure 2 shows that the relative share displays a
pronounced cyclical pattern, spiking upward in 2008 but recovering to its average level over 2005
to 2007 by the beginning of 2015. The relative share has roughly moved sideways since the
mandate went into effect in 2015, both in the aggregate (the red line) and among workers in the
lowest wage quintile (the blue line), who are the most likely to be affected by the employer
mandate.4 In contrast, the relative share would likely have shown a steep decline if employers
were shifting large numbers of workers below the 30-hour threshold in response to the ACA.
Finally, a survey of recent empirical studies conducted by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond concludes that there is little evidence that the ACA has had an effect on part-time
status.5 However, as suggested in a study of the Massachusetts health-care law that passed in
2007—which has many similarities with the ACA—an increase in part-time employment due to the
ACA may emerge over a longer time horizon.6
2 While the survey offers no explanation for this surprising finding, one possibility is that the individual
mandate may have led workers to place more value on employer-provided health insurance; from the employer’s
perspective, it is typically more cost effective to insure full-time workers.

Part-Time Employment?” Applied Economic Letters, vol. 23 (3); see also Asako S. Moriya, Thomas M. Selden, and
Kosali I. Simon (2016), “Little Change Seen in Part-Time Employment as a Result of the Affordable Care Act,” Health
Affairs, vol. 35 (1), pp. 119–23.
4 Among other reasons, workers in the lowest wage quintiles likely cost more for employers to insure because
the affordability requirement of the ACA limits the cost sharing based, in part, on the earnings of the worker.

Time Employment,” Economic Brief No. 16-10 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, October),

 In contrast, PCE food prices declined in September by somewhat more than e
D
we were anticipating. Agricultural prices for both crops and meat have n
o
c
continued to decline, reflecting record U.S. production of corn, soybeans, E
c
poultry, and pork. We now expect consumer food prices to decrease t i
s
e
1¼ percent in the second half of this year, nearly 1 percentage point more of a m

decline than in the September Tealbook.
 Core import prices are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of
1¾ percent in the third quarter, a slight downward revision relative to the
September Tealbook but nevertheless the largest increase in over two years.
We expect core import prices to rise at a moderate ¾ percent pace through the
remainder of the forecast, held down by projected dollar appreciation.
 Recent readings on longer-term inflation expectations have remained
relatively stable on balance. The median of inflation expectations over the
next 5 to 10 years from the preliminary Michigan survey moved down to
2.4 percent in early October, which, if maintained in the final report, would
represent a new historical low. In contrast, expected PCE price inflation over
the next 10 years from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of
Professional Forecasters remained at 2 percent in the third quarter. The
3-year-ahead measure of inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was 2.6 percent in September,
close to its average over the first half of the year but below its level in
preceding years. The TIPS-based measure of 5-year-forward inflation
compensation, while still low at 1.6 percent, has moved up since the time of
the September Tealbook.
Beyond the near term, we continue to project a gradual rise in inflation toward the
FOMC’s objective of 2 percent. Given the cumulative surprise in the inflation data so far
this year, we decided to adjust up our forecast of core PCE price inflation in 2017 by
0.1 percentage point to 1.7 percent. Core PCE price inflation is then projected to move
up to 1.9 percent by 2019, primarily reflecting the waning restraint from earlier declines
in energy and import prices along with a further tightening in resource utilization. With
consumer food and energy prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices after

Hourly labor compensation growth is projected to gradually pick up from
2½ percent this year to 3¼ percent in 2019, as the labor market tightens further.
Incoming data led to an upward revision of ¼ percentage point in the rate of
compensation growth this year relative to the September Tealbook. Over the medium
term, compensation growth is revised down slightly, reflecting the somewhat smaller
projected decline in the unemployment rate.
 Average hourly earnings of all employees in September rose a little faster than
we had expected, boosting the 12-month change to 2.6 percent. In general,
this measure of wage growth has been trending up in recent quarters relative
to its 2 percent range from 2012 to late 2014.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker, a measure of
hourly wage growth that is constructed from Current Population Survey data
and that is more pro-cyclical than average hourly earnings, has moved up
from around 3 percent to 3½ percent over the past year and a half but remains
below pre-recession levels.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 The natural rate of unemployment remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP
increases at about its long-run value of 1.7 percent per year starting in 2020.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by the end of 2021.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Recent data point to a bounceback in foreign real GDP growth to an estimated
2½ percent in the third quarter, up from just below 1 percent in the second. Indicators in
Canada and Mexico, where the second-quarter dip was concentrated, strengthened
notably. Foreign growth should remain at about this near-trend pace over the remainder
of the forecast period, supported by continuing highly accommodative monetary policies
in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and a shallow recovery in South America.
The overall foreign outlook is slightly weaker in the current quarter and the next, relative
k
to the September Tealbook, as a result of softer data in some emerging market economies o
o
l
t
(EMEs) as well as markdowns in Canada and the United Kingdom. u
O
&
Given the mild pace of economic activity, inflation in most AFEs is expected to l
e
v
remain below central bank targets. The United Kingdom is a prominent exception, where e
D
the sharp depreciation of the pound has already begun to pass through into consumer n
o
c
prices and should push inflation well above the Bank of England’s (BOE’s) target in E
l
’
t
2017. More broadly, the recent rise in oil prices will boost AFE inflation in the current n
I
quarter and next. Thereafter, the whittling away of resource slack should keep AFE
inflation at just above 1½ percent for the remainder of the forecast period. In the EMEs,
inflation has also been lifted by higher energy prices, notably in Mexico, and by the
fading effects of previous declines in food prices in China. We expect EME inflation to
settle at around 3 percent.
With inflation low and growth subdued, we continue to assume that monetary
policy in the AFEs and some emerging Asian economies will remain highly
accommodative through 2019. Such stances have raised some concerns in AFEs about
the limits to asset purchases and the costs to financial sectors of very flat yield curves.
To address these concerns and in recognition of low inflation and inflation expectations,
the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a number of new policies at its September meeting,
including a target for 10-year government bond yields and its intention to overshoot its
2 percent inflation target. (For further details, see the box “The Bank of Japan’s New
Policy Framework” in this section of the Tealbook.)
Over the intermeeting period, we saw renewed focus on risks emanating from
Europe. First, harder negotiating stances taken by British and European officials on

The Bank of Japan’s New Policy Framework
At its September meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) introduced “Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary
Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control.” Under this new framework, the BOJ commits to overshooting its
inflation target by expanding the monetary base until total inflation exceeds 2 percent for some time. In
addition, the BOJ intends to control the yield curve by targeting short- and long-term interest rates. The
BOJ introduced a new target for the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) at “around zero
percent,” which it indicated could be adjusted at future policy meetings, and kept the deposit rate at
negative 0.1 percent. To facilitate yield curve control, the BOJ introduced two new tools: long-term
discount window credit for a period of up to 10 years and fixed-rate purchase operations that allow the
BOJ to buy unlimited amounts of JGBs at a specified rate. In addition, the BOJ removed its target for the
k average remaining maturity of its JGB purchases (which had been “about 7 to 12 years”), and Governor
o
o Kuroda indicated flexibility in the size of total future purchases. In its monthly purchase plan for October,
l
t
u the BOJ slightly reduced purchases of JGBs with maturities over 5 years while leaving unchanged
O
purchases of shorter-term JGBs. This shortening of average maturities and reduction in total purchases
&
l was likely an attempt to reduce downward pressure on the long end of the yield curve.
e
v
e
D
This new policy is the most recent of several adjustments to the BOJ’s monetary policy framework since
n
o Prime Minister Abe was elected in December 2012 with a promise to end deflation. Figure 1 shows that
c
E inflation expectations and actual inflation rose after the BOJ announced an inflation target of 2 percent in
l
t ’ January 2013 and initiated QQE in April 2013. However, inflation fell back, in part because of lower oil
n
I prices, and inflation expectations moved lower as well despite an expansion of asset purchases under
QQE in October 2014. The introduction of a negative policy rate in January 2016 contributed to a further
flattening of the yield curve, raising concerns that the reduced profitability of banks, insurance
companies, and pension funds could impair the transmission of monetary stimulus (figure 2).
The new framework has several potentially attractive features. First, it may allow the BOJ to keep long-
term yields very low with a smaller overall quantity of asset purchases and also to shift the composition
of its purchases toward shorter-maturity assets; these elements are desirable given ongoing concerns
that the scale of BOJ purchases may exhaust the supply of eligible long-maturity JGBs. Second, the yield
curve control may induce a somewhat more upward-sloping yielding curve while still delivering a
commensurate degree of economic stimulus and thus pose less risk to the health of the financial sector.
Third, the overshooting commitment may succeed in boosting inflation expectations through forward-
looking channels, which could help raise inflation directly (to the extent the Phillips curve depends on
inflation expectations) and indirectly through the stimulative effect of lower real interest rates
on activity.
The BOJ’s new framework also presents challenges. By targeting the 10-year bond yield, the BOJ is giving
up control over the size of its balance sheet. If there is sharp upward pressure on long-term yields—for
example, if market participants anticipate a change in the BOJ’s target rate—the BOJ could be forced to
purchase long-term JGBs at a much more rapid rate. In contrast, if the recent downward pressure on
10-year yields grows, the BOJ may have to slow purchases well below its current pace, in which case it will
need to communicate clearly so that this action is not misinterpreted as a removal of stimulus. Finally,
there is uncertainty over the BOJ’s commitment to overshooting its target and how long it will maintain
highly expansionary policy even as inflation rises.

Looking ahead, we expect the BOJ to return to a wait-and-see approach as it assesses the effect on
inflation expectations of the overshooting commitment and of dissipating temporary factors that have
held inflation down. As such, we see the BOJ keeping short-term interest rates at negative 0.1 percent for
the foreseeable future. We also expect the BOJ to maintain the 10-year JGB yield at 0 percent by shifting
its JGB purchases to shorter maturities and potentially slowing or quickening its total purchases, as
needed. Although we project that inflation will rise to only 1¼ percent during the forecast period, we
expect the BOJ to forgo substantial further easing and to instead maintain its current highly
accommodative stance and reiterate its aspirations for higher inflation.
All told, the market response has been minimal, consistent with little change in the stance of BOJ policy.
The yen has depreciated modestly, market-based inflation expectations have barely moved, and markets
expect only slight further cuts to the deposit rate. Although 10-year bond yields are little changed at
k
around negative 5 basis points, actual and implied volatility of 10-year yields have declined notably, o
o
suggesting some confidence in the BOJ’s ability to control long-term bond yields. The overall muted l
t
u
response of markets to the new framework may reflect skepticism over the BOJ’s ability to raise inflation O
in the absence of substantial new easing measures as well as doubts about the credibility of the BOJ’s &
commitment to overshoot its 2 percent inflation target. e l

Brexit point to rockier talks and, ultimately, less economic integration in any U.K.–EU
deal. As such, we have lowered the outlook for the United Kingdom slightly despite a
sharp depreciation of the pound. Second, attention has turned again to the low
profitability and poor capitalization of Europe’s banking sector, which increases the risk
of restraining the economic recovery and leaves institutions vulnerable to shocks. A
failure of a large and systemically important European bank could trigger financial
distress with pronounced international spillovers, a risk we explore in the “Banking Crisis
in Europe” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Other risks to the global economy that we have highlighted in the past also remain
k
o
o a source of concern. Although Chinese growth has been resilient, risks to financial
l
t
u stability remain significant. And, as discussed in the “Stronger Dollar and EME
O
& Turbulence” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section, U.S. monetary policy
l
e
v tightening could still prove destabilizing for EMEs, weighing on global growth and
e
D
leading to a more sizable appreciation of the dollar than in our baseline projection.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES

I
• United Kingdom. Recent indicators suggest that U.K. growth slowed from
2.7 percent in the second quarter to just above 1½ percent in the third quarter
amid signs of falling construction output. In recent weeks, U.K. and European
officials adopted more-confrontational stances regarding the future U.K.–EU
relationship. Of note, Prime Minister May suggested that restoring U.K.
sovereignty would be a higher priority than maintaining full access to the EU
single market. As a result, the likelihood of a “harder” Brexit—involving a
bumpier transition in the near term and less economic integration over the long
term—increased. The associated drag on growth will only be partly offset by the
weaker pound and slightly less contractionary fiscal policy. As a result, we
marked down the growth outlook a touch for most of the forecast period. Thus,
growth slows further to 1 percent in the fourth quarter before picking up to
1¾ percent by late 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a
depreciated currency, and a gradual resolution of uncertainty about the Brexit
process. The depreciation of the pound has led to a pickup in inflation, which we
expect to peak at 3½ percent in the current quarter. The BOE has said it will look
through this surge, and we assume it will keep its policy rate unchanged through
the forecast period and purchase a total of £70 billion in assets, as announced
in August.

• Euro Area. Data on industrial production through August and other more-recent
indicators suggest that real GDP growth remained near 1¼ percent in the third
quarter. Going forward, we continue to project that accommodative monetary
policy and slightly expansionary fiscal policy will support a gradual pickup in
growth. However, we also expect deep-seated weaknesses in the banking sector
and elevated anti-EU sentiment to trigger bouts of uncertainty and volatility,
which will likely weigh on the recovery. All told, we see GDP growth increasing
to 1¾ percent in 2017 and remaining near this pace through 2019. With inflation
lingering near 1½ percent throughout the forecast period, we believe that the
European Central Bank will continue to purchase assets through the end of
k
o
2017—beginning to taper a few months before that time—and will keep policy o
l
t
u
rates at their current levels until late 2019. O
&
l
• Canada. Monthly GDP for July and oil production through August suggest that e
v
e
real GDP grew 3½ percent in the third quarter after contracting 1.6 percent the D
n
quarter before. Going forward, however, survey indicators, such as September’s o
c
E
manufacturing PMI, point to a moderation in growth. Thus, we project GDP l
’
t
n
growth to average a bit more than 2 percent through mid-2017, supported by a I
weak Canadian dollar and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, before
settling at its potential pace of 1¾ percent by mid-2018. This projection is
slightly weaker than in the September Tealbook, as the government enacted new
macroprudential measures to cool an overheated housing market, including more
restrictive qualifications for mortgage insurance (for high loan-to-value, or LTV,
borrowers) and for portfolio insurance (for banks with low-LTV mortgages) as
well as the closure of a tax loophole for foreign buyers. Even so, with the output
gap gradually closing, we continue to anticipate that the Bank of Canada (BOC)
will begin increasing its policy rate in late 2017.
As part of its agreement with the government, reviewed every five years, to renew
its 2 percent inflation target for headline inflation, the BOC also replaced its
operational measure of core inflation with three new measures. These measures
are a trimmed mean, a “weighted median,” and a “common component” (derived
from a factor model), which are similar to the measures produced by the Dallas,
Cleveland, and New York Federal Reserve Banks, respectively. The BOC felt
that its old core measure was no longer an accurate measure of underlying
Page 41 of 96

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) October 26, 2016
inflation and thought it was more appropriate to look at several measures to gauge
inflationary pressures.
• Japan. As in the previous Tealbook, we estimate real GDP growth edged up to
1 percent in the third quarter as the economy recovered from the disruptions
caused by an earthquake in April. With the manufacturing PMI modestly
expansionary, we expect growth to slow to ¾ percent in the fourth quarter and to
remain near that pace over the next couple of years. As noted earlier, the BOJ
introduced a new policy framework at its September meeting. As explained
further in the box in this section of the Tealbook, our assessment is that this
k
o
o decision did not fundamentally alter the prospective path of monetary policy.
l
t
u We assume the BOJ will purchase assets and keep its policy rates at their current
O
& levels through the end of the forecast period. Inflation is projected to increase
l
e from negative ½ percent in the third quarter to ½ percent in 2017, reflecting
v
e
D
higher oil prices and a weaker yen, and to reach 1¼ percent by 2019. Our
n
o outlooks for both growth and inflation are little changed.

n EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
I
• China. Real GDP growth edged down to 6.8 percent in the third quarter, as we
expected, after expanding at a 7.1 percent rate in the second. In the face of rapid
credit growth and rising house prices, the authorities are increasingly focusing
less on macroeconomic stimulus and more on addressing financial stability
concerns. These concerns, which have been highlighted in recent speeches by
senior Chinese officials, have led to a coordinated introduction of
macroprudential policies to rein in credit and cool the housing market. The drag
from the external sector has diminished in recent quarters, and we expect the
depreciating RMB to support a positive contribution of net exports in the near
term. All told, we maintain our September Tealbook forecast of growth
continuing to moderate, in line with potential growth, to 5½ percent by the end of
2019. Falling food prices pushed down inflation to an estimated 1.4 percent in the
third quarter. We expect inflation to rebound as food prices normalize, settling at
around 2½ percent by early next year.
• Other Emerging Asia. Growth in the region is estimated to have slowed to
3 percent in the third quarter after rebounding to 3½ percent in the second. This
moderation partly reflects some expected payback for outsized second-quarter
Page 42 of 96

growth in Hong Kong. Additionally, indicators for activity in the third quarter
were weaker than expected, especially Singaporean GDP. In Korea, a temporary
labor strike and the ongoing corporate restructuring in the shipping industry
slowed down growth in the third quarter. All told, we expect the region’s growth
to remain near 3 percent in the current quarter before edging up to a near-trend
pace of 3½ percent by mid-2017. Relative to the September Tealbook projection,
this outlook is down ½ percentage point in the near term and ¼ percentage point
thereafter.
• Mexico. We estimate that Mexican real GDP growth increased to 2¼ percent in
k
the third quarter, in line with the rebound in U.S. manufacturing production, from o
o
l
t
a disappointing ¾ percent decline in GDP in the second. Exports picked up u
O
through August, and PMIs increased through September. Household demand also &
l
firmed in the three months ending in July amid rapid credit growth and improving e
v
e
labor market conditions. We see growth moving up to 2¾ percent by the end of D
n
the forecast period, with the effects of the peso’s depreciation—which is about o
c
E
30 percent lower in real effective terms since mid-2014—and energy-sector
l
’
t
n
reforms more than offsetting a substantial fiscal drag. Headline inflation jumped I
to 3.8 percent in the third quarter from about 2 percent in the second, reflecting, in
part, the pass-through from the peso depreciation and increases in gasoline prices.
In late September, the Bank of Mexico hiked its policy rate 50 basis points to
4.75 percent, citing concerns that currency depreciation would fuel inflationary
pressures.
• Brazil. Brazil’s recession appears to have deepened more than we expected, and
we have increased the pace of contraction of real GDP in the third quarter to
2 percent. Monthly GDP, industrial production, and retail sales all declined
through August amid rising unemployment and still-low consumer confidence.
We now see the economy bottoming out in the fourth quarter rather than in the
third, with a slow recovery thereafter led by rising investment on the back of
improving business confidence. However, tight fiscal and monetary policies will
continue to weigh on activity. The central bank lowered its rate 25 basis points to
14 percent amid signs that inflationary pressures are abating; however, we expect
further policy rate cuts to be very gradual. Headline inflation declined to
8½ percent (on a 12-month basis) in September from double-digit levels earlier
this year and should fall further to 4½ percent by 2019.

Financial Developments
Domestic financial markets have been relatively calm since the September FOMC
meeting. U.S. economic data releases and Federal Reserve communications were
generally interpreted as in line with market expectations, and foreign macroeconomic
data continue to support expectations of modest growth. Based on a straight read of
market quotes, the implied probability of an increase in the target range of the federal
funds rate before the end of the year rose modestly to about 70 percent. The nominal
Treasury yield curve moved up a touch on net.
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities edged up, on net, by
6, 8, and 7 basis points, respectively.
 Five-year TIPS-based inflation compensation rose 24 basis points, and the
five-year, five-year-forward measure moved up 16 basis points.
 The federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of market quotes
steepened slightly on balance.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
Domestic U.S. economic data releases were generally interpreted as in line with
market expectations. While the September employment report was reportedly slightly
below expectations, it was generally not considered weak, and some other data releases
during the period—in particular, the September ISM surveys—were viewed as above
expectations. Communications immediately following the September meeting, notably
the Summary of Economic Projections, were interpreted as slightly more accommodative
than expected, while later Federal Reserve communications were seen as in line with
expectations.
The expected path of policy appeared to steepen slightly, on net, over the
intermeeting period. Based on a straight read of market quotes, the implied probability of
an increase in the target range of the federal funds rate before the end of the year rose
modestly to about 70 percent. Respondents to the Desk’s November surveys of primary
dealers and market participants assigned a probability of about 60 percent to a rate hike
by the end of this year. The most likely path of the target federal funds rate in 2017 and
2018 was little changed for the median respondent relative to the September survey.
Both primary dealers and investors generally do not expect a rate hike to occur at the
November meeting. s

low immediately following the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote in June. Measures of

inflation compensation based on inflation swaps increased by similar amounts. The
recent increase in far-forward inflation compensation appears attributable to a
combination of factors, including the recent rise in oil prices and a decline in investors’
concerns about the risk of very low inflation outcomes, as implied by quotes on inflation
caps and floors.
The S&P 500 stock price index was little changed, on net, since the September
FOMC meeting. Energy was among the best-performing sectors over the period,
consistent with rising oil prices. Stock prices of sectors that benefit from low interest
rates, such as real estate and utilities, underperformed the broader market. Realized and
implied volatilities in equity markets remained relatively low.
Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields on nonfinancial investment- and
speculative-grade corporate bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities
declined a bit, with both spreads now standing around their median levels during
economic expansions over the past two decades. The narrowing in credit spreads mainly
reflected tightening in spreads for bonds issued by firms in the energy sector.
Foreign Developments
Since the September FOMC meeting, foreign macroeconomic data came in
generally in line with market expectations. Foreign equity indexes moved moderately s
t
n
higher, while credit spreads were little changed. That said, markets were occasionally e
m
affected by news about the upcoming negotiations between the United Kingdom and the p
o
l
e
EU surrounding the U.K. exit and by continued concerns about the European banking v
e
D
sector, particularly Deutsche Bank. Although market sentiment toward the European
l
a
banks improved over the period, significant risks remain. c i
n
a
n
i
In the United Kingdom, the pound depreciated by roughly 6 percent, and 10-year F
gilt yields increased along with inflation compensation. These moves were driven by
indications that a tougher negotiating stance would be taken by British and European
officials, increasing the odds of a U.K.–EU deal with much less economic integration
than at present, a so-called hard Brexit; the rise in yields may also have reflected Prime
Minister May’s remarks on the side effects of quantitative easing and the greater
possibility of near-term U.K. fiscal expansion. In the other advanced foreign economies
(AFEs), interest rates were little changed, on net, having declined early in the period
following the FOMC meeting but later recovering as rising oil prices boosted the

inflation outlook. The ECB left its policy rates unchanged at its October meeting but
acknowledged that an abrupt end to asset purchases is unlikely, and it signaled that
further changes to the asset purchase program could be announced at its December
meeting. At its September 21 meeting, the Bank of Japan announced that it would seek
to stabilize the 10-year yield around zero percent, and that it would seek to conduct
policy so as to push inflation above the 2 percent inflation target. Japanese sovereign
yields were little changed, on net, but measures of implied volatility for longer-term
interest rates declined.
In addition to the sharp move against the pound, the dollar also appreciated by
2 to 3 percent against most other AFE currencies. Although these moves were in line
with a relative increase in U.S. policy expectations, the magnitude of the change in
exchange rates was somewhat outsized. In contrast, the dollar fell against many
commodity currencies, including the Mexican peso and Russian ruble. On balance, the
broad index of the dollar rose ½ percent over the period.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS, FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS, AND
BANKING-SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS
The compliance deadline for the recent MMF reforms was October 14.2 In the
weeks leading up to the deadline, institutional prime MMFs continued to experience
s
t
significant outflows, while government MMFs attracted similarly sized inflows. n
e
m
However, these flows slowed significantly in the days just prior to the compliance day
p
o
and have since remained subdued (see the box “The Effect of Money Market Fund e l
v
e
Reform over the Past Year” for a longer-term retrospective). D
l
a
i
c
The outflows from institutional prime funds continued, on balance, to lead to n
a
n
lower overall outstanding amounts of commercial paper, negotiable certificates of i
F
deposit, and large time deposits overall during the intermeeting period. While
government funds appear to be the largest recipients of the outflows from prime funds,
core deposits at banks also increased.
Measures of the liquidity of institutional prime funds, which had increased
substantially ahead of the compliance deadline, have since declined. In particular, the

institutional prime funds and tax-exempt funds to trade shares at floating net asset values and by allowing
nongovernment funds to impose liquidity and redemption fees.

The Effect of Money Market Fund Reform over the Past Year
As a direct result of recent money market fund (MMF) reforms, the MMF industry
has seen a transfer of more than $1 trillion from prime funds to government
funds and other entities over the past year, while total MMF assets under
management (AUM) have declined only slightly.1 Overall, the transition has been
smooth with no market stresses, as market participants were able to efficiently
absorb the flow of cash. This analysis provides additional details regarding
changes in MMF holdings. It also discusses related changes in the funding costs
and structure of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBOs) over the
past year.
Prime funds responded to the significant decline in their AUM by reducing
holdings of all major asset classes. As shown in figure 1, negotiable certificates of
deposit (CDs) and unsecured commercial paper (CP) fell $340 billion and
$212 billion, respectively, over the past year. These reductions were coincident
with a rise in rates on CD and CP with maturities over 30 days.
Prime funds also substantially reduced their lending in the Eurodollar market
(included in the “other instruments” category in figure 1). Figure 2 highlights
that FBOs are the main borrowers of Eurodollars from prime funds; their
borrowing dropped $120 billion, as MMFs reduced their supply in the Eurodollar
market compared with a year ago.2 Over this period, rates in the Eurodollar
market have crept up marginally.
s
t
n
Government funds responded to the significant increase in their AUM by
e
m
expanding holdings of all eligible assets, as shown in figure 3. In particular, their
p
o holdings of agency debt have more than doubled, and holdings of Treasury bills
l
e
v have risen $274 billion. Still, rates on these instruments have traded at their usual
e
D spreads to the IOER (interest on excess reserves) rate, as Treasury bill issuance
l
a has increased significantly. Government fund holdings of agency repos and
i
c
n Treasury repos are also higher. Finally, in recent weeks, daily take-up by
a
n government funds at the ON RRP (overnight reverse repurchase agreement
i
F
facility) has been moderately elevated compared with typical 2016 levels,
perhaps reflecting the large inflow of cash that has not yet been invested in
higher-yielding money market instruments.
1 Detailed MMF data are through September 30, 2016, as the data are only available with a
monthly lag. Prime funds saw an additional $288 billion of outflows through October 14, 2016.
2 As lending by non-MMF entities remained steady in both the Eurodollar and federal
funds markets, this observation suggests that the reduced volumes in the Eurodollar market
were the result of less supply from prime funds rather than less demand from FBOs. Lenders
in the federal funds market are primarily federal home loan banks that were not affected by
the MMF reform. Thus, there was no supply shock in this market.

Collectively, FBOs experienced significant shifts in funding costs and liabilities as
a result of MMF reform. Higher longer-term CD and financial CP rates increased
FBO funding costs. In addition, outstanding large time deposits at FBOs
decreased $172 billion and financial CP issuance slowed considerably. And, as
mentioned previously, FBOs borrowed fewer funds in the Eurodollar market.
Reflecting, in part, these contractions in liabilities, FBO reserve balances dropped
roughly $360 billion over the past year (figure 4).3

weighted-average maturity of prime fund assets jumped from a low of 11 days prior to
October 14 to 25 days, although this level remains below its average of about 40 days in
recent years. As a share of prime funds’ total assets, liquid assets also moved notably
lower. The average net yield for such funds has risen sharply, driven in part by lower
account fees and the reduced liquidity levels.
Looking more broadly at money markets, the effective federal funds rate and
Eurodollar rate continued to average about 40 basis points over the intermeeting period,
while the overnight triparty repo rate for Treasury collateral stayed above the ON RRP
offer rate of 25 basis points. Four-week Treasury bill yields declined to a low of 9 basis
points, likely a result of the inflows to government funds that sought to invest additional
cash in shorter-term Treasury securities. More recently, however, the four-week bill
yield has returned to levels more in line with other money market interest rates.
Some of the rise in the total assets of government funds over the intermeeting
period appeared to contribute to a moderately elevated ON RRP take-up of about
$177 billion, on average, excluding September quarter-end.3 Take-up reached
$413 billion on quarter-end and fell a bit more slowly than after previous quarter-ends.
Eurodollar volumes fell substantially in the weeks preceding the MMF reform
compliance deadline and have remained at this lower level as prime money funds pulled
back from lending in this market. Despite these volume changes, there has been little s

to the October SLOOS indicated that, on net, standards and demand for C&I loans
remained unchanged in the third quarter.
Equity issuance was robust in September, with mature corporations issuing equity
through seasoned offerings at a somewhat faster pace than that observed over the past
few years and issuance through initial public offerings picking up from August’s low
level.
About 25 percent of firms in the S&P 500 index have reported third-quarter
earnings. Based on these reports and estimates implied from Wall Street analyst forecasts
for the rest of the firms in the index, earnings per share appear to have continued to
rebound in the third quarter and are now projected to come in a bit higher than year-
earlier levels. The rebound in earnings appears to reflect improvements across a wide
range of industries, including the energy sector. Year-ahead earnings projections by Wall
Street analysts for S&P 500 companies were revised little, on balance, over the
intermeeting period.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations, which had deteriorated some over
the past few quarters, showed signs of stabilization. The volume of corporate bond
upgrades was only slightly outpaced by that of downgrades in September. Both the six-
month trailing bond default rate and the KMV expected year-ahead default measure

signs of deteriorations in the credit quality of state and local governments. F i
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) also remained largely
accommodative but have shown some signs of tightening. CMBS issuance in the third
quarter picked up relative to its pace in the first half of the year, and spreads on CMBS
were little changed over the intermeeting period. Growth in CRE loans on banks’ books
continued to be strong in the third quarter. However, significant numbers of banks again
reported in the October SLOOS that they had tightened lending standards on CRE loans
(see the box “Banks’ Commercial Real Estate Lending Standards and Loan Growth” for a
discussion of this trend).

Banks’ Commercial Real Estate Lending Standards and Loan Growth
Commercial banks indicated in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
Lending Practices (SLOOS) that they had tightened their lending standards across all major
categories of commercial real estate (CRE) loans during the third quarter on net (black line in
figure 1). This quarter is the fourth consecutive one in which survey respondents have
indicated a tightening of their CRE lending standards following several years of reported
easing. At the same time, growth of banks’ CRE loans has continued at a robust pace
(figure 2). Here we examine the question of whether the recent tightening of banks’ CRE
lending standards will eventually translate to lower aggregate CRE loan growth at banks.
The answer depends importantly on two factors: the evolution of the demand for CRE loans
(as measured by the red line in figure 1) and the size of the banks that engaged in tightening
their CRE lending standards.
First, we find in both aggregate and bank-level regressions that banks’ assessments of their
lending standards and loan demand, as reported in the SLOOS, are each significant
predictors of future loan growth.1 While the third-quarter SLOOS results displayed in figure 1
suggest that demand for CRE loans remained unchanged and that banks, on net, tightened
their CRE lending standards, we should expect, based on the statistical relationships among
these data series, to see continued CRE loan growth at banks over the next several quarters.
Second, we consider how bank size may affect a translation from survey-based tightening of
CRE lending standards to lower aggregate CRE loan growth. Unlike commercial and
industrial lending, in which the majority of loans that are made and held on banks’ balance
s sheets are held by large banks, the majority of CRE loans that are made and held directly

1 In particular, lagged net tightening and net demand SLOOS measures partially explain aggregate
movements in outstanding loans at banks. Bank-level regressions show that individual banks’ responses to
standards and demand questions in the SLOOS are also predictive of growth in CRE loan originations.

on banks’ balance sheets are held by smaller banks (defined as those outside the top 25
domestic banks by total assets). In addition, while the SLOOS surveys up to 80 domestic
commercial banks each quarter, large banks are disproportionately represented in the
survey panel.2 Thus, the net tightening in CRE lending standards observed in the SLOOS
panel of banks may be more reflective of changes in standards at large banks than at smaller
banks. In this case, the growth in banks’ aggregate CRE loans may not slow as quickly in the
wake of a tightening in CRE lending standards—as reported in the SLOOS—as the growth in
large banks’ CRE loans.
Indeed, as shown in the table below, thus far in 2016, large banks have disproportionately
reported tightening their CRE lending standards on all three major categories of CRE loans
relative to small banks, on average, and have also reportedly experienced relatively weaker
demand for such loans. Two interesting questions, which we do not explore here, are the
following: (1) What factors caused large banks to disproportionately tighten CRE lending
standards relative to smaller banks so far in 2016? and (2) What factors are continuing to
drive stronger loan demand at smaller banks?
The reportedly more widespread tightening in CRE lending standards at large banks in 2016
has, in fact, been accompanied by a gradual slowing in loan growth at such banks over this
same period, as can be seen by the blue portion of the bars in figure 2. In contrast, CRE loan
growth at smaller banks, as measured by the red portion of the bars in figure 2, has
remained brisk.
In sum, the reported tightening of CRE lending standards by banks in the SLOOS over the
past several quarters and the continued strong aggregate growth in CRE loans at banks are
s
consistent with continued reports of strengthening demand for CRE loans at smaller banks t
n
and lower net fractions of small banks reporting tightening of their CRE lending standards e
m
compared with large banks so far this year. p

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed and
remained accommodative on balance. Consumer loan balances increased at a year-over-
year rate of about 6.7 percent through August, reflecting steady growth in both revolving
and nonrevolving consumer credit. However, credit card lending standards remained
tight for subprime consumers. Indeed, respondents to the October SLOOS indicated that
they became less likely over the past quarter to approve credit cards for borrowers with
below-prime credit scores. In contrast, auto credit remained broadly available to
subprime consumers.
Consumer credit quality has largely been stable. Delinquencies of credit card
loans in securitized pools changed little in August and remained near historical lows.
Auto loan delinquencies have crept upward.
ABS spreads for credit card and auto loans, which have been narrowing off and
on since late March, were little changed, on balance, in recent weeks. ABS issuance
picked up somewhat in the third quarter from the levels seen earlier this year.
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over
the intermeeting period and remained accommodative. Interest rates on 30-year fixed
s mortgages edged up but remained at a low level of about 3.3 percent. Several large banks

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the
benchmark used by the FOMC). We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, importantly because both monetary and fiscal
policy appear to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial
adverse ones. Foreign developments and prospects also pose downside risks to the U.S.
economy. For example, the Chinese economy continues to face the possibility of a hard
landing, many corporations in emerging market economies (EMEs) are highly leveraged
and sensitive to global financial conditions, and Europe remains rife with political and
economic risk. Moreover, in the event of an economic downturn, foreign authorities
would likely face similar constraints in providing policy stimulus as in the United States.
We view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for
GDP and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.
With regard to inflation, we do not view the current level of uncertainty as
unusually high. We see important risks to inflation on both the upside and the downside,
and we view those risks as roughly balanced—a change from previous Tealbooks, when
we viewed the risks as weighted somewhat to the downside. Some survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are near historically low levels, and the
realization of the downside risks to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the
foreign exchange value of the dollar, thereby depressing U.S. import prices and inflation.
However, this year’s inflation data have been somewhat firmer than we had expected,
suggesting that upside risks may be greater than we had previously thought. One such
risk is the possibility that, with the economy projected to be operating above its long-run
potential, inflation may increase more than the staff expects, consistent with the
predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.

money market fund reform has reduced the risk of investor runs on such funds. Although
leverage in the corporate sector is elevated, the pace of borrowing by the private
nonfinancial sector as a whole remains moderate. Notably, borrowing by households
remains far below levels experienced late in the previous decade. Valuations across a
range of asset markets appear moderate, albeit only when evaluated relative to Treasury
yields. As a result, the possibility that long-term interest rates could rise more rapidly
than expected poses a downside risk to prices of a wide range of risky assets. Finally, the
European banking sector remains weak, and an intensification of strains, particularly at a
large institution, could lead to disruptions and a tightening in financial conditions abroad
with significant implications for the U.S. economic outlook.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct several alternatives to
the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first two scenarios explore
possible risks to the forecast from a tight labor market. In the first scenario, running the
economy “hot” for a while leads to persistent positive effects on the productive capacity
of the economy. By contrast, in the second scenario, the tight labor market results in
inflation notably above the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. The third scenario illustrates
the effects of a more positive outlook for consumer confidence and household spending
than in the baseline. In the fourth scenario, aggregate demand is persistently weaker,
consistent with a substantially lower long-run equilibrium real interest rate. The fifth
scenario considers the effect of a banking crisis in Europe, and the sixth and final
scenario analyzes the case where U.S. policy normalization leads to a much stronger
appreciation of the dollar and financial turbulence in the EMEs.
The first, second, and fourth scenarios are simulated in the FRB/US model, while
the third scenario uses the EDO model. The fifth and sixth scenarios are run in the
multicountry SIGMA model. In all of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by
the same inertial policy rule as in the baseline, including the adjustments to the intercept
in the near term. In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA
y
portfolio follow the baseline paths. n t

tightness may have persistent positive effects on the productive capacity of the
economy—a phenomenon referred to as “positive hysteresis.” In this scenario, we
assume that by running the economy hot for a while, exits from the labor force are held
down and additional workers are drawn into the labor force, resulting in an increase in the
trend labor force participation rate that accumulates to 1 percentage point above the
baseline by the end of 2021. Furthermore, we assume that the experience workers gain
through greater employment reduces the natural rate of unemployment ½ percentage
point below the baseline by the end of 2021.1
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ½ percentage point more
per year over the projection period than in the baseline. This additional room to grow
allows real GDP to also increase about ½ percentage point per year more than in the
baseline. As a result, the output gap is about unchanged. The unemployment rate
follows a lower trajectory and is almost ½ percentage point below the baseline by 2021.
With inflation and the output gap roughly at the baseline, the federal funds rate is little
changed.2
Higher Labor Costs
In the Tealbook projection, the extended period of undershooting of the natural
rate of unemployment is not projected to result in substantial inflationary pressure,
consistent with the subdued response of prices to economic activity seen in recent years.
However, it is possible that inflation will rise more than we have assumed in the baseline,
which could happen if wages prove more sensitive to a tight labor market than to a slack
market. Furthermore, the projected improvements in the labor market might be
accompanied by continued weak productivity growth if those workers who find jobs in a
hot labor market are relatively less productive than those who find jobs in more normal
conditions.
This scenario considers the possibility that labor costs grow at a faster rate than in
the baseline as labor market conditions tighten further in the medium term. In particular,
y

n
2 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential U
output, the federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching almost
&
3¾ percent at the end of 2021. In that case, real GDP growth would be ¼ percentage point lower, on
s
average, between 2019 and 2021 than in this scenario, with the unemployment rate ¼ percentage point k
s
i
above this scenario at the end of 2021. Inflation would still remain close to the baseline. R

we assume that hourly labor compensation rises ½ percentage point per year faster during
the projection period. We also assume that the pickup in labor productivity growth
projected by the staff between 2017 and 2018 is not realized, and growth remains at the
same subdued pace seen in recent years.
In the FRB/US model, the resulting higher labor costs pass through to prices, and
PCE price inflation reaches 2.6 percent by 2021. Real GDP rises about 1½ percent, on
average, from 2017 through 2019, compared with 2 percent in the baseline projection,
because of the weaker path of labor productivity. As a result of higher inflation, the
federal funds rate rises more steeply, reaching 3¾ percent at the end of 2021. The
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher than the baseline, on average, between
2019 and 2021.
Brighter Expectations
Although many indicators of investment and production have recently been weak,
the labor market has continued to improve. Moreover, consumer confidence has
remained upbeat, and there are signs of wage acceleration, which could support
households’ income expectations and further boost consumer confidence.
In this scenario, we assume that these conditions lead to a further improvement in
the sentiment of firms and households, boosting consumer spending growth and spurring
additional business investment.3 As a result, real GDP rises 2¾ percent per year, on
average, in 2017 and 2018, compared with 2 percent in the baseline projection. The
unemployment rate falls steeply, bottoming out at a touch above 3¾ percent by the end of
2018; it then edges up over the remainder of the forecast period but stays lower than in
the baseline. With resource utilization running tight, inflation is a little higher than in the
baseline, reaching 2 percent by the end of 2019. The federal funds rate rises more
steeply, reaching 4 percent at the beginning of 2020.
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate
Aggregate demand has been weak during the recent recovery, reflecting both
y
n t domestic and global factors. In the baseline, these factors are expected to dissipate,
i
a
r t causing the equilibrium real federal funds rate to rise over time. However, some
e
c

Accordingly, this scenario assumes persistently weaker domestic aggregate demand over
the next decade than in the baseline, consistent with a long-run equilibrium real federal
funds rate of zero.4 We assume that policymakers only gradually recognize the lower
trajectory of the equilibrium interest rate over the projection period.
In the longer run, monetary policy fully responds to the lower equilibrium real
federal funds rate. By 2021, the federal funds rate is almost 1 percentage point lower
than in the baseline and the unemployment rate has nearly returned to the baseline. In the
short run, however, the federal funds rate does not fall enough to fully offset the weaker
aggregate demand both because the policy rule is very inertial and because policymakers
are assumed to recognize the lower long-run equilibrium interest rate only gradually. As
a result, output expands more slowly than in the baseline, and the path for the
unemployment rate is slightly higher. Real GDP growth through 2017 and 2018 is
¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline projection; the unemployment rate is about
¼ percentage point higher in 2017 and 2018. With resource utilization only slightly
weaker, inflation remains close to the baseline.5
Banking Crisis in Europe
Europe’s banking sector has many underlying vulnerabilities, including tepid
earnings prospects, weak capital positions, and a high level of nonperforming loans.
Accordingly, we think there is some chance that a major European bank will experience a
severe deterioration in its liquidity and capital conditions, requiring the bank to be
resolved and restructured. Although it is possible that this scenario could have relatively
muted spillovers, the resolution of a systemically important European bank could
precipitate a loss in confidence in Europe’s banking system more generally and in the
authorities’ abilities to address these problems. In this scenario, we consider the
possibility that a resolution of a major European bank leads to a banking crisis that
produces sizable adverse financial spillovers to both the United States and the rest of
the world.

Specifically, this scenario assumes that financial conditions in Europe tighten
significantly and that household and business confidence decline amid rising
unemployment and heightened disinflationary pressures. European corporate borrowing
spreads rise over 100 basis points, and household borrowing spreads also rise noticeably.
With little scope for the ECB to reduce long-term sovereign yields, Europe falls into a
recession, with GDP bottoming out at about 4 percent below the baseline by the end of
2018. The crisis has adverse spillovers to the United States: U.S. corporate bond spreads
rise about 50 basis points, while flight-to-safety flows cause the trade-weighted dollar to
appreciate 5 percent. Financial conditions tighten even more in the EMEs, and their
currencies depreciate substantially.
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall
relative to the baseline. U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the baseline as a
result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions. All told, U.S. real GDP only
grows about 1½ percent in 2017 and 2018. The U.S. unemployment rate runs at about
5 percent in 2017 and 2018, ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline. Lower
resource utilization and falling import prices reduce U.S. core inflation to slightly above
1 percent by 2017. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path, reaching only
1½ percent at the end of 2018, compared with about 2½ percent in the baseline.
Stronger Dollar and EME Turbulence
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate about 5 percent over the
forecast period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster than markets currently
appear to expect. However, ongoing U.S. policy normalization could well cause a much
larger and more persistent appreciation of the dollar, especially if higher U.S. interest
rates generate financial turbulence in vulnerable EMEs. In this scenario, we assume that
the broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the end of next year above its
baseline path and that EME corporate borrowing spreads rise substantially—about
100 basis points—in the face of persistent capital outflows from EMEs.6 All told, foreign
GDP growth runs about ¾ percentage point below the baseline in 2017, notwithstanding
the sizable depreciation of foreign currencies.

Appendix
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for
1998 through 2014 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further
back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the
prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast means that yyyy

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
