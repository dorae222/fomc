Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
On balance, the data on real activity and spending that we have received since the D
n
October Tealbook have come in a little better than expected, supporting our view that a o
c
E
modest economic recovery is continuing. Despite a disappointing employment report for
c
i
t
November, the full range of labor market data received since the October projection s
e
m
suggests that labor demand is improving at a slightly faster rate than we were anticipating o
D
in our previous forecast. Moreover, the latest indicators of factory output and business
spending point to a stronger pace of production and investment over the second half of
this year than we were previously projecting. Real consumer spending has also surprised
us to the upside and appears to be on a somewhat firmer footing given recent upward
revisions to the level of personal income. In contrast, incoming news on the housing
market has once again come in below our expectations. On net, we expect that real GDP
will rise at an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the second half of this year,
½ percentage point faster than our October Tealbook forecast.
In this forecast, we have revised our assumptions for fiscal policy to reflect the
recent budget negotiations; this revision adds roughly ½ percentage point to real GDP
growth in 2011 and deducts a somewhat smaller amount in 2012. In addition, the path of
equity prices is somewhat higher in this forecast. However, relative to the October
projection, the other conditioning assumptions are somewhat less favorable, with a
slightly higher foreign exchange value of the dollar through next year, higher long-term
interest rates, and an appreciably lower assumed path for house prices. The revision to
house prices is part of a broader rethinking on our part of the outlook for the housing
market, which, in light of the persistently weak readings for this sector since midyear, we
now see as improving much less rapidly than we had previously projected. Putting all of
this together and factoring in the effect of the stronger incoming data, we now expect real
GDP growth of 3¾ percent in 2011 and 4½ percent in 2012, with the level of real GDP at
the end of 2012 about unchanged from our October forecast. With this trajectory for real
GDP, the unemployment rate declines to just under 9 percent by the end of next year and
to 8 percent by the end of 2012.
Our projection for inflation is slightly below that in the previous Tealbook.
Recent data on core consumer prices have come in somewhat lower than expected; while
we think that these lower readings mostly reflect transitory factors, we also see them as

u t suggesting a slightly lower pace of underlying inflation. We project that core PCE prices
O
will rise 0.9 percent in both 2011 and 2012, 0.1 percentage point lower in each year than
&
e l in our October forecast. We expect headline price inflation to edge down from
v
e
D 1.2 percent in 2010 to 1.1 percent in 2011 and to 0.9 percent in 2012, as energy prices
n
o decelerate.

D Monetary Policy
We assume that the FOMC will hold the target federal funds rate in the current
range of 0 to ¼ percent until the first quarter of 2013, one quarter longer than was
assumed in the October Tealbook. Regarding nonconventional policy, we continue to
assume that the Federal Reserve will expand its holdings of Treasury securities by
purchasing an average of $75 billion per month through the second quarter of 2011,
bringing the securities holdings in the SOMA portfolio to $2.6 trillion. In addition, we
assume that the Federal Reserve will reinvest principal payments from its securities
holdings through early 2013.
Financial Conditions
Since the October Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased about
50 basis points. That rise likely reflected a downward revision by market participants of
the expected size of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, incoming economic data that
were viewed as favorable on balance, and recent fiscal policy developments. At the time
of the October Tealbook, we believed that investors had priced into Treasury yields a
larger expansion of the balance sheet than the FOMC would adopt; we therefore thought
that the scaling back of expectations for the program’s size would put additional upward
pressure on yields in coming months. However, it now appears that this process played
out much more rapidly than we were anticipating. As a result, we have marked up the
path of the 10-year Treasury yield, but by more in the near term than in the medium term.
As has been true for some time, we expect that yields will rise further over the next two
years, mainly reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the
projected period of near-zero short-term interest rates.
Since late October, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds and interest rates
on conforming fixed-rate mortgages have increased about in line with Treasury yields,
leaving their implied risk spreads little changed. We therefore left our forecasts for those

v
e
D
n The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is about 3 percent above the level
o
c
E anticipated in the October Tealbook, and favorable news about the economy appears to
c
i
t have pushed the implied equity risk premium down a touch. Nevertheless, the equity
s
e
m
premium remains well above longer-run norms. We expect stock prices to increase at an
o
D
annual rate of about 11 percent over the next two years as the recovery proceeds and
financial market participants gradually become less concerned about risk, thereby causing
the implied equity premium to fall back toward a more typical level.
Readings on home prices have been weaker than we expected in the October
Tealbook, and as part of our more downbeat assessment of the state of the housing
market, we have marked down the projected path of home prices over the medium term.
In particular, we now expect these prices to decrease 5¾ percent this year and 2¾ percent
in 2011, then to level off in 2012. As a result, the projected level of home prices at the
end of 2012 is nearly 8 percent below the level in the October Tealbook forecast.
Fiscal Policy
Our assumptions about federal fiscal policy have changed from the October
Tealbook to reflect the major components of the compromise agreement between the
President and congressional Republicans. In particular, our forecast now includes a
temporary reduction in employee payroll taxes equal to 2 percent of taxable wages in
2011 and a provision that allows businesses to fully expense their qualified investment
spending next year. Regarding other elements of the agreement, we had already been
assuming that all of the provisions of the 2001–03 tax cuts—including those for high-
income individuals—would be extended through 2012, and that the Emergency
Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program would be extended through 2011. We
also now assume a pay freeze for civilian federal employees in 2011 and 2012. All told,
we now project that total discretionary federal fiscal policy actions will have roughly a
neutral effect on aggregate demand in 2011 but will impose a drag of about 1 percent on
real GDP in 2012 as the effects of stimulus policies wane.
Our new policy assumptions imply a forecast for the unified budget deficit that is
a little larger than the October projection. The budget deficit for fiscal year 2010 was
Page 4 of 100

--- Page 8 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
k
o
o
l
$1.3 trillion (around 9 percent of GDP), and we expect it to tick up to $1.4 trillion in u t
O
fiscal 2011. The budget deficit is anticipated to narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012
&
(around 7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the further winding down of stimulus- e l
v
e
related policies and the higher revenues associated with a faster pace of economic D
n
activity. o

Foreign Activity and the Dollar t
s
e
m
Following a significant slowing in the third quarter, we expect foreign real GDP
o
D
growth to increase to an annual rate of about 2¾ percent in the current quarter. Over the
next two years, we project foreign output to accelerate a bit further, with real GDP
expanding 3½ percent in 2012. This outlook is little changed from our October
projection. In reaction to the renewed financial stresses in Europe, we have marked down
our forecast for economic activity in the peripheral euro-area countries. This downward
revision, however, has been largely offset by a more buoyant outlook for Germany,
where strong incoming data and the stimulative effects of euro depreciation point to
continued resilience.
Since the October Tealbook, the dollar has appreciated about ¾ percent on a real,
trade-weighted basis against a broad set of currencies. In 2011 and 2012, we expect the
real dollar to depreciate about 3 percent per year on average, a slightly faster pace than
we assumed in the previous Tealbook. This higher rate of depreciation reflects two
adjustments to our outlook. First, the anticipated market disappointment we had built
into the October forecast regarding the scale of the FOMC’s asset purchases appears to
have already occurred; this development removes a factor that slowed the projected pace
of dollar depreciation in the previous projection. Second, we now assume that with the
exception of China, governments in emerging Asia will allow their currencies to
appreciate at slightly faster rates going forward. Relative to the October Tealbook, the
incoming data and these adjustments leave the path of the broad real dollar a little higher
through the end of 2011; thereafter, the faster rate of depreciation pushes the dollar’s
exchange value slightly below our previous assumption.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
Oil prices climbed sharply following the November FOMC announcement, but
then fell back on concerns over financial stress in Europe and tighter monetary policy in
China. More recently, incoming data pointing to stronger-than-expected global
manufacturing activity have pushed near-term prices higher. On net, the spot price of
Page 5 of 100

--- Page 9 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
k
o
o
l
u t West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil has moved up about $6.50 per barrel since the
O
October Tealbook, closing most recently on December 7 at $88.69 per barrel. With a
&
e l much flatter futures curve, we now project the spot price of WTI to change little over the
v
e
D forecast period, ending 2012 at about $90 per barrel—up $1.50 from our previous
n
o forecast.
c
E
c
i
t Since the October Tealbook, nonfuel commodity prices have moved up modestly,
s
e
m
with metals prices, like oil prices, responding to prospects for global activity, and with
o
D
prices for food and other agricultural commodities up on largely idiosyncratic supply
developments. We project that nonfuel commodity prices will show an increase of
9½ percent (not at an annual rate) in the current quarter; most of this increase reflects
price movements seen prior to the October Tealbook, and this rise is only about
2 percentage points above our October forecast. Consistent with quotes from futures
markets, we project that nonfuel commodity prices will edge higher during the first half
of 2011 before declining slightly in the second half and throughout 2012.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
On balance, the data on real activity and spending that we have received since the
October Tealbook have come in somewhat stronger than expected. We now project that
real GDP will increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second half of this year,
½ percentage point above our October forecast. In addition, the forecast now shows real
GDP rising at a 3½ percent pace in the first quarter of 2011, ¾ percentage point above the
October projection.
Labor Markets
Since the October Tealbook, we received both a stronger-than-expected labor
market report for October and a weaker-than-expected report for November. On net,
private nonfarm employers added an average of 105,000 jobs per month in October and
November; together with upward revisions to earlier months, these job gains left the
November level of private payroll employment more than 130,000 above our forecast in
the October Tealbook. Reflecting the ongoing tepid pace of hiring, the unemployment
rate rose to 9.8 percent in November after having held steady at 9.6 percent over the
preceding three months.
Other indicators of labor market activity point to a further gradual pickup in
employment growth in coming months. Layoff indicators, such as initial claims for

The Industrial Sector
o
D
Although industrial production (IP) was flat in October and has changed little, on
net, since July, these readings were held down by weather-related declines in utilities
output. By contrast, manufacturing output has increased somewhat more than we had
expected, with production gains fairly widespread across industries. Nevertheless,
manufacturing IP has still decelerated noticeably relative to the first half of the year,
reflecting a diminished impetus to production from inventory rebuilding. Looking ahead,
indicators of industrial activity are consistent with moderate gains in factory output in the
near term, while assembly schedules point to additional increases in motor vehicle output
following November’s production cuts. In total, we now expect manufacturing output to
rise at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the current quarter, in contrast to the small decline
we were projecting in the October Tealbook. We are also looking for a 5½ percent gain
in the first quarter of 2011, led by a sharp increase in motor vehicle production.
Household Spending
Real consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the third quarter,
and we expect a similar gain in the current quarter. Real spending in the control
category, which includes food services and most non-auto goods, rose ½ percent in
October, and, smoothing through the month-to-month volatility, has shown solid gains
throughout the year. In addition, outlays for motor vehicles and non-energy services—
two categories that had been recovering more slowly than others—have picked up
somewhat since midyear. As a result, real PCE is projected to accelerate over the second
half of this year to an average rate that is nearly ½ percentage point stronger than our
October Tealbook projection. The higher projected level of spending over the second
half of this year has been accompanied by an upward revision to the reported level of
personal income. In addition, the proposed payroll tax cut would raise disposable income
starting in January and is estimated to add roughly ¾ percentage point to spending
growth in the first quarter of 2011, bringing the projected increase in real consumer
spending in that quarter to 3¼ percent.

u t Although a variety of transitory factors have made the recent data on home sales
O
more difficult to interpret than usual, the underlying level of housing demand does not
&
e l appear to be picking up, contrary to what we were anticipating in previous Tealbooks.
v
e
D Moreover, the latest data on housing construction indicate that building activity remains
n
o exceptionally weak. Although recent data on single-family starts have come in close to
c
E
our expectations, permit issuance has remained below starts for several months, which we
c
i
t
s have interpreted as suggesting a noticeably slower rate of improvement in homebuilding
e
m
o going forward than we had been forecasting. In support of this view, industry sources
D
indicate that they expect little acceleration in housing activity over the coming year. In
all, we anticipate that real residential investment will decline at an annual rate of nearly
4 percent in the current quarter—not very different from our October projection—but we
have reduced our forecast for residential investment growth in the first quarter of 2011 by
10 percentage points, to 3 percent at an annual rate.
Business Investment
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to have decelerated
noticeably in the second half of this year from its rapid first-half pace. That said, the rise
in E&S spending in the third quarter—at an annual rate of 16 percent—was larger than
we had anticipated, reflecting sizable gains in outlays for transportation equipment and
for high-tech goods. Outside of transportation and high-tech, third-quarter outlays for
other equipment increased a little less than we were expecting, and recent declines in
orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods point to a further moderation in this
category of equipment investment in coming months. As a result, we expect real E&S
spending to post annualized increases of 5¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 and
9½ percent in the first quarter of 2011, close to our forecast in the October Tealbook.
Business outlays on nonresidential structures have continued to move lower, as
additional declines in building construction have more than offset increases in spending
on drilling and mining structures. While the downtrend in construction outlays on
buildings appears to have slowed somewhat, an overhang of unoccupied space and tight
lending conditions continue to weigh on this sector, and we expect outlays on building
construction to decline further in coming months. By contrast, elevated energy prices
should sustain solid increases in drilling and mining expenditures through the near term.
Although real inventory investment rose sharply in the third quarter, at this point
the available indicators do not suggest that the current level of stocks is excessive in the

end of the third quarter and are expected to decline further through the end of the year
o
D
before turning up in the first quarter of 2011. Outside of motor vehicles, we expect the
pace of stockbuilding to ease a bit in the fourth and first quarters as firms increase their
inventories in line with sales growth. On net, after contributing 1½ percentage points to
real GDP growth in the third quarter, total inventory investment is projected to subtract
about 1½ percentage points from the rate of change of real GDP this quarter and to have
essentially no effect on real growth in the first quarter of 2011.
Government
Real federal purchases increased at an annual rate of 9 percent in the third quarter,
with both defense and nondefense spending rising briskly. We project that growth in
federal purchases will slow to 2 percent in the fourth quarter and to 1 percent in the first
quarter of 2011, reflecting a deceleration in both defense and nondefense expenditures.
Real state and local purchases edged up at an annual rate of ¾ percent in the third
quarter, as reductions in employment, which were especially large in local education,
were offset by a sharp rise in construction spending. We expect total state and local
spending to be little changed, on net, through the first quarter of next year.
Foreign Trade
After rising at a robust annual rate of 16½ percent in the third quarter, we project
that real imports will register a decline of 4 percent in the current quarter and an increase
of 4¾ percent in the first quarter of next year. This swing in the quarterly pattern of
imports partly reflects problems with the BEA’s seasonal adjustment of oil prices, which
is projected to depress imports in the fourth quarter after boosting them in the third
quarter. We also expect a sharp deceleration in nonoil imports this quarter, as we believe
that the vigorous rebound from the steep declines of the crisis has largely run its course.
(See the box “What Explains the Recent Strength of Imports?” for additional detail.)
Compared with the October Tealbook, our outlook for import growth is about

o
l
1 percentage point lower in the current quarter and 1¾ percentage points higher in the u t
O
first quarter of next year, which partly reflects our reaction to incoming data from the
&
Department of Energy on oil imports. Meanwhile, exports of goods and services are e l
v
e
expected to accelerate from a third-quarter pace of 6¼ percent to 8¼ percent in both the D
n
current quarter and the first quarter of next year, as foreign economic growth strengthens. o
c
E
Our projection for export growth is a bit lower than in the October Tealbook, in part
c
i
t
because of the higher assumed exchange value of the dollar. s
e
m
o
D
In all, we expect net exports to contribute 1¾ percentage points to real GDP
growth in the current quarter—thus reversing the negative contribution made in the third
quarter—as exports accelerate and imports decline. In the first quarter of next year, the
resumption of import growth should reduce the contribution of net exports to GDP
growth to ¼ percentage point. Relative to the previous Tealbook, net exports make
roughly the same contribution to GDP growth in the current quarter; in the first quarter of
2011, the contribution is about ¼ percentage point smaller.
Prices and Wages
Recent data on core inflation have come in lower than we were expecting in the
October Tealbook. Core PCE price inflation was 0.8 percent at an annual rate in the third
quarter, 0.2 percentage point below our October projection. In addition, core PCE prices
were unchanged in October, which reduced our forecast for core PCE inflation in the
fourth quarter to 0.6 percent, down ½ percentage point from our previous projection. A
large portion of these low recent readings appears to reflect transitory factors. In the third
quarter, the revision to inflation is mainly attributable to an unexpected decline in the
volatile nonmarket component of PCE prices that we do not expect to persist. In the
fourth quarter, the inflation surprise is largely attributable to a drop in prices for medical
services and to weaker goods prices. However, the downward surprise in medical price
inflation reflects an outsized annual adjustment to Medicare hospital reimbursement
rates, and we still anticipate that higher import prices will put some upward pressure on
goods prices. Nonetheless, we have taken a small signal from the recent soft inflation
data. All told, we expect core PCE inflation to move back to an annual rate of 1 percent
in the first quarter of 2011; this pace is a touch lower than the one seen over the first half
of 2010, and is slightly lower than in our October forecast.
We project that total PCE price inflation will move up from an annual rate of
1 percent in the third quarter to 1¾ percent in the current quarter, mainly reflecting an

What Explains the Recent Strength of Imports?
&
l
e
v
e Real imports surged at an annual rate of 25 percent on average in the second and
D
third quarters of this year, while U.S. real GDP expanded at only a 2¼ percent
n
o pace.1 Part of the strength of imports can be explained by the composition of
c
E the increase in domestic demand, with relatively robust gains in demand for
c
i goods, the most import intensive component of spending. In particular, as
t
s
e shown in the lower‐left figure, private domestic demand for goods, defined as
m
o the sum of personal consumption expenditures on goods, investment in
D
equipment and software, and the change in private inventories, increased at an
annual rate of 11 percent on average in the second and third quarters of this year,
exceeding the overall rise in real GDP by almost 9 percentage points.
However, even relative to the expansion in private domestic demand for goods,
the surge in imports appears outsized. As shown by the red line in the lower‐
right figure, import penetration—the ratio of imports to domestic demand—
increased sharply in the manufacturing sector in recent quarters. This rise
appears primarily to be a rebound from the steep decline experienced during the
recession. Indeed, by this metric, imports now appear to have recovered to their
pre‐crisis trend, an upward trajectory driven primarily by increased globalization.
1
Real imports were pushed up in Q2 and Q3 by a quirk in the methodology used by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis for the seasonal adjustment of prices for imported petroleum.
However, even absent this artificial boost, imports were exceptionally strong.

u
Moreover, the sizable rise in imports has not prevented domestic production O
from increasing as well. Looking across 21 disaggregated manufacturing sectors, &
l
the figure below reveals that sectors with larger increases in import penetration e
v
e
have also generally recorded larger increases in industrial production since the D
business cycle trough. This correlation suggests that the increase in imports n
o
likely reflects the ongoing recovery of demand, as demand for domestic c
E
production has increased as well. c
i
t
s
e
Taken together, the evidence suggests that the recent surge in imports has m
o
largely reflected a rebound from depressed levels during the crisis. Historically, D
imports have exhibited greater cyclical volatility than GDP, in part because of the
greater volatility of demand for goods, which are more likely to be imported.
Just as this factor contributed to the plunge in imports during the recession, it
has contributed to the recent surge. In our forecast, we project that the rebound
in imports has largely run its course, as the growth in demand for goods slows
and also because we do not expect import penetration to continue to rise at the
pace of recent quarters. Accordingly, we are projecting a significant step‐down
in import growth, to a rate more in line with the projected pace of expansion in
U.S. economic activity.

u t acceleration in energy prices. Energy inflation is expected to move lower in the first
O
quarter of 2011; its effects are partly offset by the projected acceleration in core prices,
&
e l and so headline inflation edges lower to 1½ percent.
v
e
D
n Measures of long-term inflation expectations have not changed significantly since
o
c
E the October Tealbook. Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from the
c
i
t November Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained at
s
e
m
2.8 percent, in the middle of the narrow range seen over the past few years. Median
o
D
expected long-run PCE inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged down
to 2 percent in the fourth quarter, in part because of a change in the group of forecasters
in the survey panel. Finally, the TIPS-based five-year forward rate of inflation
compensation has edged up since the end of October.
Changes in labor compensation have remained subdued overall, though there have
been some upward revisions from the last Tealbook. The source data for the BEA’s wage
and salary estimates imply an upward revision to second-quarter labor compensation;
accordingly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now estimates that compensation per hour
increased nearly 3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter. In addition, the level
of average hourly earnings thus far in the fourth quarter has been a little higher than we
were expecting, and we now anticipate that hourly compensation will rise at an annual
rate of 2¼ percent in the second half of the year, which is ¼ percentage point faster than
our October Tealbook projection. As in our October forecast, we expect that the
annualized rate of increase of hourly compensation will be temporarily boosted to
2½ percent in the first quarter of 2011 by an increase in employer contributions to state
unemployment insurance funds. With these compensation gains, unit labor costs rise
½ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year, with a similar increase
expected in the first quarter of 2011.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
We have edged up our projection for real GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point in
2011, to 3¾ percent, and lowered real growth in 2012 by ¼ percentage point, to
4½ percent. These revisions reflect the interplay of several factors.
First, the assumed changes to the payroll tax and business expensing allowances
temporarily boost real consumption and business equipment spending. In total, these tax

&
l
e
v
e Second, we have become more pessimistic about the prospects for the housing
D
n market. Since last summer the incoming data on housing activity have repeatedly
o
c
E surprised us to the downside, and we now think that the substantial excess supply of
c
i
t vacant homes will likely be a larger and more persistent drag on construction and house
s
e
m
prices than we had previously thought. In addition, impediments to the availability of
o
D
mortgage credit and uncertainty about the future path of house prices appear to be
depressing demand to a greater extent than we had anticipated. Nevertheless, we still
expect residential construction activity to pick up over the projection period as these
factors weighing on demand diminish and improvements in real income and employment
act to lift housing demand. Hence, our forecast now calls for single-family starts to rise
from 430,000 units in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 520,000 units in the fourth quarter of
2011 (roughly 200,000 units below the pace projected in the October Tealbook), with a
further increase to 660,000 units by the end of 2012 (almost 350,000 units below the
October Tealbook pace).
We have also assumed a modestly stronger exchange value of the dollar for the
next several quarters, which implies a slightly smaller impetus from the foreign sector.
Net exports contribute about ¼ percentage point to real GDP growth in 2011 and almost
nothing to growth in 2012. Strong foreign GDP growth, the lagged effect of previous
declines in the dollar, and further anticipated dollar depreciation will help support export
growth going forward, while import demand is projected to pick up as U.S. GDP
accelerates.
Although these revisions result in a slightly flatter contour of real GDP growth
over the medium term, the basic dynamics of the projected recovery in real activity
remain essentially the same. Specifically, we continue to expect aggregate demand to
improve for several reasons: The drag from earlier declines in wealth diminishes,
financial conditions remain supportive and lending standards ease further, household and
business confidence rises, and the labor market gradually recovers. Working against this
improvement in demand is a large overhang of residential and commercial real estate, the
waning of federal fiscal stimulus, budgetary pressures on state and local governments,
and continued credit constraints due in part to the medium-term effects of financial
regulatory reform. (See the box “The Macroeconomic Effect of Basel III Requirements.”)

The Macroeconomic Effect of Basel III Requirements
&
l
e
v
e During the global financial crisis that began in mid‐2007, many systemically important financial
D
institutions came under significant market pressure because they were seen as having
n
o insufficient capital and access to liquidity to withstand the stresses that emerged. As a result,
c
E the international regulatory community began a reassessment of capital and liquidity standards,
c
i the details of which have taken shape in recent months. Banking institutions will be expected
t
s
e to hold substantially higher levels of capital, especially common equity capital, which is most
m
o capable of absorbing losses and limiting spillovers to other institutions. In addition, a
D
requirement for coverage of potential short‐term liquidity needs will become effective in 2015
following an observation period during which regulators can further assess the implications of
the proposed standard.
Under the new capital framework, the amount of required capital relative to risk‐weighted
assets increases and the risk weights applied to assets are adjusted to better reflect underlying
risk. In both cases, the changes are implemented gradually over the coming decade. For
example, the required minimum level of common equity relative to risk‐weighted assets is
slated to rise from 2 percent currently to 3.5 percent in 2013 and 4.5 percent by 2015 (see table
on facing page). Requirements for Tier 1 capital will also increase over time, from 4 percent
currently to 6 percent by 2015. In addition, the new framework includes a capital conservation
buffer on top of the required minimum level of common equity: Institutions whose level of
common equity is above the required minimum but within this buffer range will face restrictions
on, for example, dividend payments and compensation practices. This buffer rises slowly after
2015, pushing the combination of regulatory minimum and conservation buffer for common
equity to 7 percent of assets by the beginning of 2019.
Several considerations suggest that the medium‐term effects of the new capital framework on
credit availability and real activity are likely to prove modest and are consistent with the staff’s
outlook. A factor mitigating the potential drag on activity is the improvement in banks’ capital
positions that has occurred since the onset of the crisis, as illustrated in the figure by the
increase in the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk‐weighted assets for large banks (at the bank level).
Despite this improvement, some banks may wish to increase their level of capital relative to
assets further to maintain an adequate discretionary buffer above regulatory requirements,
consistent with their past behavior. Moreover, there is substantial heterogeneity in bank
positions and some large bank holding companies will likely need to accumulate additional
capital to meet the new requirements. Nonetheless, many institutions will be able to meet such
needs, for the most part, through retained earnings, and we do not anticipate significant
downward pressure on bank lending.
This evaluation seems broadly consistent with views among financial market participants—such
as reports from industry analysts suggesting that the requirements are less stringent than
originally anticipated—and with findings in related research. For example, a coordinated
international research effort suggested that an increase in required capital of 3 to 4 percent of
risk‐weighted assets implemented over a four‐year period would likely lower the level of U.S.
real GDP by roughly ¾ percent over the course of several years, implying modest year‐to‐year

u
effects.1 That said, this research also pointed to downside risks to this assessment if banks were O
to feel competitive pressure to raise capital more quickly than required or if the overall &
l
macroeconomic environment weakened banks’ ability to meet capital needs through retained e
v
e
earnings or resulted in further capital losses. In such adverse scenarios, the drag on real activity D
could prove several times as large as we currently anticipate. n
o
c
E
The introduction of liquidity requirements, in the form of a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), should c
i
t
help ensure that banks adequately manage their exposures to liquidity risk and also help the s
e
authorities to manage the orderly resolution of insolvent institutions. The LCR requires an m
o
institution to have enough unencumbered, high‐quality liquid assets to cover, at a minimum, the D
institution’s projected net cash outflows over a 30‐day horizon under a stress scenario that
combines a substantial idiosyncratic shock with a moderate systemic disturbance. Moreover,
the stress scenario penalizes a variety of short‐term commitments, such as lines of credit for
financial institutions and back‐up lines for commercial paper programs, which will make pricing
of such programs significantly less attractive. Banks may also face higher funding costs as a
result of the LCR, part of which they would pass on to loan customers. As a result, borrowing
costs for the nonfinancial business sector are likely to increase somewhat, implying a small drag
on real GDP.
Perhaps a more substantial concern about the LCR is its effect on financial stability. While the
new liquidity requirements probably will discourage banks from providing credit lines without
adequate resources to meet potential draws, the higher cost to banks of providing such
services is likely to push some of these activities outside of the regulated financial sector, where
they are more difficult to monitor and where liquidity crises may be more costly to address.
Moreover, once banking institutions are subject to the LCR, in financial crises they would
presumably demand an increased buffer of liquid assets above the level required to satisfy the
regulatory requirement. Without an increase in liquidity provided by the central bank, the result
would likely be significant pressures in funding markets despite the LCR.

O
they do combine to yield a cyclical rebound that is much more subdued than would
&

v
e
D
n The projected acceleration in consumer spending reflects many of the forces that
o
c
E we anticipate will drive the broader economic recovery, including steadily improving
c
i
t credit conditions, a faster pace of job creation, an accompanying increase in confidence

m
about employment and income prospects, and a diminished drag from earlier wealth

D
declines. Next year, we expect real consumption to rise 3½ percent, ½ percentage point
above our October Tealbook forecast. In 2012, consumption is projected to rise
4 percent; this rate of growth is ½ percentage point below the October Tealbook
projection, reflecting the consequences of the lower assumed path of house prices for
household wealth and the expiration of the 2011 payroll tax reduction. The saving rate is
projected to rise from 5½ percent at the end of 2010 to 6¼ percent at the end of next year;
thereafter, the saving rate drops back to 5½ percent in 2012.
Similarly, outlays on equipment and software are projected to post solid gains—
more than 10 percent per year on average over the next couple of years—as rising sales
and improved business confidence induce firms to replace aging capital and expand their
capacity. In addition, investment demand should continue to be boosted by an increasing
willingness of firms to undertake investment projects that were postponed during the
recession. Finally, we expect that the new expensing provisions will slightly raise the
rate of growth of equipment investment in 2011 and reduce its growth rate in 2012.
High vacancy rates, low commercial property prices, and persistent tight
borrowing conditions for commercial real estate are expected to significantly restrain
nonresidential construction. We therefore expect investment in nonresidential structures
to decline until the end of 2012, albeit at a slower pace than over the past year.
Finally, government purchases are projected to make only a small contribution to
real GDP growth over the medium term. Reductions in spending related to overseas
military operations and the phasing out of stimulus-related nondefense spending are
expected to hold the increase in real federal expenditures to 1 percent next year and to
¼ percent in 2012. Meanwhile, state and local governments will likely see only a modest
easing in budgetary pressures as a cyclical increase in revenues is offset by an unwinding
in federal stimulus grants. As a result, real spending by these jurisdictions is projected to
rise just ½ percent in 2011 and 1¼ percent in 2012.

e We have made no material change to our estimates of potential GDP in this

D Productivity and the Labor Market
Given the modest changes that we made to our forecast of real activity, the
projected dynamics of the labor market recovery are very similar to the October Tealbook
forecast. In particular, we believe that the gap between actual labor productivity and its
structural level that opened up last year will continue to narrow over the medium term as
firms add workers both to meet rising production needs and to relieve pressures on their
existing workforces. Our forecast therefore calls for employment growth to pick up
steadily over the projection period and for actual labor productivity to rise 1¾ percent
next year and 2 percent in 2012, on average a little less than our estimate of its structural
growth rate.
The level of private employment in this forecast is also little changed from the
October Tealbook. We project that private employment gains will average about
230,000 per month in 2011 and 280,000 per month in 2012. With this pace of job
growth, we expect the unemployment rate to decline from 9¾ percent in the current
quarter to 8 percent by the end of 2012.
Resource Utilization
The amount of current and projected slack remains very large in this Tealbook
forecast. By our estimate, the unemployment rate in the current quarter is about
3 percentage points above the effective NAIRU; at the end of the projection period, the
unemployment gap is 2 percentage points.1 This extended period of labor market slack is
likely to be associated with other features of a weak labor market, including below-trend
labor force participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily on part-time
1 The effective NAIRU includes the effect of extended and emergency unemployment benefits (EEB),
and is the level of the unemployment rate that we view as being consistent with no slack in resource
utilization. As the EEB programs are phased out, the effective NAIRU declines from its current level of
6¾ percent to around 6 percent by the end of 2012.

The projected GDP gap narrows from negative 6½ percent in the current quarter e
D
to negative 3¾ percent by the end of 2012. We continue to expect that the GDP gap will n
o
c
close more slowly than the rate at which unused plant capacity in the industrial sector is E
c
i
taken up, in part because manufacturing capacity expands slowly over the forecast period. t
s
e
m
Indeed, by the end of 2012, our projection calls for the factory operating rate to approach
o
D
its long-run average despite the still-sizable output gap prevailing at that time.
Compensation and Prices
We expect that the wide margin of labor market slack, together with low rates of
price inflation, will continue to restrain labor costs over the projection period. In our
forecast, the Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation rises about
2 percent per year in 2011 and 2012, while the employment cost index increases at a
roughly similar rate. Combined with the moderate gains in productivity that we project,
these increases in compensation imply nearly flat unit labor costs over the medium term.
Prices of imported core goods (all goods excluding computers, semiconductors,
and fuels) are expected to rise at an average annual rate of about 5 percent in the current
quarter and first quarter of next year, boosted by commodity price increases, previous
declines in the exchange value of the dollar, and a near-term pickup in foreign inflation.
Our forecast calls for core import price inflation to decline to about 1½ percent over the
remainder of the medium term; this slowdown reflects an assumed deceleration in
commodity prices, lower rates of foreign inflation, and only a modest depreciation of the
dollar. Although higher core import prices are expected to make a small positive
contribution to core PCE inflation in the near term, their influence diminishes to zero by
the end of the forecast period.
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that reduced labor cost pressures and low
levels of resource utilization will put downward pressure on core PCE inflation over the
projection period, but that further disinflation will be checked by continued stability in
inflation expectations. We now project that core PCE inflation will be 0.9 percent in
2011 and 2012, which is 0.1 percentage point below the October Tealbook forecast in
each year. As noted previously, this small downward revision reflects our view that the
recent data on core prices suggest that the rate of underlying inflation is a touch lower

What Do Different Measures of Underlying Inflation Say
&
l about the Degree of Deceleration in Prices?
e
v
e
D
Transitory factors often obscure the underlying trend in overall price inflation. To
n
o mitigate this problem, economists use various techniques to screen out the noise in the
c
E
data. Thus, the staff closely monitors a variety of measures, including versions of both
c
t i CPI and PCE price inflation that exclude food and energy prices and trimmed‐mean
s
e
m measures, which exclude a certain percentage of price changes from both ends of the
o distribution of price changes.1
D
As shown in the top and middle figures on the facing page, all of these measures of
underlying inflation have declined considerably since the onset of the recent recession:
Excluding food and energy, the CPI and PCE price indexes (the black solid lines) increased
at a rate of less than 1 percent over the 12 months ended in October, down from about
2½ percent over the 12 months prior to the recession. Similarly, market‐based core PCE
price inflation (the solid red line in the middle figure)—which also excludes the so‐called
“non‐market” components of PCE prices that are generally not based on detailed
consumer or producer price indexes—has declined steadily since late 2007 and is also
now running about 1½ percentage points below its pre‐recession rate. Even excluding
the prices of housing services (rent of tenant‐ and owner‐occupied housing), both CPI
and market‐based PCE prices excluding food and energy (the red dashed lines) have
decelerated noticeably.
The decline in the trimmed‐mean measures of inflation (the green lines) has been even
more pronounced. The 12‐month change in both the trimmed‐mean CPI and the trimmed‐
mean PCE price index has fallen from a little less than 3 percent at the end of 2007 to
about ¾ percent in October of this year.
Another way of illustrating the breadth of the deceleration in prices over the last three
years is through a diffusion index; such indexes capture the prevalence of price increases
rather than their average intensity. The diffusion index of PCE price changes (two
versions of which are shown in the bottom figure) is the share of component price
indexes that have increased minus the share that have decreased over the past
12 months. As can be seen, these indexes have stepped down noticeably since the end
of 2007.
Thus, even though underlying inflation can be measured in many different ways, all these
metrics show a decline in underlying inflation over the past few years.
1
The trimmed‐mean CPI, constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, excludes 8 percent
from the bottom of the distribution and 8 percent from the top of the distribution. The trimmed‐mean
PCE price index, constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, excludes the bottom 24 percent of
the distribution and the top 31 percent of the distribution.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
D
e
n
o
We have extended the staff forecast to 2015 using the FRB/US model and staff c
E
assessments of long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors. The c
i
t
s
e
contour of the long-run outlook depends on the following key assumptions: m
o
D
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long
run, consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections
provided by FOMC participants at the November meeting.
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities follow the baseline portfolio
projections reported in Book B. We assume that the projected decline in
the System’s holdings beginning in 2013 will contribute about 25 basis
points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the 2013–15 period.
 Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to
normal levels, and banks ease their lending standards somewhat further.
 The federal government budget deficit narrows to about 4½ percent of
GDP by the end of 2015. This improvement reflects the effects of the
economic recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further
policy actions after 2012 aimed at reducing the deficit.
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate
1 percent per year in the 2013–15 period. The price of WTI crude oil
stays roughly flat at around $90 per barrel through the end of 2015,
consistent with futures prices. Under these assumptions, movements in
the prices of energy and imports have only minor implications for
domestic inflation in the extension. Foreign real GDP expands, on
average, about 3¼ percent per year from 2013 through 2015, a bit above
its trend rate.
 Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declines from 6 percent to
5¼ percent, as the functioning of the labor market improves. Potential
GDP expands 3 percent per year, on average, from 2013 to 2015.

l
u t The economy enters 2013 with the staff’s estimate of the output gap quite wide,
O
the unemployment rate well above the estimated NAIRU, and inflation very low. In the
&
e l long-run projection, however, improving confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and
v
e
D supportive financial conditions eventually enable the level of aggregate demand to catch
n
o up with aggregate supply and inflation to move noticeably closer to its desired level.
c
E
Specifically, the extended forecast shows real GDP rising at an annual rate of 4¾ percent
c
i
t
s on average in 2013 and 2014, considerably faster than its potential pace; as a result,
e
m
o unemployment declines appreciably and inflation begins to rise slowly. In response, the
D
federal funds rate begins to increase in the first quarter of 2013 and reaches 3¼ percent
by late 2014.2 By 2015, with improvements in confidence and financial conditions
largely complete, and with the federal funds rate climbing further to 4 percent, gains in
real GDP moderate substantially. Nevertheless, overall economic growth remains robust
enough relative to potential to reduce the unemployment rate to the NAIRU by late 2015;
in addition, inflation continues to rise and reaches 1½ percent.
2 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the “outcome-based” rule,
described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The main development in the foreign economies since the October Tealbook has
been the intensification of financial turmoil in Europe. (See the box “Developments in
Ireland and the Euro-Area Periphery” and the “Financial Developments” section.) At
present, it is too soon to tell how these renewed stresses will be resolved and how they
will affect global economic performance. Our current judgment is that economic activity
in the peripheral euro-area countries will indeed be restrained by less favorable financing
conditions, ongoing banking sector vulnerabilities, and aggressive fiscal consolidations.
k
o
However, absent further deterioration in the European banking system or sovereign o
l
t
u
funding conditions, the spillovers from the ongoing stresses will likely be limited. O
&
Accordingly, and as recent indicators have generally been in line with our expectations,
l
e
our overall forecast for foreign economic activity is little changed from the October v
e
D
Tealbook. That said, the risk of adverse tail events has clearly risen, and we explore the
n
o
effects on U.S. growth of a further intensification of financial pressures in Europe in the c
E
l
“Risks and Uncertainties” section. ’
t
n
I
After slowing considerably in the third quarter, aggregate foreign GDP growth is
estimated to have picked up to 2¾ percent in the current quarter. This pattern has been
shaped largely by the emerging market economies (EMEs), many of which decelerated in
the third quarter following outsized first-half gains but have again picked up the pace. In
the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), activity has also slowed from earlier in the year,
but we do not expect much improvement in growth in the near term as fiscal
consolidation and saving to rebuild financial positions restrain spending. Over time, as
private domestic demand gains momentum, we predict overall foreign growth to
strengthen to about 3½ percent in 2012.
A recent acceleration of food and energy prices has led us to raise our estimate of
foreign headline inflation in the current quarter to nearly 4 percent at an annual rate, up
about 1½ percentage points from the October Tealbook. Core inflation, however, has
been relatively steady across the foreign economies. As we expect the recent rise in food
and energy price inflation to be transitory, our projection calls for headline inflation to
subside to about 2¼ percent by the end of next year. Inflation should remain at about that
level in 2012 as continued resource slack in the advanced economies helps to keep price

Developments in Ireland and the Euro‐Area Periphery
Financial tensions in Ireland escalated over the past two months. As
shown in the left‐hand figure, interest rate spreads on Irish 10‐year
sovereign bonds over German bunds widened from an already elevated
4 percentage points in mid‐October to around 6 percentage points by
early November. Two developments contributed to the heightened
tensions: (1) discussion of a German proposal to eventually force the
restructuring of private holdings of sovereign debt and (2) increased
concerns over Irish banks’ growing real estate loan losses and their
associated funding difficulties. Afflicted in part by deposit flight, Irish
k banks have become increasingly dependent on funding from the
o
o
l European Central Bank (ECB).
t
u
O
& With access to market funding increasingly limited and corporate bank
e l deposits falling sharply, the Irish government entered into discussions
v
e with European Union (EU) authorities and the International Monetary
D
Fund (IMF), eventually agreeing on a rescue package totaling €85 billion,
n
o of which €22.5 billion is from the IMF and €45 billion is from a
c
E
combination of EU resources and bilateral loans by individual EU
l
’
n t countries. In addition, the Irish government will contribute €17.5 billion
I
from its pension fund and cash reserves, to be used to support Irish
banks. The loan package is expected to be sufficient to keep the Irish
government from needing market funding for two years and to stabilize
the Irish banking sector and provide it with a capital injection of
€10 billion (rising to as much as €35 billion, if needed). For its part, Ireland
has agreed to implement a fiscal consolidation of €15 billion (9 percent of
GDP) over the next four years, two‐thirds of which will be spending cuts,
on top of the austerity measures already adopted in the past two years.
The Irish government intends to maintain its guarantee on senior bank
debt; that guarantee was the main cause of the sharp run‐up in Irish
government debt over the past three years.
The Irish rescue package does not seem to have calmed markets, and the
focus has turned to the possibility that official assistance would also be
required for other peripheral euro‐area countries with high fiscal deficits
and debts. The right‐hand figure shows the peripheral countries that are
most vulnerable in those dimensions. Aside from Greece and Ireland,
market pressures have been most acute for Portugal, where slow
economic growth and significant structural and competitiveness
problems threaten to make its government debt unsustainable.
Investors also showed increasing concern about Spain because of its
large fiscal deficit and problems at its banks—both owing to its housing
boom and bust. The debt level in Spain is relatively low, but it could have
trouble financing itself at elevated interest rates. In addition, Spain is
Page 36 of 100

--- Page 40 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
much larger than the other peripheral economies, and investors are
concerned that its potential financing needs are too large to be covered
by existing mechanisms. Finally, concerns have also emerged that the
crisis could spread even beyond Spain to other high‐debt euro‐area
countries such as Italy and Belgium.
Partly in response to these developments, the ECB announced following
its December 2 policy meeting that it would delay exit from its
nonstandard liquidity measures. Although the ECB did not make any
statement about the future of its program to buy the debt of vulnerable
euro‐area countries, market participants reported an increased intensity
of ECB purchases of such debt following the meeting, leading to a sharp
k
o
decline in sovereign spreads for Ireland and Portugal. o

pressures contained. Relative to the October Tealbook, our forecast of inflation in the
second half of 2011 and in 2012 is little changed.
We continue to expect the AFEs to maintain highly accommodative monetary
policies throughout the forecast period, with the recent flare-up of financial tensions in
the euro area delaying the European Central Bank’s (ECB) windup of its special liquidity
provisions. In the EMEs, we assume further policy tightening, although heightened
concerns over capital flows and exchange rate pressures have added to the uncertainty
about future monetary policy responses.
k
o ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
o
l
t
u
O
We continue to forecast an anemic recovery in the AFEs, where growth has
&
l slowed from 3½ percent at an annual rate in the first half of this year to an estimated
e
v
e 1¾ percent in the second half. This step-down in growth is slightly larger than was
D
n anticipated in October, reflecting some softness in third-quarter GDP for Canada and the
o
c
E euro area. We expect AFE economic growth to remain around 2 percent through 2011,
l
’
t
n held down by increasing fiscal consolidation and continuing balance sheet repair. In
I
2012, growth picks up to 2½ percent as balance sheet positions improve and private
spending strengthens.
Intensified concerns over fiscal sustainability and banking sector vulnerabilities
have weighed on our growth outlook for the euro area, but greater momentum in the
German economy and the positive effects of the euro’s recent depreciation have gone the
other way, leaving our forecast down only a little. Our working assumption is that
Portugal will follow Greece and Ireland in requiring a financial assistance package from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, but that other countries will
avoid such serious financial pressures. In order to reassure markets that sufficient
resources exist to backstop Spain and other vulnerable countries, we assume that
European authorities will at some point increase the funds available for official
assistance. We also assume that authorities will take measures to shore up confidence in
the banking sector, including additional stress tests and continued liquidity provision and
sovereign bond purchases by the ECB. Even with these actions, however, the possibility
of a more serious disruption to sovereign and bank financing in peripheral Europe and
beyond poses a heightened risk to our outlook.

Euro Area
Real GDP growth for the euro area moved down from 4 percent in the second
quarter to 1½ percent in the third quarter, just a little below our expectations. Economic
performance within the euro area continued to diverge. Third-quarter German growth
was nearly twice the euro-area average, and recent indicators show continued solid
performance: German retail sales surged in October, consumer confidence and
purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) shot up in November, and the German IFO index of
business sentiment posted a record high. In contrast, Spanish activity stagnated in the
third quarter, and Greek GDP declined nearly 4½ percent.
k
o
o
The recent renewal of financial stresses should weigh on euro-area growth going l
t
u
forward, but these effects should be mitigated by the stimulus to net exports stemming O
&
from the depreciation of the euro over the past month. In light of the weaker euro and the
l
e
v
relatively strong incoming data, we now expect less slowing of growth in Germany. e
D
Nonetheless, given the sharper slowing we now project for the rest of the euro area, our n
o
forecast for overall euro-area activity is a little weaker than that in the October Tealbook, c
E
l
with GDP growth declining to about 1 percent in 2011 and picking up to 2¼ percent in t ’
n
I
2012. Indeed, the deteriorating outlook for growth in the peripheral euro-area economies
has heightened uncertainty regarding their ability to reduce their fiscal deficits, and this
poses the risk of further financial instability.
Euro-area headline inflation has exceeded our expectations, rising to nearly
2 percent on a 12-month basis in November. This partly reflects a rise in energy prices,
but core inflation edged up as well—to just above 1 percent—and we expect it to be
supported in the near term by further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices
embedded in fiscal consolidation plans. Thereafter, headline inflation should ease to
around 1½ percent. We continue to assume that the ECB will not raise its benchmark
policy rate, currently at 1 percent, until the second half of 2012. Before then, we expect
the ECB to gradually exit from its unconventional liquidity policies, though the increase
in financial tensions has delayed that exit.
Japan
Real GDP rose a better-than-expected 3.9 percent in the third quarter, as
purchases of fuel-efficient cars surged before the expiration of a subsidy program in early
September. Payback from this program should lead to a noticeable drop in private
Page 41 of 100

--- Page 45 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
consumption in the current quarter, contributing to a projected contraction in real GDP of
1½ percent. Smoothing through these quarterly swings, our outlook for GDP growth is
about unchanged for the second half of the year and beyond relative to the October
Tealbook. We continue to anticipate that real GDP will expand 1½ percent in 2011 and
2 percent in 2012.
In October, 12-month inflation turned positive for the first time since December
2008. However, this development was due in part to a one-time hike in tobacco taxes,
and we continue to project deflation to persist over the next two years. Accordingly, we
have also maintained our assumption that the Bank of Japan will moderately step up its
k
o asset purchases.
o
l
t
u
O
Canada
&
l
e
v Real GDP rose a disappointing 1 percent in the third quarter, as domestic demand
e
D
accelerated but net exports subtracted from growth. Consumption and fixed investment
n
o
c expanded robustly, and imports of capital goods rose almost 30 percent at an annual rate.
E
’ l We estimate that GDP increased 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, with a rebound in
t
n
I exports and a slowing of imports reducing the drag from the external sector. Domestic
demand should remain solid, keeping GDP growth around 2½ percent over the forecast
period. We expect Canadian headline inflation on a four-quarter basis to rise from
around 1½ percent in the current quarter to a touch above the Bank of Canada’s 2 percent
target by the middle of next year as economic slack diminishes. After tightening over the
first three quarters of the year, the Bank of Canada is assumed to keep monetary policy
on hold through the end of 2011 before raising rates further to keep inflation near its
target.
United Kingdom
We estimate that GDP growth has slowed from 3 percent in the third quarter to
2 percent in the fourth as fiscal retrenchment begins to bite and the cyclical impetus from
the inventory swing wanes. We see GDP growth edging up to 2½ percent by 2012 as
fading financial stresses help revive private demand and as a low sterling stimulates
exports. Downside risks have increased because of heightened financial instability in
peripheral euro-area economies, particularly given the United Kingdom’s vulnerable
fiscal position and strong ties to Ireland. Nonetheless, expectations of further asset
purchases by the Bank of England (BOE) have declined following the publication of the
Page 42 of 100

--- Page 46 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
BOE’s quarterly forecast, which showed a more optimistic outlook for growth than had
been expected, and amid incoming data showing resilient inflation. The 12-month
change in consumer prices ticked up to 3.2 percent in October, pushed up by rising
gasoline prices, and should remain above the BOE’s 2 percent target until early 2012.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
Recent data releases confirm that growth in the EMEs slowed sharply from the
rapid pace earlier this year. We now estimate that third-quarter growth was 2½ percent,
down from 8¼ percent in the second quarter. This steep decline is in large part an artifact
k
of highly volatile data for Mexico and Singapore. But EME growth slowed more o
o
l
t
generally as well, owing to the maturation of the inventory cycle and associated rebound u
O
in trade, the unwinding of fiscal stimulus measures, and a continued tightening of &
l
monetary policies in several countries. In the current quarter, EME growth is estimated e
v
e
at 4 percent, up about ½ percentage point from the October Tealbook, as greater-than- D
n
expected strength in China and Mexico more than offset somewhat weaker growth o
c
E
elsewhere. As the United States and other advanced economies pick up steam, real GDP
l
’
t
n
growth in the EMEs should rise to around 5 percent in 2012, little changed from the I
previous Tealbook.
Consumer prices in the EMEs have recently accelerated, led by rising food prices.
The food price increases stem from both country-specific conditions as well as recent
increases in the global prices of food commodities such as wheat, corn, and soybeans.
We view the sharp rise in food inflation as transitory and expect that EME headline
inflation, after peaking at around 5 percent at an annual rate in the current quarter, will
fall to about 3¼ percent over the forecast period.
China
Recent indicators point to continued economic strength following real GDP
growth of 9¾ percent in the third quarter. Industrial production grew robustly in
October, and the PMI rose to 55 in November. Domestic demand in October appeared
firm, with fixed-asset investment and nominal retail sales remaining more than 20 percent
above their year-earlier levels.
Inflation over the 12 months ending in October rose to 4½ percent, almost entirely
reflecting higher food prices. In response, the authorities have released reserves of grain
Page 43 of 100

--- Page 47 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
and other foods, and have raised the possibility of imposing price controls. Additionally,
the People’s Bank of China raised the reserve requirement ratio twice in November for a
cumulative increase of 1 percentage point. Global financial markets reacted negatively to
the moves, fearing that authorities will tighten excessively and squelch growth. Although
we view this development as a potential downside risk, we continue to expect that
Chinese authorities will be successful in adjusting policy to achieve GDP growth in the
neighborhood of 8 to 9 percent going forward.
Other Emerging Asia
k Economic activity in the rest of emerging Asia contracted in the third quarter.
o
o
While most of this decline reflected a steep drop in Singapore’s volatile output, real GDP
l
t
u
O also declined in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. We believe that many of the
&
emerging Asian economies are following, with a lag, a business cycle similar to that of
l
e
v
e China, where growth slowed in the second quarter but showed vigor in the third. The
D
most recent PMI releases provide some evidence that these other Asian economies are
n
o
c indeed turning a corner; the November PMIs for both Korea and Taiwan swung above
E
l
t ’ 50 after being in the contraction range in the previous few months.
n
I
India, Korea, and Thailand recently raised their policy rates to help fight inflation,
which has risen across emerging Asia. Although, as discussed below, some data point to
a slowing of capital flows to EMEs, such flows remain an important concern in many
countries. We now assume that, to better manage both inflation and capital inflows,
some of the emerging Asian economies will allow their currencies to appreciate a bit
more than in the previous Tealbook.
Latin America
Real GDP growth in Latin America slowed to 3 percent in the third quarter, and
we estimate that growth remained around that pace in the current quarter. By 2012, Latin
American growth is expected to move up to around 3¾ percent. The contour of the Latin
American forecast is driven largely by Mexico, where GDP looks to be expanding at a
3¼ percent pace in the current quarter. This estimate is about 1¾ percentage points
higher than in the October Tealbook, reflecting more favorable indicators of domestic
demand as well as a stronger estimate of U.S. manufacturing production, which is highly
correlated with Mexican output. We project Mexican GDP growth to rise to nearly
4 percent in 2012, owing in large part to improvement in the U.S. economy.
Page 44 of 100

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
For Brazil, we raised our forecast for growth to about 4 percent in the current
quarter and the next, owing in part to our assessment that expansionary fiscal policies
will remain in place a bit longer than previously anticipated. With stronger near-term
activity and inflation picking up to 5½ percent in the 12 months through November, we
now assume a somewhat faster pace of monetary policy tightening. Accordingly, we
have marked down our projection for GDP growth a bit over the remainder of the
forecast period to an average of 3¾ percent.
CAPITAL FLOWS TO EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
k
In recent months, authorities in many EMEs have expressed concerns about o
o
l
t
mounting capital inflows and the attendant pressures on their exchange rates and asset u
O
prices. This section reviews developments in private capital flows to EMEs since the &
l
financial crisis. As background, we note that several fundamental factors currently e
v
e
support such flows: D
n
• a continuing return of investors to EMEs after the large outflows experienced o
c
E
during the crisis; l
’
t
n
I
• more-favorable growth prospects in the EMEs than in the advanced
economies, reflecting both the two-speed nature of the global economic
recovery as well as long-standing differences in growth potential; and
• the divergent monetary policy stances of the two groups.
With respect to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program in
particular has been criticized for lowering U.S. long-term interest rates and thus
encouraging investors to purchase riskier assets in the EMEs.
Indeed, net private capital flows to Latin American and Asian EMEs as a share of
their aggregate GDP, the most comprehensive but least timely data available, were quite
elevated in the second half of 2009 relative to their pre-crisis average (the blue bars in
top-left panel).1 In part, these strong inflows reflect a recovery following the large
outflows during the crisis. Private capital inflows slowed in the first half of 2010 but
remained sizable. Combined with significant current account surpluses (the orange bars),
these inflows have placed upward pressure on EME currencies.
1 For the purposes of this section, the EMEs comprise Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia,
Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand,
and Venezuela.

Because EME officials, to varying degrees, have resisted currency appreciation
through purchases of dollars and other foreign exchange, changes in EME reserve assets
may provide some indication of the intensity of recent capital flows. As shown in the
figure for official reserve holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, these
holdings increased steadily from mid-September to early November, which we see as the
counterpart to strong net private capital flows into EMEs. In recent weeks, however,
these holdings have leveled out, suggesting diminished inflows to the EMEs, perhaps
reflecting increased investor risk aversion amid renewed financial stresses in the euro
area. This pattern of strong private capital inflows in September and October followed
by moderation in November is also apparent in data on net inflows to emerging market
k
o
equity and bond funds (the middle panels). o

Data for private capital flows from the United States to the EMEs, which provide &
l
a window into global flows and are more timely and detailed, exhibit a pattern similar to e
v
e
that of total private flows to these economies. Starting with banking flows, net claims of D
n
U.S.-resident banks on Asian and Latin American EMEs declined sharply in the second o
c
E
half of 2008 and have since rebounded only to their pre-crisis level (red line in bottom- l
’
t
n
left panel). A great deal of U.S. banking flows to the EMEs are channeled through the I
United Kingdom and the Caribbean banking centers, but the level of U.S. net claims on
these entities, while rising briskly of late, remains below prior highs (the blue line).2 All
told, net lending of U.S. banks to EMEs through October does not appear out of line with
historical trends. Unlike the bank flows to EMEs, U.S. purchases of EME securities
picked up noticeably in September and October (red line in bottom-right panel).
However, they were not outsized relative to U.S. purchases of securities issued by Europe
or “other” countries (which includes Canada).
All together, the various data sources suggest that the rebound in private capital
flows to EMEs, which began in early 2009, has sufficed only to return the level of net
claims on these countries, broadly speaking, to its long-term trend. Furthermore, recent
flows from the United States to the EMEs do not appear unusually large relative to the
U.S. flows to other countries. These findings support the view that accommodative U.S.
monetary policy may have played a smaller role in driving capital flows to EMEs than
some observers have suggested.
2 BIS data through the first half of 2010 indicate that claims of the financial centers on EMEs have
followed the same pattern.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
Financial Developments
Changes in financial conditions were mixed over the intermeeting period. Interest
rates at both short and longer maturities rose substantially, on net, reflecting an apparent
reassessment by investors of the likely ultimate size of the Federal Reserve’s asset
purchase program, economic data that were seen by market participants as suggesting a
somewhat improved economic outlook, and the tentative agreement between the
Administration and the Congress regarding a package of fiscal measures. Renewed
concerns about fiscal strains and banking-sector problems in the euro-area periphery
contributed to increased volatility in financial markets but did not appear to prompt a
widespread pullback from risky assets. Since the November FOMC meeting, broad stock
price indexes have risen moderately, while risk spreads on corporate bonds are
unchanged or down slightly on balance. TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation
increased at the 5-year maturity but only edged up 5 to 10 years ahead. Short-term
funding markets showed some signs of modest strain, but funding conditions for
domestic institutions were generally stable. The dollar appreciated against most other
currencies, mainly on the concerns about fiscal pressures in Europe and the revised
outlook for monetary policy in the United States.
s
Overall borrowing by nonfinancial corporations was robust again in November, t
n
e
and indicators of credit quality continued to improve. Meanwhile, financing conditions m
p
for commercial real estate remain tight, and the performance of commercial mortgage o
l
e
v
debt deteriorated further. For households, the issues surrounding foreclosure e
D
improprieties appear to have had little, if any, negative effect on mortgage financing l
a
i
c
activity, but mortgage debt has stayed on a downward trend amid delinquency and default n
a
n
rates that remain elevated. In contrast, consumer credit outstanding appears to be i
F
stabilizing after two years of runoffs, and the credit quality of consumer debt has
continued to improve.
Core loans at commercial banks contracted again in October and November,
though at a somewhat slower pace than in the third quarter. Bank profitability was little
changed last quarter, as reductions in loan loss provisions were about offset by higher
noninterest expenses. M2 expanded moderately in November, as strong growth in liquid
deposits and currency continued to more than offset declines in small time deposits and
retail money market mutual funds. Responses to the December 2010 Senior Credit

Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) indicated an easing in
credit terms across all counterparties and for securities financing transactions with a wide
range of collateral over the previous three months.
TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS
The November FOMC statement elicited limited immediate price action in most
asset classes, suggesting that the outcome had largely been anticipated. 1 However, yields
on 30-year Treasury bonds moved up sharply in response to the Desk announcement,
which indicated that the distribution of purchases would be more heavily weighted
toward short- and intermediate-term securities than some market participants had
expected. Over the weeks following the November meeting, yields on nominal Treasury
securities increased, as investors reportedly revised down their estimates of the ultimate
size of the FOMC’s new Treasury purchase program. Late in the intermeeting period,
yields ratcheted higher on news of the tentative agreement between the Administration
and the Congress regarding a package of fiscal measures that include the extension of
current tax rates and unemployment benefits, as well as additional tax cuts.
All told, yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities rose about 25 basis points
over the intermeeting period, and 5- and 10-year yields were both up about 55 basis
points. Market-based measures of uncertainty about longer-term yields also picked up
s
t
n
notably, apparently contributing to an increase in term premiums. Indeed, staff models
e
m
p suggest that higher term premiums account for a large fraction of the rise in the 10-year
o
l
e yield. Market participants indicated that the backup in rates was amplified by decisions
v
e
D of leveraged investors to unwind long Treasury positions put in place before the last
l
a
i FOMC meeting; anecdotal reports suggest that convexity hedging flows also may have
c
n
a contributed to the rise in rates. The spread between the 30- and 10-year Treasury yields
n
i
F peaked at its highest level in more than 30 years early in the period and then fell back,
evidently reflecting changing views about the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program
(see the box “Long-Term Treasury Yields”).
1 The Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York purchased about $107 billion of
Treasury securities over the period, reflecting both purchases under the new asset purchase program and
reinvestment of principal payments on Federal Reserve holdings of agency MBS and agency debt. The
effective federal funds rate averaged 19 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the intraday
standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
Long‐Term Treasury Yields
In the few months leading up to the November FOMC meeting the spread between
30‐ and 10‐year nominal Treasury yields increased notably, on net, reaching its highest
level in more than 30 years in the week following the November FOMC announcement, as
shown in the figure below. Since November 10, however, the spread has declined
considerably, largely reflecting a sizable backup in 10‐year yields. The large swings in this
spread appear to have reflected importantly the effects of changes in investors’
expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury securities and long‐
term inflation.
The table on the next page provides some perspective on the recent changes in the
spread between 30‐ and 10‐year nominal Treasury yields by decomposing the changes in
yields from September 20 to December 7 into changes in 1‐year forward rates across the
curve over three sub‐periods. From September 20 to November 10 (columns 5 and 6),
nominal 1‐year forward rates in the 2‐ to 7‐year sector dropped significantly, while those
at longer horizons recorded sharp increases. This pattern of changes in forward rates
seems consistent with anecdotal reports suggesting that investors had become
increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve would conduct additional Treasury
purchases in the 2‐ to 10‐year sector. The increase in forward rates at horizons between
10 and 30 years was reinforced by the November FOMC statement and by the
accompanying statement from the Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York that pointed to a smaller‐than‐expected allocation of new Treasury purchases to
securities with maturities greater than 10 years.1

Before the November FOMC meeting, some market commentaries indicated that the share of
total asset purchases in the 10‐ to 30‐year sector was expected to be about 15 percent. In contrast, on
November 3, simultaneous with the release of the FOMC statement, the Trading Desk at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York announced that the 10‐ to 30‐year sector would receive only a 6 percent
allocation of the total intended purchases.
Page 52 of 100

--- Page 56 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
In response to those statements, the 30‐year nominal Treasury yield increased 14 basis
points while the 10‐year yield was about unchanged. The shift in investor sentiment away
from the 30‐year bond seemed to carry over to the auction of that security conducted on
November 10, which was not very well received. On net, as shown in column 6 in the
table above, forward rates at horizons of 15 to 20 years increased 80 to 90 basis points
during the period from the day before the November FOMC meeting to November 10.
However, since November 10 (column 7), 1‐year forward rates in the 2‐ to 7‐year range
have risen sharply, apparently as investors have reassessed the ultimate scale of
additional Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securities and reacted to the potential
bipartisan agreement on tax cuts announced on the evening of December 6. At the same
time, forward rates further out the term structure have declined substantially, except in
the 25‐ to 30‐year sector, where rates more than retraced their declines on December 7.
s

Changes in the outlook for inflation at e

contributed to the recent behavior of the e l

inflation compensation, the red line. That
pattern could suggest that confidence in the
Federal Reserve’s ability and commitment to
move inflation back, over time, close to
mandate‐consistent levels increased through
early November, boosting longer‐term
inflation compensation. However, greater
uncertainty about the ultimate impact of
Federal Reserve asset purchases on inflation
may have tempered that confidence more
recently.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
The rise in nominal Treasury yields was accompanied by sizable increases in real
yields, with 5- and 10-year TIPS yields up about 35 basis points and 50 basis points,
respectively. TIPS-based inflation compensation moved up about 20 basis points at the
5-year horizon, amid rising energy prices, but only edged higher 5 to 10 years ahead.
Swaps-based measures of inflation compensation moved about in line with their TIPS
counterparts. On net for the period, survey-based measures of short-term inflation
expectations also rose slightly, while longer-term survey expectations were unchanged.
Based on the staff’s standard term premium adjustment, futures quotes indicate
that the path for the federal funds rate currently expected by market participants starts to
increase around the beginning of 2012 and rises to about 85 basis points by the end of
that year, a 45 basis point increase since the time of the November FOMC meeting.
Quotes on interest rate caps suggest that the modal path of the federal funds rate also
moved up over the intermeeting period and now rises above the current target range at the
end of 2012, three quarters earlier than at the time of the November meeting. However,
staff analysis indicates that term premiums at the short end of the curve increased over
the intermeeting period, consistent with higher near-term uncertainty about monetary
policy. As a result, the revision in the anticipated policy path may be smaller than that
implied by our usual measures of policy expectations.
s Results from the latest survey of primary dealers provide some additional
t
n
e
m evidence of an increase in term premiums, as respondents indicated that the expected path
p
o of the federal funds rate was little changed since the October survey.2 Median

Broad stock price indexes increased about 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting
period. Equity prices rose sharply following the FOMC policy announcement, but these
gains were more than reversed over the subsequent two weeks amid renewed concerns
about the strength of the global economy—prompted by the fiscal situation in Europe and
the announcement of policy tightening by China—and criticism of the announced

expansion of the FOMC’s asset purchase program. However, more recently, equity
prices have strengthened on incoming economic data that were read by investors as
suggesting that the recovery could be gaining traction, at least outside the housing sector.
Stock prices for domestic commercial banks have been volatile since the November
FOMC meeting but, on net, have outperformed broad indexes. Option-implied volatility
on the S&P 500 index fell modestly over the period, and the spread between the staff’s
estimate of the expected real return on equity for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year
Treasury yield—a rough measure of the equity risk premium—narrowed a bit, although it
remained elevated relative to longer-run norms.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose about in line with those on
comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving their spreads about flat; spreads on
speculative-grade bonds moved down somewhat. Secondary-market prices for leveraged
loans rose slightly over the intermeeting period, while bid-asked spreads in that market
continued to drift down.
Some signs of modest stress emerged in certain short-term funding markets over
the intermeeting period as investors focused increasingly on the evolving situation in
Europe, where some further credit tiering has reportedly occurred. The spread of the
three-month forward rate agreement over the three-month forward overnight index swap
s (OIS) rate moved somewhat higher, perhaps pointing to heightened concerns about future
t
n
e
m funding conditions. In the commercial paper (CP) market, spreads on paper issued by
p
o financial institutions with parents in Europe increased, and spreads on asset-backed CP
l
e
v were somewhat volatile, particularly for conduits sponsored by nonbank institutions.
e
D
Nonetheless, spreads on A2/P2-rated nonfinancial CP remained at low levels. In
l
a
i
c addition, spreads of one- and three-month dollar Libor over OIS rates continued to be
n
a
n low, interest rates and haircuts on repurchase agreements were little changed across
i
F
collateral types, and there have been no indications of widespread funding pressures over
year-end.
In the December 2010 SCOOS, dealers reported an easing of credit terms over the
past three months with respect to securities financing transactions and with respect to a
range of counterparties, including hedge funds and other private pools of capital,
insurance companies and other institutional investors, and nonfinancial firms. More
aggressive competition from other institutions and an improvement in the current or
expected financial strength of counterparties were frequently cited reasons for the
Page 56 of 100

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
loosening of terms. Dealers also noted that demand for funding of all types of securities
had increased over the past three months.
Recent conversations with market participants indicated that many leveraged
investors reportedly reduced their risk positions after the announcement of additional
asset purchases by the FOMC at the November meeting, a trend that continued during the
month as a consequence of press accounts of investigations centered around possible
insider trading by hedge funds and their advisors and a rise in uncertainty concerning the
European situation. Lately, however, there have been some indications that leveraged
investors have reestablished risk positions in certain markets, such as the equity market.
BUSINESS FINANCE
Net debt financing of nonfinancial corporations continued to be robust in
November. Gross issuance of corporate bonds was extraordinarily heavy, particularly
for speculative-grade firms. Over recent months, investor demand for syndicated
leveraged loans also appears to have remained high, as reflected in a significant volume
of deals moving through the pipeline and in a trend toward greater leverage embedded in
these deals, albeit from a relatively low base. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on
banks’ books expanded modestly, on balance, in October and November after running off
again in the third quarter. Nonfinancial CP outstanding declined notably during October
s
t
and November, in part as some nonfinancial firms reportedly shifted to bond financing. n
e
m
p
o
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms through seasoned and initial l
e
v
public offerings (IPOs) was particularly strong in November, boosted by GM’s well- e
D
received IPO as well as a number of secondary issues. In the third quarter, equity a l
i
c
retirements increased, as both share repurchases and cash-financed mergers and n
a
n
acquisitions picked up. As a result, net equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations is i
F
estimated to have dipped deeper into negative territory in that period. Announcements of
mergers and new share repurchase programs suggest a further increase in the pace of
equity retirements in the fourth quarter.
According to the BEA’s preliminary estimate, U.S. corporate profits rose about
3 percent in the third quarter (not at an annual rate), close to the increase seen in the
second quarter. In the third quarter, operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms also
rose about 3 percent and were more than 30 percent above their year-earlier levels. The

mid-November reading showed that analysts revised up slightly their expectations for the
year-ahead earnings of S&P 500 firms.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations has continued to improve. The
aggregate ratio of debt to assets for such firms declined a bit further in the third quarter,
and the aggregate liquid asset ratio rose again, reaching its highest level in more than
20 years. Upgrades by Moody’s Investors Service of nonfinancial corporate bonds
outnumbered downgrades again in both October and November. The six-month trailing
bond default rate for nonfinancial firms remained near historical lows in October, and the
KMV expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms, while still somewhat
elevated, moved a bit lower in November.
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained tight. Commercial
mortgage debt is estimated to have declined at an annual rate of about 8 percent in the
third quarter, and the delinquency rates for securitized commercial mortgages and those
for existing properties held at commercial banks increased further. Meanwhile, the share
of commercial properties sold at a nominal loss moved higher in October. However,
there continued to be some modest signs of improvement. According to the CoStar
repeat-sales index, prices of commercial real estate changed little, on balance, over
September and October and have held in a relatively narrow range since the spring, after
having dropped sharply over the preceding two years. Also, issuance of commercial s
t
n
mortgage-backed securities increased in November and is likely to reach $10 billion in e
m
p
2010, up from $1.3 billion in 2009 but still far below pre-crisis levels. o

Mortgage rates rose considerably over the intermeeting period, though not by n

quite as much as rates on longer-term Treasury securities. According to weekly data i
F
from Freddie Mac, the average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages
climbed to 4½ percent by the end of November. More recent daily data indicate that
mortgage rates have increased further since then, bringing the rise over the intermeeting
period as a whole to nearly ½ percentage point. Refinancing activity declined in response
to the higher mortgage rates, likely easing the pressures at mortgage lenders seen earlier
this year. As a result, the spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields dropped back,
reversing the spread widening that had occurred over the preceding several months.

According to the repeat-sales index from CoreLogic, house prices fell in October
for the fifth consecutive month, leaving the index down about 6 percent since May. The
house price declines this summer and fall have more than retraced the increases seen in
2009 and the first half of 2010. The house price indexes from the Federal Housing
Finance Agency and S&P/Case-Shiller also declined in September, albeit at more
subdued paces. House prices continue to be weighed down by the large inventory of
unsold homes, tight mortgage credit, and sluggish demand for housing. In addition, the
drop in house prices since the spring likely has been amplified by an increase in the share
of sales involving distressed properties.
Outstanding residential mortgage debt is estimated to have contracted at an annual
rate of roughly 3 percent in the third quarter, about the average rate of decline seen over
the preceding year. To date, the issues surrounding the reported foreclosure improprieties
by some financial institutions appear to have had little effect on house prices and
mortgage financing activity. The serious delinquency rate on prime mortgages ticked
down in October but remained extremely elevated; delinquencies on subprime mortgages,
available through September, have declined a bit from their peak but also remain
exceptionally high.
In contrast, the consumer credit market has exhibited continued signs of
stabilization. Although consumer credit contracted in the third quarter, the decline was s
t
n
the smallest since late 2008, and nonrevolving credit expanded modestly; in October, top- e
m
p
line consumer credit edged higher. The pace of consumer ABS issuance in November o
l
e
was a shade above the average for the year to date, mostly due to $6 billion of auto ABS v
e
D
issuance. The delinquency rate on consumer loans at banks continued to decline in the
l
a
third quarter, as did delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans held outside the c i
n
a
banking sector. Overall, the improvement in credit quality for consumer loans has been n
i
F
substantially greater than that for mortgage debt. In this environment, the number of
credit card offers mailed to households has moved up considerably over the course of the
year.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Over the intermeeting period, international financial markets reacted primarily to
renewed concerns about fiscal and financial strains in the euro area, shifts in views about
U.S. monetary policy, and fears that policy tightening by Chinese authorities may slow
global growth. Against this backdrop, the dollar appreciated broadly, sovereign bond

yields rose, and equity markets were mixed in both advanced and emerging market
economies.
After depreciating immediately following the FOMC’s November 3
announcement of further asset purchases, the dollar appreciated over the remainder of the
intermeeting period. Intensifying concerns about stresses in the euro area were an
important factor behind this reversal, but investor reassessment of the monetary policy
outlook in the United States also played a role. On net, the broad dollar index rose about
1½ percent over the period, with the dollar up almost 5¼ percent against the euro. The
announcement of an €85 billion financial aid package for Ireland on November 28 did
little to stem the depreciation of the euro. (See the box “Developments in Ireland and the
Euro-Area Periphery” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section.)
Indeed, the pace of dollar appreciation picked up as investors grew increasingly
concerned about market pressures potentially spreading to other euro-area countries and
the adequacy of resources available to support stressed European economies. Spreads
over German bunds of sovereign yields in some peripheral euro-area countries rose to
new highs, although they have fallen back in the past week amid reports that the
European Central Bank (ECB) has increased its purchases of Irish and Portuguese
sovereign debt. Financial pressures on some countries in emerging Europe also
increased, in particular for Hungary, which saw its credit rating downgraded by Moody’s
s
late in the period. t
n
e
m
p
Banks in the euro-area periphery continued to rely heavily on the weekly and o
l
e
longer-term funding operations of the ECB, and overnight borrowing from the ECB v
e
D
increased over the period despite the penalty rate charged. In addition, there were some
l
a
signs of increased dollar funding pressures for European banks, with the implied basis c i
n
a
spread from euro-dollar swaps rising about 15 basis points, on net, although there was no n
i
F
increase in the demand for dollar liquidity in the ECB’s regular dollar tender operations.
Concerns about the euro-area periphery prompted a shift down in implied future
short-term interest rates in the euro area, as market participants scaled back somewhat the
pace at which they expect the ECB to normalize policy. Reinforcing those expectations,
the ECB announced on December 2 that it will continue to conduct refinancing
operations with terms of up to three months as fixed-rate, full-allotment tenders through
at least the first quarter of 2011. Although European concerns sparked flight-to-safety
flows into benchmark sovereign bonds late in the period, 10-year sovereign yields still
Page 63 of 100

--- Page 67 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
increased 25 to 45 basis points, on net, in the advanced foreign economies. The
reassessment of the monetary policy outlook in the United States and the related rise in
U.S. yields may have contributed to the rise in foreign yields, but there was also some
reduction of the perceived likelihood of further quantitative easing in the United
Kingdom, where the Bank of England (BOE) released a better-than-expected growth
outlook for the U.K. economy. The BOE and the Bank of Japan made no changes to their
main policy rates during the period.
Major headline equity indexes were mixed over the period. Japan’s Nikkei index
rose notably, as improved corporate earnings and a pause in the yen’s rally helped boost
equities. In the euro area, equity prices were little changed, on net, while bank stocks
declined almost 10 percent amid the area’s financial turmoil.
Monetary policy tightening in some emerging Asian economies weighed upon
global stock prices within the intermeeting period. The People’s Bank of China raised
the required reserve ratio for banks a cumulative 100 basis points over the period.
Chinese authorities also announced that they were discussing possible price-control
measures to counter rising inflation. In addition, the Bank of Korea and the Reserve
Bank of India increased policy rates. China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell in the wake
of Chinese policy actions, while emerging market stock indexes in general were mixed
s over the period. In Latin America, Brazil’s central bank also raised reserve requirements
t
n
e
m late in the period to mop up liquidity.
p
o
l
e Capital flows to emerging market economies, although appearing to moderate
v
e
D
over the intermeeting period, continued to prompt exchange market intervention and
l
a
i capital control measures. (See “Capital Flows to Emerging Market Economies” in the
c
n
a International Economic Developments and Outlook section.) Many emerging market
n
i
F
economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey, were reported to have
intervened to stem the appreciation of their currencies. Taiwan and Turkey took concrete
actions to discourage certain inflows deemed to be speculative, while authorities in
Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand announced that they were contemplating similar
steps. The Chinese renminbi appreciated slightly, on net, against the dollar over the
period, but the dollar appreciated against most other emerging market currencies.
While foreign official investors made sizable purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities in October, partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York show weaker purchases of Treasury securities in November.
Page 64 of 100

--- Page 68 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) December 8, 2010
This slowing of purchases likely reflects the appreciation of the dollar in November,
which may have reduced foreign officials’ desire to purchase dollars in foreign exchange
markets to stem appreciation of their currencies, and perhaps some slackening of private
capital flows to emerging markets. Foreign private investors increased their net
purchases of U.S. agency bonds and corporate stocks.
GOVERNMENT FINANCE
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned $203 billion of nominal
coupon securities across the maturity spectrum and $10 billion of 10-year TIPS, with
offer amounts unchanged from previous auctions. These auctions were generally well
received, with bid-to-cover ratios in a range around recent averages.3
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was very high in November, mostly
driven by issuance of Build America Bonds, as the program approaches its scheduled
expiration at year-end. Short-term issuance also picked up, largely because of $10 billion
of revenue anticipation notes issued by California. Amid the bulge in issuance, yields on
municipal bonds rose sharply during November and increased further early this month,
though the latest rise was smaller than the jump in Treasury yields. The ratio of yields on
long-term municipal bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities rose
markedly before falling back somewhat.

COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY

Bank credit was about flat, on average, over October and November. Banks v

continued to increase their holdings of securities, albeit at a much slower pace than in the

third quarter, with noticeable declines in Treasury securities posted by some large banks c
n
a
in recent weeks. Core loans decreased at an average annual rate of about 3 percent n
i
F
during October and November, continuing the trend toward slower runoffs that has been
evident since midyear. The declines in October and November were attributable to a
drop in consumer loans that was concentrated in credit card loans, as well as continued
runoffs in commercial real estate and home equity loans. Conversely, reported
originations of closed-end residential mortgages were robust, and banks’ holdings of such
loans have increased moderately for four consecutive months. In addition, C&I loans

Total federal debt subject to the debt limit increased to $13.78 trillion over the intermeeting period, and
staff projections indicate that the debt limit may be reached as early as the end of the first quarter of 2011,
though the precise timing depends on Treasury operations. To date, markets have not focused on this issue.

edged up in both October and November, on a month-average basis, ending a string of
monthly declines dating back to the fall of 2008.
Other information about business lending at banks has been mixed. The Survey
of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of November showed that both
the weighted-average interest rate and the spread on C&I loans of less than $25 million
edged down in the survey week, although the spread remains extremely wide. In
addition, according to the Call Report, unused commitments to fund C&I loans increased
in the third quarter, especially at large banks; the available data suggest that these
commitments had fallen continually for at least the preceding two years. However, C&I
loans with original amounts less than $1 million, a proxy for loans to small businesses,
continued to decline last quarter, and unused business credit card lines—another
important source of financing for small businesses—expanded only modestly.
According to the third-quarter Call Report data, bank profitability was little
changed last quarter, remaining positive but well below pre-crisis levels. As in the
second quarter, banks’ net incomes were supported by declines in loan loss provisioning,
while revenue declined. Delinquency rates were down or about flat for all loan
categories, with significant declines for consumer credit card and C&I loans. Charge-off
rates on credit card loans also dropped appreciably.
Banks continued to boost regulatory capital ratios, likely, at least in part, because
of the need to eventually meet stricter Basel III standards. Capital ratios also have been
partially supported by restrictions on banks’ dividend payments that were put in place in
early 2009, but some banks are reportedly positioning themselves to pay dividends in
coming quarters.4

e In November, M2 expanded at an annual rate of 5 percent, somewhat below its
m
p pace in October. Over the past several months, M2 has grown more than would have
o
e l been predicted based on its relationship with nominal GDP and opportunity costs, but the
v
e deviation has not been large compared with historical model errors for M2 growth.
D
l Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, continued to grow rapidly in November,
a
i
c while the contraction in small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds
n
n a persisted.5 The ongoing compositional shift toward liquid deposits likely reflects the
i
F extremely low interest rates available on all M2 assets, including those that provide less
safety and liquidity. In November, currency grew at an annual rate of about 10 percent,
with indicators suggesting particularly robust demand from abroad. The monetary base
increased at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in November (see the box “Balance Sheet
Developments over the Intermeeting Period”).
4 On November 17, the Federal Reserve Board issued guidelines for evaluating proposals by large bank
holding companies to undertake capital actions in 2011, such as increasing dividend payments or
repurchasing or redeeming stock.
5 Transaction deposits grew rapidly in November because of a four-day suspension of the retail sweeps
program at one large commercial bank in order to allow system maintenance to be performed. Total liquid
deposits were unaffected by the event, as the suspension resulted in an equivalent decrease in savings
deposits.

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period
Total assets of the Federal Reserve edged up to almost $2.4 trillion over the
intermeeting period (see table). In line with FOMC policy, total securities
holdings rose $69 billion, as Treasury purchases outpaced runoffs of agency debt
and agency mortgage‐backed securities.
The Trading Desk at the FRBNY conducted a number of operations to purchase
longer‐term Treasury securities over the intermeeting period. The operations,
which covered a range of maturities for nominal securities as well as one
operation in TIPS, resulted in a $98.5 billion increase in Treasury securities
holdings.1 The Desk has temporarily relaxed its 35 percent per issue limit on
SOMA holdings of individual Treasury issues, and holdings of 23 issues now
exceed this limit. The majority of the issues for which the SOMA now holds
greater than 35 percent are 30‐year bonds with remaining maturities between
2 and 10 years. The SOMA's largest ownership concentration is 50 percent, and it
owns this amount of three separate issues, all of which are 30‐year bonds with a
remaining maturity of about 10 years.
Loans outstanding under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)
dropped about $2 billion over the intermeeting period, reflecting prepayments of
TALF loans. Support for specific institutions remained about unchanged.
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the Treasury’s general
s account decreased $36 billion, on net, over the intermeeting period, while the
t
n
e supplementary financing account held steady at $200 billion. The Federal
m
Reserve conducted an additional small‐scale operation under the Term Deposit
p
o Facility; term deposits outstanding remain at about $5 billion. In terms of other
l
e
v Federal Reserve liabilities, Federal Reserve notes in circulation climbed $9 billion,
e
D and reserve balances of depository institutions increased $93 billion.
l
a
i
c
n Finally, on October 29, the FRBNY began to hold, as agent, the cash proceeds
a
n from the disposition of certain assets held by AIG. As announced in AIG’s
i
F
recapitalization plan on September 30, these cash proceeds, which currently
total about $27 billion, will eventually be used to repay the credit facility
extended to AIG by the FRBNY as well as other interests owned by the U.S.
government. These holdings reduce reserve balances by $27 billion.

These figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that have settled. Over the
intermeeting period, the Trading Desk committed to purchase, but has not settled, an
additional $8.9 billion of Treasury securities.

Appendix
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms
Overall, respondents to the December 2010 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on
Dealer Financing Terms indicated an easing in credit terms with respect to counterparty
relationships and securities financing transactions over the previous three months.1 Dealers also
noted an increase in demand for funding for all types of securities considered in the survey. By
contrast, respondents reported little change in the terms and conditions prevalent in over-the-
counter (OTC) derivatives markets over the reference period.2
 Dealers indicated that they had loosened credit terms offered to each of the distinct
classes of counterparties—including hedge funds and other private pools of capital,
insurance companies and other institutional investors, and nonfinancial firms—
considering all transaction types covered in the survey. More aggressive competition
from other institutions and an improvement in the current or expected financial strength
of counterparties were frequently cited reasons for the loosening of terms. As in the
September survey, respondents also noted an increase in the intensity of efforts by clients
in each major class to negotiate more-favorable terms.
 Similar to the September survey, only a few respondents indicated that they had increased
the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated credit
exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries. The pattern observed in the
September and December surveys represents a notable shift from the June survey in
s
t
which more than half the respondents reported an increase in the resources and attention n
e
m
devoted to the management of concentrated credit exposures.
p
o
l
e
v
e
1 The December survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in D
l
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. In a
i
c
addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about changes since the n
a
beginning of 2010 in demand for, and respondents’ willingness to fund, high-yield corporate bonds; a n
i
second set of special questions focused on demand for, and respondents’ willingness to fund, exposures to F
syndicated leveraged loans through total return swaps (TRS) during the same period; and a final set of
special questions regarding respondents’ assessments of the effects of recent legal uncertainties
surrounding legacy residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The 20 institutions participating in the
survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to nondealers and are
the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was conducted during the period
from November 15, 2010, to November 26, 2010. The core questions ask about changes between
September 2010 and November 2010.
2 For questions that ask about credit terms, reported net percentages equal the percentage of institutions
that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably” or “tightened somewhat”) minus the percentage of
institutions that reported easing terms (“eased considerably” or “eased somewhat”). For questions that ask
about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions that reported increased demand
(“increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions that reported
decreased demand (“decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”).

 As in the September survey, responses to questions about OTC derivatives transactions
suggested that nonprice terms were little changed across different types of underlying
asset classes (underlyings), considering both plain and customized derivatives.
 With respect to securities financing transactions, respondents reported an easing of some
terms applicable to the funding of most types of collateral considered in the survey.
Dealers also noted that demand for funding of all types of securities had increased over
the past three months, including demand for funding of equities, which was reported
largely unchanged in the September survey.
 Responses to special questions about the funding of high-yield corporate bonds pointed to
an increase in demand for funding relative to the beginning of 2010, particularly on the
part of private pools of capital and, to a lesser extent, dealers (and other financial
intermediaries). Responses to special questions about total return swaps (TRS)
referencing syndicated leveraged loans also pointed to an increase in demand for these
instruments, especially by private pools of capital and, to a lesser extent, dealers (and
other financial intermediaries) and insurance companies, pension funds, and other
institutional investors.
 With respect to the supply of such funding, the majority of respondents indicated that
their willingness to expand financing of high-yield corporate bonds or the provision of
exposure to syndicated leveraged loans through TRS at prevailing market rates and under
prevailing market terms had remained basically unchanged.
s  Dealer responses to special questions regarding the effects of recent legal uncertainties
t
n
e relating to improper handling of foreclosure documents, compliance with securitization
m

As in the September survey, the vast majority of respondents reported that the amount of
resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other
financial intermediaries had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, with only
three institutions pointing to an increase. These responses contrast with those to the June survey,
also conducted during a period of heightened concern about European financial conditions, in
which over one-half of dealers reported an increase. The vast majority of respondents also noted
that the volume of mark and collateral disputes with dealers and other financial intermediaries, a
rise in which is generally viewed as a leading indicator of market stress, had remained basically
unchanged over the previous three months.

Hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar pools of capital
Consistent with the September survey, the responses indicated that, across all types of
transactions covered in the survey, dealers provided somewhat more-favorable credit terms over
the past three months to hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar private pools of
capital (private pools of capital). One-fourth of respondents, on net, eased price terms, which
include most importantly financing rates. Nearly one-half of institutions, on net, reported having
eased nonprice terms, which include haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods, and
cross-default provisions or other documentation features. The institutions that reported an easing
of terms pointed to more aggressive competition from other institutions, an improvement in the
current or expected financial strength of counterparties, and an improvement in general market
liquidity and functioning as the main reasons for the changes.3 More than one-half of the
respondents to the December survey noted an increase in the intensity of efforts by private pools
of capital to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.
Looking forward over the next three months, most dealers expected price and nonprice terms
applicable to private pools of capital to remain basically unchanged, while a small net fraction of
respondents indicated that they anticipate an easing of terms.
Insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors
The survey responses indicated that dealers also provided more-favorable credit terms for
insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors (institutional investors). A
small net fraction of respondents reported having eased price and nonprice terms over the past
three months. No respondents reported tightening either price or nonprice terms. The most
important reason indicated for easing terms was more aggressive competition from other
institutions. Improvements in current or expected financial strength of counterparties were also s
t

cited. One-half of the dealers reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by institutional e
m
investors to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months. p

easing terms was an increased willingness of institutions to take on risk. The other factors cited

past three months included more aggressive competition from other institutions, improvements in
general market liquidity and functioning, adoption of less stringent market conventions, and

respondents characterizing each reason as “very important” to the number characterizing the reason as
“somewhat important” and then sorting the sums in descending order. For reasons with the same ranking
based on the sums, the response that the greater number of dealers characterizes as “very important” takes
priority.

improvements in the current or expected financial strength of counterparties. More than one-third
of respondents indicated that there had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial
corporations to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.
Looking forward over the next three months, the majority of dealers noted that they expected
credit terms to remain basically unchanged, while a small net fraction of respondents indicated
that they anticipate somewhat looser terms.
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES
As in the previous two surveys, responses to questions dealing with OTC derivatives
trades pointed to little change over the past three months in the terms for “plain vanilla” and
customized derivatives across the various underlyings—foreign exchange, interest rates, equities,
credit, commodities, and total return swaps referencing nonsecurities (such as bank and whole
loans). Of note, there was no indication in responses to the December survey of an increase in
mark and collateral disputes with respect to OTC foreign exchange derivatives as was reported in
the September survey. However, small net portions of respondents active in the OTC interest rate
and OTC equity derivatives markets continued to report an increase in the volume of such
disputes with respect to contracts referencing those underlyings.
SECURITIES FINANCING
As in the previous survey, responses to questions that were focused on securities
financing pointed to an easing of some terms under which a broad spectrum of securities were
being funded.4 This reported loosening of terms was generally evident for both average clients
and most-favored clients. With regard to terms under which high-grade corporate bonds are
s funded, net shares of survey respondents ranging between 20 and 40 percent reported an
t
n
e extension in the maximum maturity, an increase in the maximum amount of funding, and a
m
p decrease in haircuts. With respect to terms under which equities are funded (including through
o
e l repo-like stock loan transactions), net fractions of dealers ranging between 10 and 25 percent
v
e indicated that they had extended the maximum maturity, increased the maximum amount of
D
l funding, and decreased the financing rate. Regarding terms under which agency RMBS are
a
i
c funded, net portions of respondents ranging between 22 and 28 percent noted that they had
n
a extended the maximum maturity and increased the maximum amount of funding. Finally, with
n
i
F respect to terms under which ABS other than agency RMBS are funded, net fractions of dealers
ranging between 15 and 31 percent reported an extension in the maximum maturity, an increase
in the maximum amount of funding, a decline in financing rates, and a loosening of covenants
and triggers.
Survey respondents indicated that demand for funding for all types of securities
considered in the survey had increased over the past three months. The net fractions of
respondents that noted an increase in demand were similar to those in the September survey; the
only exception was the share of dealers that reported an increase in demand for funding of
4 In this survey, securities financing includes lending to clients collateralized by high-grade corporate
bonds, equities, agency RMBS, and other ABS.

equities, which was considerably higher. On balance, about 30 percent of dealers that lend
against agency RMBS, ABS other than agency RMBS, and equities reported an increase in
demand for funding in the December survey, while one-fifth of survey respondents that lend
against high-grade corporate bonds indicated that demand for funding had increased.
Respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning in several markets had improved
over the past three months.5 More than 40 percent of dealers reported an improvement in markets
for ABS other than agency RMBS, while a similar fraction of respondents noted an improvement
in the high-grade corporate bond market. By contrast, the vast majority of dealers indicated that
liquidity and functioning in the agency RMBS market had remained basically unchanged.
Survey respondents generally reported that the volume of collateral and mark disputes
with clients related to the funding of collateral of all types had remained basically unchanged.
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON THE FUNDING OF HIGH-YIELD CORPORATE BONDS
In response to special questions about the funding of high-yield corporate bonds, one-
third of dealers active in this market, on net, noted an increase in the demand for funding relative
to the beginning of 2010. In explaining the reported change in demand, respondents cited the
behavior of private pools of capital and, to a lesser extent, dealers (and other financial
intermediaries) as important. The majority of respondents reported that their willingness to fund
high-yield corporate bonds at prevailing market rates and under prevailing market terms had
remained basically unchanged.

Risks and Uncertainty
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we consider a number of alternatives
to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first scenario, we
consider the possibility that the economy will recover more vigorously than we expect.
The second scenario considers the contrasting risk of an even more sluggish recovery in
aggregate demand than we are projecting. We then turn to opposing risks to the inflation
outlook—that we will experience the more-pronounced disinflation predicted by some of
the staff’s reduced-form models or, alternatively, that concerns about the System’s large
balance sheet and the long-run fiscal outlook in the United States will push inflation
much higher than in the baseline. The final two scenarios consider risks of recession in
Europe, including potential financial spillover effects to the United States and our major
non-European trading partners.
In the alternative scenarios, monetary policy responds to movements in real
activity and inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule for the federal funds rate,
while nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the baseline path. We generate the first
four scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated policy rule. The last two
scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different
policy rule for the federal funds rate that employs an alternative concept of resource
utilization.1
Stronger Recovery
The baseline projection shows the recovery picking up speed gradually in coming
quarters. But both household and business spending may gather steam more rapidly than
we anticipate, reflecting a mutually reinforcing dynamic of improved optimism, higher
spending, greater hiring, and increasing credit availability. This scenario examines the
consequences of a snapback in outlays on consumer durables, housing, and business

1 For FRB/US, the federal funds rate follows the “outcome-based” rule, described in the appendix on U

policy rules in Book B. In the case of SIGMA, its rule is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack that is

the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the k

absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices. R i

of pronounced cyclical rebound typically seen after deep recessions. The resulting
stronger activity and improved optimism also buoy financial markets and push equity
prices 12 percent above baseline by the end of next year; financial conditions improve
further into 2012. This virtuous circle causes real GDP to expand 5¼ percent in both
2011 and 2012, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7 percent by late 2012. With
less slack, inflation is higher; however, the upward pressure is partially checked by more
capital deepening, and thus by larger productivity gains, which hold down unit labor
costs. Under these conditions, the federal funds rate begins to rise in late 2011 and
remains above baseline thereafter.
Weaker Recovery
Ongoing financial headwinds and lingering uncertainty could restrain consumer
and business confidence more than we expect. Moreover, impaired credit conditions may
be muting the stimulative effect of low interest rates on household and business spending
more than we have assumed. In this scenario, the modest expected improvements in
confidence, credit conditions, and the labor market underlying our baseline projection are
delayed even further. As a result, the personal saving rate climbs to 7¾ percent by the
end of 2012 and firms are more reluctant to boost capital spending. In this environment,
house prices fall 10 percent relative to baseline over the next two years, and residential
investment is essentially flat; in addition, financial market participants reassess the
outlook for earnings and the riskiness of holding equities, causing share prices to fall
about 7 percent relative to baseline by late next year. Real GDP expands only 2¼ percent
next year and labor market conditions stagnate, so that the unemployment rate hovers a
bit below 9½ percent through the end of 2012. Inflation falls in response to more-
persistent slack and remains below baseline through 2015. Liftoff of the federal funds
rate from its effective lower bound is delayed until the second half of 2014.
Greater Disinflation
In the baseline, inflation remains relatively stable over the next two years and then
begins to rise as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation

continuing to fall, the perceived riskiness of holding bonds is assumed to increase. As a
result, bond term premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long-term interest rates,
thereby modestly damping spending and boosting unemployment relative to baseline over
the next few years. In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal
funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until the middle of 2014. In the longer
run, monetary policy is sufficiently stimulative to eventually bring the unemployment
rate below baseline and to check the deflationary pressure.
Higher Inflation
The extraordinary expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the
deterioration of the long-run fiscal outlook in the United States carry a risk of putting
upward pressure on expected, and hence actual, inflation. Indeed, some commentators
have viewed the rise in commodity prices over the past year as a harbinger of such a
development. In this scenario, inflation expectations move up markedly over the next
two years, creating a situation in which actual inflation shifts up to 3 percent within a few
years. In addition, the unmooring of long-run expectations is assumed to be accompanied
by greater uncertainty about future inflation prospects, and thus higher term premiums on
long-term interest rates. The latter development, in conjunction with an earlier and more
pronounced rise in the federal funds rate in response to higher inflation, results in tighter
financial conditions that noticeably slow the pace of the economic recovery over time.
Mild European Recession
In the baseline forecast, we project that the European economies will expand at a
modest pace next year. In this scenario, we assume that financial stress in Europe
intensifies and pushes Europe into a mild recession by early next year. Specifically,
European real GDP falls about 2 percent relative to baseline in 2011 as sovereign and
private borrowing costs rise, notwithstanding a depreciation of the euro of about
10 percent against the dollar. In response to the stronger dollar and weaker foreign
activity, real net exports decline in the United States. These developments cause U.S.
real GDP to expand more slowly over the next two years, leaving the unemployment rate
y
t
n
about ¼ percentage point above baseline by the end of 2012. Core inflation in the United
i
a
t
e r States is ¼ percentage point below baseline in 2011 and 2012, reflecting both lower
c
n
import prices and greater resource slack. With lower inflation and greater slack, the
U
& federal funds rate runs a bit below baseline after a liftoff in early 2013; the easier stance

of monetary policy, coupled with a gradual improvement in European conditions,
provides support to economic activity in the longer run.
Severe European Recession with Contagion
In this scenario, we assume a much larger rise in European sovereign and private
yields than in the previous scenario and a considerably larger fall in the euro. Moreover,
the problems in European financial markets are assumed to have pronounced spillover
effects on financial markets in the United States and in our major non-European trading
partners. Specifically, higher European sovereign spreads cause corporate bond spreads
in Europe to rise about 300 basis points by early next year relative to baseline, and
European GDP falls more than 5 percent relative to baseline next year despite a
depreciation of the euro of over 20 percent against the dollar. U.S. net exports are
adversely affected by the stronger dollar and weaker foreign activity, and domestic
demand is restrained by a 50 basis point rise in U.S. corporate bond spreads, a weaker
stock market, and reduced confidence. Altogether, U.S. real GDP growth falls about
1¼ percentage points below baseline in 2011 and about 1 percentage point below
baseline in 2012, and the unemployment rate remains above 9 percent through most of
2012. The greater resource slack, coupled with lower import prices, pushes PCE inflation
down to about ¼ percent in 2011 and 2012. The federal funds rate remains near zero
until late 2013.
OUTSIDE FORECASTS
The last available Blue Chip forecast was released in early November, and hence
is now out of date. However, an updated Blue Chip survey will be released on December
10, and we will circulate a note to the Committee then summarizing its results.
