Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

e
v
e
The information we have received on economic activity since the time of the D
n
April projection—information that largely pertains to a period too early to reflect the o
c
E
influence of the recent turmoil in Europe—suggests that the economic recovery has been
c
i
proceeding at a moderate pace, about as we had anticipated.1 Businesses have been s t
e
m
adding jobs and raising hours across a range of industries, and manufacturing output has o
D
been registering solid and widespread gains. Consumer spending continues to move
higher, and business investment in equipment and software has been rising rapidly. On
the less-favorable side, commercial construction continues to decline, the underlying pace
of economic activity in the housing sector remains anemic, and spending by state and
local governments is still being weighed down by ongoing fiscal pressures. On net, we
are projecting that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the current
quarter after having risen at a 3 percent rate in the first quarter—rates of growth just a
touch faster than we projected in April.
However, because of intensifying concerns about the implications of the fiscal
difficulties faced by some European countries, and the accompanying reaction in
financial markets, some key factors influencing our forecast are now less expansionary
than in our previous projection. Most importantly, the appreciation of the dollar and the
drop in equity prices imply noticeably less demand for domestic production. These
influences are only partially offset by the associated drop in oil prices and the declines in
some interest rates. As a result, we now project real GDP to increase at an annual rate of
3 percent in the second half of this year and 3¾ percent in 2011, about ¾ percentage
point slower during both periods than in the April forecast. With this reduced pace of
output growth, we project the unemployment rate to come down more slowly, only to
9½ percent at the end of this year and to 8½ percent at the end of 2011.
The additional economic slack in this projection, as well as the stronger dollar and
lower level of oil and other commodity prices, all work in the direction of lowering the
inflation projection relative to the April forecast. However, with inflation expectations
remaining well anchored, we have reduced our inflation forecast only slightly in response
to these influences. Thus, we now project that core PCE prices will rise about ¾ percent

m Monetary Policy
o
D We continue to assume that the FOMC will hold the target federal funds rate in
the current range of 0 to ¼ percent through the end of next year. Indeed, given the
weaker economic outlook and lower inflation in this projection, we have pushed back the
date at which the FOMC begins to raise the target for short-term interest rates until the
summer of 2012, about one-half year later than in the April forecast. In terms of
nontraditional policy actions, we now assume that the Federal Reserve will begin selling
agency debt and MBS at a gradual pace at the beginning of 2013. Thus, compared with
the April forecast, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is projected to be somewhat
smaller and more concentrated in holdings of Treasury securities, with the most notable
revisions occurring over the longer term. This change in nontraditional policy led us to
make a small upward adjustment to the projected path of longer-term interest rates next
year as market participants are assumed to anticipate some of the effects of future sales.
The 10-year Treasury yield has decreased about 45 basis points since the April
projection was closed. The decline likely reflects both a flight to quality in response to
the European situation and some downward revision to market participants’ expectations
for short-term interest rates. Going forward, we anticipate that the 10-year Treasury yield
will increase about ¾ percentage point to 4¼ percent by the end of 2011. While this
projected path is noticeably lower than in the April forecast, it is also a bit steeper. As
before, the upward tilt reflects the gradual movement of the 10-year valuation window
through the period of near-zero short-term rates and the expectation of further large
increases in Treasury debt in coming years. Moreover, as mentioned, the new balance
sheet projections are expected to result in slightly more upward pressure on Treasury
yields over the medium term.
Financial Conditions
In recent weeks, conforming 30-year mortgage rates have decreased to
4¾ percent, well below our forecast in April. We have lowered the path of mortgage

end of 2011. By contrast, yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds have not changed much

v

D
n The Dow Jones Total U.S. Stock Market Index is nearly 10 percent lower than we
o
c
E had expected in the April projection. We estimate that the equity premium has moved
c
i
t even further above longer-run norms, and we therefore project that stock prices will rise a
s
e
m
bit faster than in the April forecast—at an average annual rate of 17 percent—to help
o
D
bring the equity premium toward a more typical level. Even with this steeper trajectory
for stock prices, the market value of corporate equities averages about $2 trillion lower
over the projection period than we assumed in April.
The recent readings on house prices have been about in line with our expectations
that prices would soften this spring. We continue to assume that house prices, as
measured by the LoanPerformance index, will remain relatively flat on balance, slipping
2½ percent over the course of this year and edging up in 2011. (See the box on house
prices for further discussion of our projection.)
Fiscal Policy
Because recent congressional actions indicate heightened concerns about the
deficit and less appetite for additional stimulus measures, we have made two small
changes to our fiscal policy assumptions. We scaled back the package of additional
grants-in-aid to state and local governments from $35 billion to $25 billion, and we
removed the $12 billion extension of health-insurance subsidies for recently unemployed
individuals (COBRA) that we had assumed previously. Our assumptions regarding other
policies, such as the extension of emergency unemployment benefits, are the same as in
the April forecast. With these two changes, we estimate that federal fiscal policy will add
about ¾ percentage point to real GDP growth (on an annual-average basis) in 2010 and
then will be essentially neutral for GDP growth in 2011. These numbers show only a
touch more restraint than in April.
Our forecast for the unified budget deficit is roughly the same as in April, as the
effect on revenues of the weaker GDP projection is largely offset by small downward
revisions to our path for expenditures. Thus, the deficit still is expected to be about
$1.4 trillion (9¼ percent of GDP) in fiscal 2010 and $1.3 trillion (8½ percent of GDP) in

e The Foreign Outlook and the Dollar
D
n
o The incoming data on economic activity abroad have generally surprised to the
c
E upside, prompting us to revise up our estimates of aggregate foreign economic growth for
c
i
s t the first half of this year. However, we are not carrying this strength forward, as we
e
m
anticipate that stresses in financial markets and associated negative confidence effects
o
D
resulting from the troubles in Europe will weigh on foreign activity. In the euro area in
particular, we have marked down domestic demand substantially, although the effect of
this markdown on euro-area GDP has been offset in part by an upward revision to net
exports, which are boosted as a result of the weaker path of the euro. We now have
foreign growth stepping down from a 4½ percent pace in the first half of this year to a
3¼ percent pace in the second half and next year.
The intensification of concerns about Europe and the potential ramifications for
the rest of the world prompted a widespread retreat from risk that lifted the foreign
exchange value of the dollar is against the euro and most other currencies. Since the
April forecast, the dollar is up about 3½ percent on a trade-weighted basis against a broad
set of currencies. Our outlook is predicated on the working assumption that financial
conditions in Europe and elsewhere will remain strained through most of this year and
will normalize only gradually starting early next year. By then, we expect that vulnerable
European countries will be making some progress implementing their fiscal consolidation
plans and the financial stop-gap measures announced by European leaders will be put in
place. Given these assumptions, the dollar is now projected to remain around current
levels through the end of this year. We anticipate that, as more time passes without
adverse market events, investors will become more comfortable taking on greater risk,
and thus we project that the broad real dollar will begin to give back some of its gains
next year, depreciating at an annual rate of 6 percent. This projection leaves the path for
the dollar above that in the previous forecast by 4½ percent at the end of this year and by
1½ percent at the end of next year.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
Since the April forecast, oil prices have declined. The spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed on June 15 at about $77 per barrel, about
$6.50 lower than at the time of the previous forecast. Prices of futures contracts dated for

delivery through the end of next year have declined, on average, by a similar magnitude. u t
O
In contrast, the far-dated futures price has moved down by less, settling at about $95 per
&
barrel as of June 15 and down just $1.50 since the previous forecast. Market commentary e l
v
e
has largely attributed the recent decline in oil prices to the sovereign debt problems in D
n
Europe and associated concerns that the global recovery may lose some of its momentum. o
c
E
Consistent with futures prices, we now project that the spot price of WTI will rise to
c
i
t
nearly $83 per barrel by the end of 2011, about $7 lower than in the previous forecast. s
e
m
o
D
Likely for the same reasons that generated the fall in oil prices, prices for metals
and agricultural raw materials, especially lumber, have dropped sharply in recent weeks,
leading us to revise down our forecast for nonfuel commodity prices in the third quarter.
By contrast, food prices have registered only modest declines since the previous forecast.
Consistent with quotes from futures markets, we project nonfuel commodity prices to
increase at only a 2 percent pace, on average, for the remainder of the forecast period.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
Much as we had expected in the April forecast, economic activity appears to have
continued to increase moderately and inflation has remained low. Real GDP rose at an
annual rate of about 3 percent in the first quarter, as final sales rose modestly and firms
began to rebuild inventories. In the current quarter, real GDP growth is projected to step
up to a 3½ percent pace as final sales rise more sharply.2 The faster pace of growth this
quarter reflects, in part, some factors that are likely to prove transitory, most notably an
expected rebound in federal defense spending and a jump in residential investment
associated with the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit.
Labor Markets
We have received both the April and May labor market reports since the time of
the April forecast, and the news on labor demand has been reasonably encouraging on the
whole. Although private nonfarm payroll employment rose only 41,000 in May, that
disappointing reading followed sizable increases in March and April.3 Moreover,
2 The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is likely to have serious consequences for important industries (for
example, fishing and tourism) in the affected localities. However, on its current dimensions, the disaster
does not appear likely to register sizable effects at the national level.
3 The hiring of 411,000 temporary workers in May for the decennial census brought the cumulative
level of census hires to about 560,000—close to our previous assumption. We expect the winding down of
the census to subtract about 250,000 workers from government payrolls in June, with the effect on the level
of employment reaching essentially zero by September.

employment gains in the private sector have been increasingly widespread across u t
O
industries over the past few months. In addition, employers have continued to increase
&
workweeks—particularly in manufacturing, where the workweek of production and e l
v
e
nonsupervisory workers reached its highest level since July 2000, and where overtime D
n
hours per worker now stand at pre-recession levels. o
c
E
c
i
Relative to the April projection, the level of private employment in May was close t
s
e
m
to what we had expected. However, we did not anticipate the expansion of the
o
D
workweek, and thus aggregate hours appear on track to post a somewhat larger gain than
we had projected. In response to these developments, we have shifted some of our
projected growth in total hours in the months ahead from employment to the workweek
on the expectation that the ongoing uncertainty about the outlook will lead some
employers to lengthen hours of their existing workers rather than to hire new employees.
Moreover, initial claims for unemployment insurance are still elevated. All told, we now
expect private payrolls to rise 150,000 in June, 75,000 less than in our April projection.
The unemployment rate in both April and May was ¼ percentage point higher
than we projected in the April forecast, stemming in part from higher-than-expected labor
force participation. Given the downward revision we made to the projected pace of
employment growth and the higher level of participation, we now expect the
unemployment rate to hold at 9¾ percent in June, the same as its first-quarter average.
The Industrial Sector
Industrial production has continued to expand solidly, and we expect significant
gains to continue in the near term. With sizable increases in April and May, IP looks on
track to rise at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the second quarter—the fourth consecutive
increase of about this size since its mid-2009 trough.4 In recent months, increases have
been widespread across industries; indeed, the May reading of the diffusion index of
three-month changes in IP reached its highest level since 1987. The available near-term
production indicators, such as the diffusion indexes for new orders from the national ISM
survey and the regional manufacturing surveys, also point to further gains for overall IP
in the coming months.
4 In reaction to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Administration has announced a six-month
moratorium on exploratory deepwater offshore drilling. The reduction in drilling activity is expected to
subtract 0.05 percentage point from the change in total IP in June, and we expect a similarly sized boost
when the moratorium expires. Looking ahead, moratorium-induced delays in bringing new wells online are
expected to reduce crude oil production slightly in late 2010 and in 2011.

u t Household Spending
O
& Growth in consumer spending appears to have moderated this quarter from the
l
e sizable gains posted earlier this year. Real PCE was unchanged in April after having
v
e
D increased ½ percent in both February and March, and based on incoming data for retail
n
o sales and light motor vehicles, we project a gain of ¼ percent in May. We expect real
c
E
c PCE to rise at an annual rate of a little less than 3 percent this quarter following last
i
t
e s quarter’s 3½ percent rate of increase.
m
o
D
The incoming information on various determinants of spending has been mixed.
Disposable income has strengthened noticeably so far this year aided by the recovering
labor market, and there have been indications that credit conditions have become
somewhat less restrictive in recent months. However, the stock market has been falling,
and consumer sentiment, though edging higher, still remains at relatively low levels.
Home sales in recent months surged in advance of the expiration of the scheduled
homebuyer tax credit. However, sales by large homebuilders fell back sharply in May,
and the underlying pace of housing demand does not appear to have firmed much since
mid-2009. 5 And as for construction activity, single-family starts trended up through
April but fell off considerably in May; permit issuance was low in May as well. On
balance, we still expect real residential investment to show a bounce in the current
quarter, but we have scaled back our near-term assumptions for both starts and sales
reflecting our view that the recent data have indicated a stronger pull-forward from the
tax credit than we had anticipated.
Business Investment
Real investment in equipment and software (E&S) has continued to rise briskly.
We expect real E&S spending to increase at an annual rate of 20 percent this quarter, a
little faster than the average pace seen over the previous two quarters. Shipments of
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose at an average monthly rate of about
1½ percent over the three months ending in April, with those increases broad based.
Moreover, orders have outpaced shipments recently, suggesting that shipments will
continue to move up in coming months. In particular, outlays for purchases of high-tech
equipment appear to be rising rapidly this quarter. Finally, surveys of business
5 In order to qualify for the homebuyer tax credit, purchasers must have signed a sales agreement by
the end of April and must close by the end of June.

o
D
indicators such as the diffusion index for architectural billings—which tends to lead
spending growth by roughly two quarters—have improved to levels consistent with much
smaller declines in spending than has occurred in recent quarters. In all, our projection
now calls for only a small decline in building construction this quarter. At the same time,
energy prices remain high enough to sustain solid gains in real spending on drilling and
mining, and data through early June show that drilling activity has continued to climb, on
balance, in recent weeks.6
Incoming data indicate that firms have begun to restock their inventories. Real
nonfarm inventory investment turned positive in the first quarter, and data for April point
to continued modest accumulations in the current quarter. None of this accumulation is
expected to occur in the motor vehicles sector, however, where producers appear to be
holding production steady despite actual and expected increases in sales. Excluding
motor vehicles, we project that inventories will increase at an annual rate of $28 billion in
the second quarter, a bit more than as in the first quarter. Consistent with a return to
stockbuilding, both the Census book-value data and the staff’s flow-of-goods system
indicate that inventory-sales ratios for most industries appear to have moved into a
comfortable range.
Government
In the government sector, we expect total real federal purchases to rise at an
annual rate of 7 percent in the second quarter after remaining about flat in the previous
two quarters. Information from releases of the Monthly Treasury Statement through May
suggests that defense spending is rebounding toward a level more consistent with
appropriations; in addition, we estimate that nondefense spending is being boosted by
6 Offshore exploration represented only a small proportion (3 percent) of total drilling rigs in operation
prior to the moratorium on new deepwater energy exploration. Thus, we expect the moratorium to have
only a modest negative effect on drilling activity over the next six months—a reduction that is partially
recovered over the remainder of the projection period after the moratorium expires.

Foreign Trade
After subtracting almost 1 percentage point from real GDP growth in the first
quarter, real net exports are expected to take ¼ percentage point off GDP growth in the
second quarter. We expect some moderation in the cyclical rebound of import and export
growth this quarter, with imports expanding at about the same pace as exports but from a
larger base. We estimate that real exports rose at an annual rate of 8¼ percent in the
second quarter, driven by continued robust GDP growth in foreign economies and the
lagged effects of the dollar depreciation in 2009; this projection is a little lower than in
our April forecast, mainly reflecting weaker-than-expected April trade data. We estimate
that real imports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter, an upward
revision from the April forecast. Given the downward revision to export growth and the
upward revision to import growth, the projected contribution of net exports to GDP
growth in the second quarter is ¼ percentage point lower than in our previous forecast.
Prices and Wages
Inflation has remained subdued. Core PCE prices rose at an annual rate of about
½ percent in the first quarter, and while we think that figure reflects a bit of transitory
softness, our projection for the second quarter, at a little less than 1 percent, remains quite
low. Indeed, core PCE prices posted another small increase of 0.1 percent in April, in
line with our expectations in the April projection. Core goods prices have been declining
so far this year, with particularly large declines in prices of apparel and of durable goods
other than motor vehicles. Core services prices were also exceptionally soft in the first
quarter, held down by declines in prices for housing services and by very low price
increases for other market-based services around the turn of the year; in both cases, the
data for April were a bit firmer.
Headline PCE prices were unchanged in April as energy prices moved lower.
Consumer energy prices are projected to fall further in May and June in response to the

drop in crude oil prices since late April. As a result, on a quarterly average basis, total u t

The incoming data on labor compensation continue to be quite weak. Reflecting n

new estimates of wage and salary payments from unemployment insurance tax records, E

the Productivity and Costs measure of compensation per hour now shows a decline of t

e
m
roughly 2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in
o
D
compensation per hour in the first quarter has also been revised down since the April
projection, and this measure now appears to be increasing at only a 1 percent pace in the
first half of this year. By contrast, the ECI measure of hourly compensation costs rose at
an annual rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter, a bit more than we were expecting,
reflecting outsized increases in health insurance costs and in employer contributions to
retirement and savings plans. We do not expect that jump in benefits costs to be repeated
this quarter and thus expect the change in the ECI to step down to about 1¾ percent.
THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
Our forecast has the economy continuing to expand at a moderate pace, with real
GDP growth projected to be 3 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year and
3¾ percent in 2011. This rate of growth is noticeably slower than we projected in April,
reflecting the lower level of equity prices and the stronger exchange value of the dollar.
These forces are only partially offset by the lower oil prices and the lower path of
Treasury yields and mortgage interest rates. Despite these downward revisions to real
GDP growth, the basic story of our projection remains similar to that in previous
forecasts. The accommodative stance of monetary policy, an attenuation of financial
stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving
household and business confidence, all lead to a moderate recovery in economic activity
over the projection period.
The swing from sharp inventory drawdowns in mid-2009 to modest stockbuilding
in the first half of this year has contributed importantly to the upturn in real GDP thus far
in the recovery. And in the period ahead, we expect some further modest impetus to
production from a rising pace of inventory investment, as businesses attempt to keep
stocks in line with the expansion of business sales. But we expect the contribution to
GDP growth from inventories to be considerably smaller going forward than it has been

e
v
e The financial repair process remains an important driver of the anticipated firming
D

o
c
E availability of credit and helps set the stage for further improvements in household and
c
i
t business sentiment and spending. Over the past year, a marked improvement in broad
s
e
m
financial conditions is evident in higher equity prices and lower interest rate spreads for
o
D
corporate bonds and consumer loans. Nonetheless, some sectors of the economy remain
noticeably hampered by tight credit conditions. This circumstance has been especially
evident for bank-dependent borrowers such as small businesses, and in the construction
sector, where lending for development of nonresidential buildings and multifamily
housing has been very tight; many builders of single-family homes have also reportedly
faced difficulty in obtaining loans for land acquisition, development, and construction.
The spillover of recent events in Europe to U.S. financial markets has presented a setback
to the improvement in financial conditions that we had anticipated, providing one reason
why the rate of increase in real GDP in this projection, while still faster than the rise in
potential, is relatively tepid for an economic recovery.
The housing sector also helps to explain the relatively modest pace of overall
economic recovery in our projection. Limited credit availability to both homebuyers and
builders, as discussed above, is part of the reason for our expectation that the housing
sector will improve only slowly from the recent low levels of activity. The substantial
overhang of existing homes on the market, associated with the high level of foreclosure
activity, provides another reason for the slow pace of improvement, as this overhang
lessens the need for construction of new homes. Nevertheless, we look for housing
demand to continue to firm gradually in response to favorable affordability, further
confirmation that house prices are no longer declining appreciably, and the ongoing
improvement in job prospects. And, because the level of new home inventories is
exceptionally low, and given the imperfect substitutability between new and existing
homes stemming in part from location differences, stronger housing demand is likely to
show through to new single-family construction to some extent. In all, our forecast calls
for single-family starts to step up from their recent pace of about 500,000 units at an
annual rate to a pace of a little less than 900,000 units by the end of next year—a level of
construction that is still very modest by historical standards.

u t Although the downward revisions to wealth and income in this projection are
O
expected to restrain the growth of consumer spending noticeably relative to the April
&
e l forecast, we continue to expect that improving labor markets, increasing confidence in
v
e
D the durability of the recovery, greater access to credit, and a fading drag from earlier
n
o declines in household wealth will support the growth of consumer outlays over the
c
E
forecast period. Real PCE is projected to rise at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the
c
i
t
s second half of this year and to rise 3 percent in 2011. Given the downward revisions to
e
m
o wealth, the personal saving rate in this projection is almost ½ percentage point higher
D
than we projected in April. (The box on the saving rate provides more detail about the
rationale for our projection.)
The outlook for business investment is also revised down in this projection, as the
weaker pace of activity implies a reduced demand for new capital. Still, the overall
outlook for business purchases of equipment and software remains favorable, supported
by the replacement of aging capital, the resumption of investment projects deferred
during the financial crisis, and some expansion of capacity along with rising sales. The
same cannot be said for investment in structures, which, although expected to cease its
sharp rate of decline, is projected to do no better than level off through next year. The
recovery of nonresidential construction following a downturn tends to lag the recoveries
in other areas, likely because businesses require a greater degree of confidence in the
durability of recovery to commit to the purchase of such large-scale, long-lived assets.
Given the current weakness in demand fundamentals and tight credit conditions for this
sector, we do not expect a meaningful recovery for some time.
The change in our assumptions for federal grants to state and local governments is
small enough that it has only a slight effect on our projection for state and local spending.
We now project these expenditures to edge up ½ percent in 2011 after declining 1 percent
this year. Meanwhile, the rise in real federal expenditures is expected to slow from
3½ percent this year to 1½ percent in 2011, with a leveling off of defense purchases fully
accounting for the slowdown.
On average, net exports are expected to subtract ¼ percentage point from real
GDP growth in the second half of 2010 and in 2011, as imports increase at a slightly
slower pace than exports but from a larger base. The growth rates of both imports and
exports are projected to moderate from their robust recent pace as the cyclical
bounceback in trade continues to fade. Relative to the previous forecast, exports have

foreign growth, whereas imports are little revised, as the influence of the stronger dollar

and weaker U.S. activity are about offsetting. Thus, our projected contribution of net e l

Potential GDP and the NAIRU
We have made no material change to our estimates of potential GDP in this
projection. We assume that potential GDP will increase 2¼ percent this year and
2½ percent in 2011, smaller than the 2¾ percent gain in 2009. Last year, actual labor
productivity rose 5½ percent, and we interpret some of that impressive increase as
reflecting one-time efficiency gains that firms were able to achieve in a very difficult
business environment. We see such gains as persistent—and so have built them into the
level of structural multifactor productivity—but we do not believe them likely to be
repeated going forward. Partially offsetting the projected slowdown in structural
multifactor productivity growth is our anticipation of a larger contribution from capital
deepening: We estimate that capital deepening contributed little to structural productivity
growth in 2009, reflecting the lagged effect of the contraction in business investment
since late 2007, but we expect the contribution from capital deepening to start to pick up
this year and next as the projected recovery in business investment strengthens.
Also partially offsetting the projected slower pace of structural multifactor
productivity growth is our assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 5¼ percent through
2011, rather than rising as we believe occurred during 2009.7 This assumption, in
conjunction with anticipated population growth and a small downward trend in labor
force participation associated with the aging of the workforce, leads us to project
7 The 5¼ percent figure for the NAIRU does not include the effects of extended and emergency
unemployment benefits (EEB). EEB programs add to the unemployment rate by inducing individuals who
would otherwise have dropped out of the labor force to report themselves as unemployed in order to receive
these benefits, and by enabling jobseekers to be more deliberate in their search. We estimate that these
programs are currently boosting the unemployment rate by close to 1 percentage point, and we anticipate
that this effect will only diminish a bit through next year. As a result, the amount of unemployment not
representative of slack in resource utilization—which could be thought of as an “effective” NAIRU—is
currently around 6¼ percent and will edge down to about 5¾ percent by the end of next year.

Productivity and the Labor Market e
D
n
As just noted, we interpret some of last year’s outsized rise in labor productivity o
c
as reflecting efficiency gains that will be persistent even if not repeated. But we also E
c
i
judge that firms have placed strains on workers that will not prove sustainable. Firms s t
e
m
aggressively cut their staffing during the first half of last year and continued to reduce
o
D
payrolls in the second half despite a rise in real GDP of nearly 4 percent at an annual rate.
As a result, we judge the level of productivity to have moved well above its structural
level by the end of last year.
As firms continue to become more confident about the durability of the recovery,
we anticipate that they will further expand hiring to ease the strains on their existing
workforces, holding productivity growth below its structural rate. Indeed, we estimate
that labor productivity rose at an annual rate of about 1½ percent over the first half of this
year—a little less than its structural rate—and we project productivity growth to slow to
an average annual pace of less than 1 percent over the second half of this year and in
2011. Accordingly, we expect the pace of hours growth—and employment gains—to
pick up in coming quarters. However, given the weaker GDP path in this forecast, we
now expect the pickup in job growth to come more slowly than in our April projection,
with increases in private payroll employment projected to average about 200,000 per
month over the remainder of this year and 275,000 per month in 2011. This pace of job
gains results in a gradual reduction in the unemployment rate from 9¾ percent in the
second quarter to about 8½ percent by the end of next year; that end point is almost
½ percentage point higher than in the April projection.
Resource Utilization
The unemployment rate that we project for the end of 2011 remains some
2¾ percentage points above the level consistent with the NAIRU adjusted for our
estimate of the influence of extended and emergency unemployment benefits (EEB) on
structural unemployment. This considerable degree of slack is expected to be
accompanied by a number of other conditions consistent with a still-weak labor market,
including a below-trend level of labor force participation and, in all likelihood, an
unusually large concentration of workers experiencing unemployment spells of long
duration.

Our projection for the GDP gap also indicates that the amount of slack in the u t
O
economy is expected to diminish but remain substantial through 2011. Given our
&
downward revision for real GDP growth, we project the GDP gap to shrink from e l
v
e
7¼ percent at the end of 2009 to 5½ percent at the end of 2011; the gap at the end of next D
n
year is about 1 percentage point wider than in the April projection. We expect slack in o
c
E
the industrial sector to be taken up more quickly than in the economy as a whole, in part
c
i
t
because manufacturing capacity is estimated to have declined in 2009 and to fall further s
e
m
in 2010. Even so, the factory operating rate at the end of the projection period is about o
D
1¼ percentage points below its recent peak in the third quarter of 2007.
Compensation and Prices
We continue to project that the wide margin of unused resources, along with the
deceleration in price inflation, will restrain labor costs over the medium term. The
Productivity and Cost measure of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector
is projected to rise 1¾ percent this year and 2¼ percent next year; both figures are a little
lower than in the April projection. Similarly, we expect the employment cost index to
rise at an annual rate of about 2 percent over the forecast period. These modest increases
in hourly compensation, in conjunction with the moderate projected increase in labor
productivity, imply increases in unit labor costs of only about 1 percent, on average, this
year and next.
The higher path of the dollar in this projection, together with the downward
revision to the path for non-oil commodity prices, has led us to reduce our projection for
core goods import prices (that is, goods excluding fuels, computers, and semiconductors).
We now expect core import prices to edge lower over the second half of this year, down
from a 2 percent projected rate of increase in the April forecast. We project that core
import prices will increase a modest 1½ percent in 2011, as the dollar begins to
depreciate and commodity prices remain flat. In all, we now anticipate that import prices
will be about a neutral influence on core PCE prices over the projection period, rather
than a small positive influence as was the case in April.
As noted earlier, the weaker paths of core import prices and oil prices, and the
increase in resource slack, all augment the downward pressures on inflation in this
forecast relative to those in the April projection; however, with inflation expectations
anticipated to remain stable, we have made only a small downward revision to our core
inflation projection. In particular, we project that core PCE prices will rise ¾ percent in

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
s
t
e
m
o
We have extended the staff forecast to 2014 using the FRB/US model and staff D
assessments of long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.
The contour of the long-run outlook depends on the following key assumptions:
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run,
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by
FOMC participants at the April meeting.
 Redemptions, prepayments, and sales of agency debt and MBS are assumed to
significantly reduce holdings of longer-term securities in the Federal
Reserve’s portfolio by the end of 2014. This decrease in the Fed's holdings is
assumed to contribute about 25 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury
yield from 2012 through 2014.
 Risk premiums on corporate bonds and equity, which have widened in this
projection, decline gradually. This assumption is consistent with the view that
the threat of systemic disruptions to global financial markets gradually abates.
Banks ease their lending standards somewhat further beyond 2011.
 Fiscal stimulus policies continue to boost the level of government spending
through 2012. The federal government budget deficit narrows to about
5 percent of GDP by the end of 2014. This improvement reflects the effects
of the economic recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments, as well as
further policy actions after 2011 aimed at reducing the deficit.
 From 2012 to 2014, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to
depreciate 1¼ percent per year in real terms. The price of WTI crude oil rises
gradually to nearly $90 per barrel by the end of 2014, consistent with futures
prices. Under these assumptions, movements in the prices of energy and
imports have only minor implications for domestic inflation in the extension.

u t Foreign real GDP expands, on average, about 3½ percent per year from 2012

&

v
e  With emergency and extended unemployment benefit programs assumed to
D
n continue winding down over 2012, the “effective” NAIRU falls from
o
c
E 5¾ percent at the end of 2011 to 5¼ percent by the end of 2012 and then
c
t i remains at that level through 2014. Potential GDP is assumed to expand just
s
e
m above 2½ percent per year, on average, from 2012 to 2014.
o
D
The unemployment rate enters 2012 at a very high level, and inflation is well
below the assumed long-run target. Under the assumptions used to construct the
extension, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound through the middle
of 2012. From that point on, the federal funds rate climbs steadily, reaching 2½ percent
by the end of 2013 and 3½ percent in 2014.8 Real GDP continues to increase faster than
potential, decelerating gradually after 2012 as pent-up demand is satisfied and interest
rates rise. The unemployment rate falls to the NAIRU by late 2014. Core PCE inflation
moves up modestly after 2011 as economic activity recovers and long-run inflation
expectations are assumed to remain well anchored.
8 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate (R) follows the prescriptions of a Taylor-type rule of
the form R = 2.5 + π - 1.1(u-u*) + 0.5(π – 2), subject to the zero lower bound constraint. In this
expression, π denotes the four-quarter rate of core PCE inflation, u is the civilian unemployment rate, and
u* is the staff estimate of the NAIRU (with an adjustment for the temporary effects on unemployment of
the extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs). In essence, this is just the traditional
Taylor rule, rewritten in terms of the unemployment gap, with the coefficient on resource utilization
appropriately rescaled.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Although incoming data on economic activity abroad have generally surprised on
the upside, we expect the recent deepening of global financial stresses associated with the
debt crisis in Europe to hold down activity in Europe and in much of the rest of the world
as well. Accordingly, we have marked down our forecast for growth abroad starting in
the second half of this year.
Growth in the first quarter turned out to be significantly higher than we were
k
o
anticipating at the time of the April forecast in Canada, Japan, Brazil, and a number of
o
l
t
emerging Asian economies. Although Mexican GDP reportedly contracted, we are u
O
inclined to discount that outcome as other Mexican data were more upbeat. Foreign &
l
indicators for the second quarter—such as industrial production, retail sales, and e
v
e
exports—point to continued momentum for the global economy. All told, we have D
n
marked up our estimate for aggregate foreign growth by ½ percentage point for the first o
c
E
half of this year, to 4½ percent. l

Going forward, our outlook for activity abroad is shaped by our sense of how the
sovereign debt crisis in Europe is likely to evolve. Obviously, the future trajectory of this
crisis is clouded by considerable uncertainty, but we believe the following working
assumptions are plausible. First, official support should prove sufficient for Greece to
avoid restructuring of its sovereign debt through 2011, although fiscal sustainability
concerns will remain. Second, some progress toward fiscal consolidation will be made in
Greece and other vulnerable European economies, although this progress may well fall
short of announced plans. Third, markets should increasingly differentiate countries

such as Spain from Greece, thereby reducing the likelihood that heightened concerns
about Greece will spill over onto its neighbors. In addition, meaningful action taken to
enhance confidence in European banks should allow markets, over time, to differentiate
between stronger and weaker institutions, which should increase the resiliency of the
financial system. Finally, we assume that the European Central Bank (ECB) will
maintain its stimulative stance.
Given these assumptions, we expect that financial markets will remain agitated
into the early part of next year, but tensions in these markets should then begin to recede
as European countries make progress toward fiscal consolidation and strengthening their
k
o financial systems. Even so, the extended period of financial strain is likely to lead to
o
l
t
u adverse effects on consumer and business confidence and to tighter credit conditions, and
O
& these factors will weigh on foreign activity, both within and outside of Europe.
l
e Accordingly, we expect that growth abroad will move down to about 3¼ percent in the
v
e
D second half of this year and stay at around that rate in 2011.
n
o
c
E This projection for global growth is ½ percentage point weaker over the forecast

t
n period than we anticipated in April. We would have cut our foreign growth forecast
I
further, were it not for the fact that the substantial markdown to final domestic demand in
the euro area is partly offset by a boost to net exports resulting from the much weaker
euro. By the same token, although many U.S. trading partners will be adversely affected
by the markdown in U.S. activity, this is partially offset by the decline in their currencies
against the dollar. Finally, we continue to see robust growth in the emerging market
economies, which have the space for further monetary and fiscal stimulus, if necessary.
Although in our outlook, Europe’s sovereign debt problems lead to a material
slowing of the global economic recovery, we underscore that this baseline forecast
assumes an eventual easing of financial stresses. Much worse outcomes are possible, as
illustrated in the box in the Risks and Uncertainty section titled “Consequences of a
Severe European Sovereign Debt Crisis.”
Consumer price inflation in the foreign economies appears to have moderated to a
greater extent in the second quarter than we were anticipating at the time of the April
forecast, partly reflecting the fall in oil and commodity prices. Inflation abroad should
remain subdued at about 2 percent over the forecast period, given the presence of
significant resource slack in a number of foreign economies.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
We now estimate that real GDP in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) grew
3½ percent in the first quarter, 1 percentage point higher than estimated in the last
forecast, largely driven by upward surprises in Canadian private demand and Japanese
exports. Monthly indicators point to still solid growth of over 3 percent in the second
quarter. However, we project that growth will move down to 2¼ percent in the second
half of this year and remain at that pace in 2011, as the fiscal crisis in Europe and
attendant global financial spillovers weigh on these economies. Core inflation rates in
the AFEs are projected to remain subdued, as substantial economic slack persists over the
k
forecast period. o

Euro Area
In spite of the ongoing stresses related to Greece, indicators of euro-area
economic activity have come in fairly strong in recent months, and we estimate that real
GDP growth in the second quarter picked up to nearly 2 percent. In April, industrial
production expanded 0.8 percent, and German manufacturing orders rose almost
3 percent from the previous month. After reaching its highest level since August 2007,
the composite PMI edged down in May but remained solidly in the range indicating
expansion. Going forward, however, we expect that the financial stresses in Europe will
finally show through to economic activity as consumer and business confidence decline,
equity prices remain depressed, bank lending conditions tighten, and governments
implement their fiscal consolidation plans. (We expect fiscal policy to subtract about
¼ percentage point from euro-area GDP growth in 2010 and a more substantial
1¼ percentage points in 2011.) In consequence, real GDP growth is projected to slow to
Page 37 of 96

--- Page 41 ---

C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 16, 2010
only 1 percent in the second half of this year before edging up to 1¼ percent next year, as
financial conditions begin to normalize and business and consumer sentiment improves.
All told, our projection for euro-area growth over the next six quarters has been
revised down ¾ percentage point since the April forecast. The intensification of financial
stresses since the April forecast led us to revise down our forecast for the growth of final
domestic demand 1 percentage point. However, because we are also penciling in higher
net exports resulting from the recent depreciation of the euro, our forecast for total GDP
growth is revised down less.
k
o We see the fiscal crisis as affecting different economies in the euro area to
o
l
t different degrees. Our forecast for growth in Germany is down only ½ percentage point,
u
O
as it greatly benefits from the weaker euro, but the peripheral countries will be hit hard as
&
e l they attempt to slash their fiscal deficits in a fragile environment. We do not anticipate a
v
e
D debt restructuring or other severely adverse financial event in any peripheral euro-area
n
economy during the forecast period, given the significant official support measures
o
c
E announced since the April forecast. (See the box on “Recent Policy Announcements by
l
’
t
n European Authorities.”)
I
Persistent resource slack in the euro area should continue to restrain inflation, and
we project headline consumer price inflation to come in at 1 percent this year and 1½
percent next year. Core inflation is expected to hold steady at rates below 1 percent until
the end of 2011. Amid weaker output growth and subdued inflationary pressures, we
expect the ECB to maintain easy monetary and liquidity conditions and keep its
benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent through the end of the forecast period.
United Kingdom
After being held back in the first quarter by the January value-added tax hike, real
GDP is set to expand 2 percent in the current quarter. Although PMIs, business
confidence, and manufacturing orders are consistent with more robust growth, measures
of real spending and production have yet to confirm that the recovery has gained a solid
footing. Going forward, GDP growth should drift up, reaching 2½ percent by the end of
the forecast period. We project that final domestic demand will strengthen, as
households repair their balance sheets and financial stresses ease. Diminishing support
from inventories and increasing drag from fiscal retrenchment will exert only a partial
offset.

Relative to the April projection, our growth forecast is down ½ percentage point
over the forecast period. This revision reflects not only the lower confidence and tighter
financial conditions spilling over from the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, but also
faster fiscal consolidation than we assumed in the April forecast. The coalition of
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, which recently gained control of the U.K.
government, is moving quickly to adopt ambitious fiscal targets.
Headline 12-month inflation, at 3.4 percent in May, is expected to remain
elevated this year, boosted by the hike in the value-added tax and the depreciation of the
pound, before retreating rapidly to below the 2-percent target in early 2011, as substantial
k
o slack in the economy becomes the predominant force on prices. We have pushed back

growth through May and ongoing expansion of real trade. Beginning in the third quarter,
we expect the financial stresses spilling over from Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and the
associated substantial projected slowdown in U.S. GDP growth to weigh on the Canadian
outlook, leading growth to decline further to 3¼ percent during the forecast period.
Compared with our April forecast, this forecast is down slightly in the second half of this
year and more substantially in 2011.
In response to a closing output gap and with inflation squarely within its target
band of 1 to 3 percent, the Bank of Canada (BOC) raised its target for the overnight rate
to 50 basis points at its June meeting, a slightly earlier start to policy tightening than we
had anticipated. We assume that the BOC will continue to raise rates 25 basis points per
quarter over the forecast period.
Japan
Japanese real GDP continued to recover in the first quarter, rising at a robust
5 percent pace, led by an ongoing surge in exports. Export growth picked up further in
April, and other indicators—including industrial production, machinery orders, and
consumer confidence—have continued to gradually improve. As such, we project that
Page 40 of 96

--- Page 44 ---

C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 16, 2010
real GDP will rise 3¾ percent in the second quarter, 2 percentage points faster than in the
last forecast. Going forward, we anticipate that growth will decline to 1¾ percent for the
remainder of the forecast period, as the fiscal impetus and the rebound in external
demand begin to taper off, and as private domestic spending picks up only slowly. This
projection is only a bit slower than in the April forecast, as demand from emerging Asia
continues to support exports.
Notwithstanding the faster-than-expected recovery, considerable resource slack
remains, and core prices (excluding food and energy) declined a record 1.7 percent in
April from their year-earlier level, although part of the downtick reflected a one-off cut in
k
public school fees. With the output gap continuing to narrow going forward, we project o

headline deflation to moderate to 1 percent in the second half of 2010 and to ¾ percent in u

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
I
n
First-quarter GDP data for many emerging market economies (EMEs) surprised
on the upside. However, real GDP contracted in Mexico and, given its high weight, led
to a markdown in aggregate growth in the EMEs, albeit to a still-solid 6½ percent.
Incoming data point to only a small moderation of growth in the second quarter. We
expect EME growth to fall to 4½ percent in the second half of this year and stay at that
pace next year, as the double-digit rates recorded in several economies step down to
more-sustainable rates. This projection is about ½ percentage point lower than in the
April forecast, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions and the markdown
in U.S. and European growth.
After climbing to 4½ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, consumer price
inflation in the EMEs is estimated to have declined to 3 percent in the current quarter, in
large part because of an unwinding of the effects of increases in food prices, administered
prices, and taxes. Consumer prices so far in the second quarter have generally surprised
on the downside, and, going forward, our projection for EME inflation at 3 percent is
slightly lower compared with the April forecast.

I
We expect Chinese real GDP growth to average around 9 percent through the
remainder of the forecast period, down from the double-digit pace of the past four
quarters, as fiscal stimulus wanes and monetary tightening continues, in part to address
rising property prices. We have marked down Chinese growth only a touch, as Chinese
authorities have the scope to reintroduce stimulus measures should activity slow more
than is consistent with their objectives.
Chinese authorities raised banks’ reserve requirement 50 basis points in May,
bringing the cumulative increase for the year to 150 basis points. Concerns about global
growth stemming from the European fiscal crisis may restrain the extent of policy
tightening going forward. We continue to assume that the Chinese authorities will allow
the renminbi to start appreciating against the U.S. dollar later this year. However, the
unsettled global outlook, along with the recent appreciation of the renminbi on a trade-
weighted basis as it has followed the dollar upward, have led us to scale back the
projected pace of renminbi appreciation against the dollar this year.
Inflation pressures in China appear to be waning as food prices have retreated,
although there was an uptick in monthly inflation in May. Recent labor unrest at some

factories in China, including a strike at Honda Motor Company, has resulted in some
large wage increases, which poses a risk of more widespread increases and heightened
inflationary pressures.
Other Emerging Asia
Real GDP in the emerging Asia region outside of China has grown at a double-
digit rate on average over the past year on the back of Chinese growth, which has boosted
the region’s exports, and policy stimulus. This has pushed the level of GDP well above
its pre-crisis peak. Real GDP in emerging Asia excluding China rose more than
14 percent in the first quarter, in part reflecting a nearly 40 percent rise (annual rate) in
k
o
Singapore’s notoriously volatile output. A further hike in Singapore’s industrial o
l
t
u
production in April points to strong second-quarter GDP as well, but we project a big
O
payback in the third quarter. In South Korea, a reduced boost from government &
l
e
spending and inventories should push second-quarter growth down to a more sustainable v
e
D
4½ percent pace, from 8¾ percent in the first quarter, but consumer and business

confidence has remained firm in the face of heightened tensions with North Korea. c
E
Indian growth is also expected to taper off, to a still-robust 8 percent pace in the current l
’
t
n
quarter, while growth in the ASEAN-4 region should dip to about 3 percent, in part as the I
recent political turmoil in Thailand likely weighed on activity.
All told, smoothing through the third-quarter payback in Singapore, we project
growth in emerging Asia excluding China to settle to a more-sustainable pace of
4½ percent in the fourth quarter and through next year, as the crisis-related fiscal and
monetary stimulus measures are withdrawn. Nevertheless, the turmoil in Europe and
greater uncertainty about the pace of global recovery may prompt policymakers in the
region to delay their exits from stimulus.
Latin America
We project that real GDP in Latin America grew just ½ percent in the first quarter
but bounced back to 5 percent in the second quarter. The anemic growth in the first
quarter is driven largely by a reported 1½ percent contraction of real GDP in Mexico.
However, we put little stock in that decline, as it is inconsistent with monthly indicators:
The Mexican activity indicator (a monthly proxy for GDP) rose 2 percent in the first
quarter at an annual rate; and recently Mexican industrial production, exports, and retail
sales have all been showing strength. Brazilian GDP, which has a much lower weight in
Page 43 of 96

--- Page 47 ---

C lass II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 16, 2010
our aggregate for Latin America, soared 11½ percent in the first quarter, although waning
fiscal stimulus appears to be restraining growth there in the current quarter.
We expect that growth in Latin America will slow over the second half of this
year, largely reflecting a deceleration in activity in Mexico and Brazil, and come in at
about 3½ percent next year. Mexico’s step-down in growth is in line with the moderation
in the expansion of U.S. manufacturing output. A significant degree of resource slack in
Mexico is likely to be unwound only slowly, pushing inflation down to 3¾ percent by
2011, within the Bank of Mexico’s (BOM) 2 to 4 percent target range. Accordingly, we
do not expect the BOM to start raising its policy rate until next year. In Brazil, by
k
o contrast, the projected slowing of economic growth reflects the unwinding of fiscal
o
l
t
u stimulus measures and a cumulative rise in the policy rate since April of 150 basis points.
O
& The passing of some special factors boosting prices earlier this year is expected to allow
l
e Brazilian inflation to decline to 4¼ percent in 2011, but with the economy continuing to
v
e
D overheat, we expect further monetary tightening over the forecast period.

Financial Developments
Over the intermeeting period, investor demand for risky assets declined in response
to the evolving European fiscal crisis and concerns about the outlook for the global
recovery. In domestic markets, investors significantly tempered their expectations for
policy tightening, while broad equity price indexes fell about 6 percent, implied
volatilities spiked, and corporate bond spreads widened notably. The demand for safer
securities contributed to a fall in nominal Treasury yields of as much as 35 basis points
and a 2¾ percent increase in the broad trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the
dollar. Investors also priced in lower compensation for future inflation over the period.
In most advanced foreign economies, benchmark sovereign yields declined substantially,
and headline equity indexes dropped, with bank shares in the euro area losing almost 10
percent of their value. In response to the reemergence of strains in U.S. dollar funding
markets, the Federal Reserve and several foreign central banks reestablished dollar
liquidity swap arrangements in early May.
Overall borrowing by nonfinancial businesses was well maintained over the period,
despite a slowdown in speculative-grade bond issuance in May. Indicators of credit
quality in the business sector remained strong, and analysts’ revisions to corporate
earnings forecasts were positive this quarter. In contrast, conditions in the commercial s
t
n
real estate market stayed bleak. In the household sector, mortgage debt fell further in the e
m
p
first quarter, and measures of refinancing activity remained subdued despite historically o
l
e
low mortgage interest rates. Consumer credit was about unchanged in April, and v
e
D
measures of consumer delinquencies edged down further.
l
a
i
c
n
Bank credit continued to decline in April and May, although the contraction in C&I a
n
i
and residential real estate loans slowed somewhat. Bank profitability improved in the F
first quarter, boosted by higher net interest margins and a reduction in loan loss
provisions. M2 increased moderately, on balance, over April and May, as sizable net
declines in small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds were more than
offset by strong net gains in liquid deposits.
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS

the federal funds rate and the wording of the accompanying statement were largely in line
with expectations and garnered little market reaction. Upon the release of the minutes of
the meeting, investors reportedly took note that a majority of participants favored asset
sales at some point, although the release did not result in any notable change in market
interest rates. Economic data releases were mixed on balance over the intermeeting
period, but market participants were especially attentive to incoming information on the
labor market—most notably, the private payroll figures in the employment report for
May, which were considerably weaker than investors had expected. These data,
combined with heightened concerns about the global economic outlook stemming from
the European sovereign debt crisis, contributed to a downward revision in the expected
path of policy.
Indeed, combined with the staff’s usual assumption regarding term premiums,
futures quotes indicate that investors pushed back their expectation for the first increase
in the federal funds rate target to the first quarter of 2011 and scaled down the expected
subsequent pace of policy firming. Quotes on interest rate caps suggest that investors’
perceived modal path of the federal funds rate also moved lower over the intermeeting
period and that they now see late 2011 as the most likely time for the commencement of
tightening. Results from the June survey of primary dealers also suggest that market

ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Broad U.S. stock price indexes fell about 6 percent, on net, over the intermeeting
period, reflecting the deepening of concerns about the European fiscal crisis and the
potential for adverse spillovers to global economic growth. Option-implied volatility on
the S&P 500 index, as measured by the VIX, spiked in mid-May to more than double its
value at the time of the April FOMC meeting, reaching levels last recorded in early 2009;
implied stock market volatility fell back somewhat toward the end of the intermeeting
period. The spread between the staff’s estimate of the expected real return on equities
over the next 10 years and an estimate of the expected real return on a 10-year Treasury
note—a measure of the equity risk premium—jumped about 1½ percentage points from
its already elevated level. Equity mutual funds experienced sizable net outflows in May,
contributing to the first monthly net redemption of long-term mutual funds since March
2009.
Investors’ attitudes toward financial institutions deteriorated somewhat more than for
the broader market this intermeeting period, with bank equity indexes falling 10 percent
and bank CDS spreads widening a bit more than those on investment-grade nonfinancial
firms. Allegations of past malfeasance at some large former investment banks and the
s

F i Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds rose slightly over the intermeeting period, and

on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, spreads on both speculative-grade and
investment-grade corporate bonds widened significantly, although they remained within
the range prevailing since last summer. Secondary-market bid prices on syndicated
leveraged loans fell about 2 percentage points, while bid-asked spreads in that market
climbed.

Conditions in short-term funding markets deteriorated somewhat, particularly for
European borrowers. Spreads of term Libor over rates on overnight index swaps (OIS)
widened notably, with trading volumes in maturities longer than one week reportedly
quite thin. Market participants also reduced holdings of commercial paper sponsored by
entities thought to have exposures to peripheral European financial institutions and
governments. (See the box on U.S. dollar funding pressures.) Even so, spreads of high-
grade unsecured financial commercial paper to nonfinancial commercial paper widened
only about 5 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. Thus far, quarter-end
pressures in domestic bank funding markets appear to have been relatively muted.1
In secured funding markets, spreads on asset-backed commercial paper also widened
modestly, while rates on repurchase agreements (repos) involving Treasury and agency
collateral were little changed.2 In the inaugural Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey,
which was conducted by the Federal Reserve at the end of May, dealers generally
reported that the terms at which they provided credit remained tight relative to 2006,
although they noted some loosening of terms, on net, over the previous three months for
certain classes of clients—including hedge funds, institutional investors, and nonfinancial
corporations—and intensified pressures by those clients to negotiate more-favorable
terms. At the same time, they reported a pick-up in demand for financing across several

agency MBS widened somewhat relative to Treasury securities. Despite the low level of
mortgage rates, refinancing volume has been relatively light because many homeowners
refinanced when rates reached similar lows in 2009, while others may be unable to
refinance due to low credit scores or insufficient home equity. Home mortgage debt
declined at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the first quarter, as the volume of
originations is estimated to have remained low and as elevated charge-offs pushed down
existing loan balances; the available data point to some additional decline in the current
quarter. Delinquency rates for prime, subprime, and FHA-backed mortgages edged down
in March and April, although some of the decline likely reflected seasonal patterns.
House price indexes have changed little of late.
The contraction in consumer credit is estimated to have moderated in the first
quarter, as an upturn in non revolving credit offset much of the continued steep decline in
revolving credit. Issuance of consumer credit ABS increased in May—though the level
was still well below that observed before the onset of the financial crisis—and spreads
have ticked up in recent weeks. Credit card ABS issuance remains subdued, as
regulatory changes have made financing credit card receivables via securitization less
desirable. In primary markets, spreads of credit card interest rates over those on Treasury
securities remained extremely high in April, while interest-rate spreads on auto loans
s

F i Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations has continued to expand in

in the U.S. remained solid, on average, in April and May, and nonfinancial commercial
paper increased as well over the two months. High-yield corporate bond issuance in the
U.S. briefly paused in May amid the market’s pullback from risky assets, although
speculative-grade U.S. firms continued to sell bonds abroad and a few placed issues
domestically in the first half of June. Meanwhile, the contraction in C&I loans
outstanding slowed significantly in May from the pace registered over the past year and a
half, with some indications that loan originations have begun to pick up.

Gross equity issuance fell a bit, on net, in April and May, likely owing in part to
recent equity price declines and market volatility. Through the first quarter, equity
retirements due to cash-financed M&A deals and share repurchases remained strong,
leaving net equity issuance negative. Announcements of both repurchases and M&A
deals continued apace in April and May.
Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms have generally shown continued
improvement. Based on preliminary data, the ratio of aggregate liquid assets to total
assets for nonfinancial corporations remained in record-high territory in the first quarter,
and the aggregate debt-to-asset ratio declined a bit further. Although the expected default
rate for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV stayed at a somewhat elevated level, the
dollar value of Moody’s upgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds significantly outpaced
that of downgrades during April and May, and the six-month trailing default rate for
bonds issued by nonfinancial firms fell further in May to only a bit above zero. First-
quarter profits for firms in the S&P 500 appear to have jumped about 20 percent at a
quarterly rate. This fourth consecutive quarter of solid earnings gains primarily reflected
an upturn in financial sector profits from quite depressed levels. Revisions to year-ahead
expected earnings jumped in mid-May to a record-high reading for the 30-year history of
the series. However, analysts generally have yet to react to recent weeks’ developments,
s

F commercial mortgages continued to climb in May, and indexes of commercial mortgage
CDS prices declined, on net, over the intermeeting period. With charge-offs mounting
and new lending stalled, outstanding commercial mortgage debt decreased at an annual
rate of 4½ percent in the first quarter.
GOVERNMENT FINANCE
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned about $335 billion of
nominal coupon securities across the maturity spectrum. As it had previously announced,
the Treasury has reduced the sizes of its coupon auctions a bit in recent weeks, reflecting
Page 58 of 96

--- Page 62 ---

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 16, 2010
some easing of its borrowing needs. This period’s auctions were well received, with bid-
to-cover ratios generally above historical averages.
The municipal bond market also remained receptive to issuers over the intermeeting
period, despite continued concerns about the financial health of state and local
governments. In the first quarter, downgrades of municipal bonds outpaced upgrades, but
gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained solid in recent months, helped by
continued strength in issuance for capital projects under the Build America Bond
program. Yields on long-term municipal bonds fell less than those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities, leaving their yield ratios significantly higher over the
period. Although some of this increase reflects the effect of investors’ safe-haven
demand for Treasury securities, the ratio of municipal bond yields to yields on
comparable-maturity AAA-rated corporate bonds also moved noticeably higher.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
The threat to global growth and European financial stability posed by the fiscal crisis
in Greece and by the potential for similar troubles in some other European countries has
sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows. Concerns that Chinese policy tightening to
s
damp property speculation might derail China’s economic growth may also have n t
e
m
contributed to the retreat from risky assets. This retreat led to a broad appreciation of the
p
o
dollar and declines in both equities and yields on benchmark sovereign bonds. Investor l
e
v
sentiment has improved over the past week, leading to a partial reversal in these e
D
movements, despite Moody’s downgrade of Greece to junk status in mid-June. On net, a l

c
the dollar has appreciated more than 7 percent against the euro since April 27 and has n
a
n
risen 3 percent against sterling. Of note, the dollar has increased 1 percent or more F i
against the currencies of Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Malaysia even as the strong pace
of growth in these economies led their central banks to tighten monetary policy.
Headline equity indexes are down 4 to 12 percent in advanced foreign economies
over the period and are also lower in most emerging market economies. Consistent with
flight-to-quality flows, emerging market equity inflows turned negative over the period.
Bank shares in the euro area have been particularly hard hit by the ongoing fiscal crisis
and the reemergence of pressures on bank funding. The strains in euro money markets
led the ECB to reinstitute a six-month lending operation and switch its three-month

lending operations from a fixed-quantity auction to a full-allotment offering at a fixed
rate of 1 percent. Strains also appeared in corporate debt markets as both nonfinancial
and financial corporate debt issuance dropped substantially in the second quarter. In
addition, pressures in dollar funding markets reappeared for foreign financial institutions,
especially those thought to have significant exposure to Greece and other peripheral euro-
area countries. To help contain these pressures and to prevent their spread to other
institutions and regions, the Federal Reserve reestablished dollar liquidity swap
arrangements with the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
Canada, and the Swiss National Bank.
Benchmark sovereign yields in the major advanced foreign economies, with the
exception of Japan, have declined 20 to 45 basis points on net. The decreases were due
in part to investors shifting out of risky assets and into the safety of sovereign securities
in the major economies. In addition, concerns that Europe’s fiscal problems were
clouding the outlook for global growth may have prompted sovereign yields to move
lower. Consistent with a flight into safe assets, foreign private net purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities remained elevated in April, the latest month for which data are
available, after increasing substantially in the first quarter of this year relative to the
average rate recorded in 2009.

Some signs of strain have also been evident in emerging Europe. Hungarian

the country’s fiscal problems prompted a sharp selloff of the forint. Market participants
have come to believe that those comments exaggerated the difficulties for domestic
political purposes, but substantial uncertainty remains. Amid a weakening outlook for

growth in the region, central banks in several emerging European economies—Russia,
the Czech Republic, Romania, and Hungary—have begun to decrease policy rates.
Foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities remained strong through April.
More-timely data on custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show a
decline in foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities in May, only partly offset
by higher holdings of agency securities. Official inflows from emerging market countries
likely slowed, as emerging markets have had to purchase fewer dollars to resist their
currencies’ appreciation now that the dollar has been strengthening.
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY
Bank credit fell in April and May at about the same pace as in the first quarter on
average, and it has now declined for 15 consecutive months. The contraction in core
loans (C&I, real estate, and consumer loans) continued to be the primary cause of the
decline, on balance, but the runoff of core loans slowed somewhat relative to the past
several quarters. C&I loans, after falling at a 17 percent annual rate in April, decreased at
only an 8 percent pace in May, the smallest drop in 18 months. While commercial real
estate and home equity loans fell at a slightly faster rate than in recent quarters, the
s
t
n contraction in closed-end residential loans abated, partly because of a reduced pace of

adjusting for the effects of the accounting rule changes, outstanding loan balances fell
further in the first quarter at both weak banks—those with CAMELS ratings of 3, 4, or
5—and strong banks—those with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2. In addition, unused
commitments to fund loans declined again in the first quarter. Meanwhile, a reduction in
risk-weighted assets and capital infusions from parent holding companies further boosted
risk-based capital ratios from already high levels.
The Survey of Terms of Business Lending showed that the weighted-average interest
rate spread on C&I loans of less than $25 million was about unchanged in May, after
adjusting for non-price loan characteristics. The share of originations by branches and
agencies of foreign banks declined compared with that from three months ago, while the
share of loans in riskier loan categories rose slightly. The weighted-average adjusted
spread on loans made under commitment with a credit line of less than $1 million—a
proxy for lending to smaller firms—ticked down slightly but remained very elevated.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, M2 contracted in April but surged in May. A
significant portion of this swing was likely attributable to tax payments by households
that were unusually low this year. The lower payments likely tempered both the usual
buildup in liquid deposits in April in advance of the tax date and the runoff of those

weighted assets in advance of the implementation of FAS 166/167 because they had provided material
support to the securitization structures. Banks were not allowed to phase in the effects of FAS 166/167 on

Over April and May, the monetary base contracted at an average annual rate of 20
percent, driven by a decline in reserve balances that primarily resulted from a drop in
usage of the Federal Reserve’s credit and lending facilities and an increase in the
Treasury’s accounts with the Federal Reserve. Over the intermeeting period, primary
credit outstanding declined about $6 billion, but total reserves increased $45 billion,
owing to the settlement of previously purchased MBS and a reduction in the Treasury’s
general account (see the box on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet). In preparation for
possible future reserve draining operations, the Federal Reserve conducted its first small-
scale auction to test the Term Deposit Facility in June (see the box on the Term Deposit
Facility).

Risks and Uncertainty
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic activity as
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by
the Committee). On the domestic front, the depth and length of the recession have been
unmatched in recent history, and the fact that the downturn originated in a severe
financial crisis makes it qualitatively different from other postwar contractions. Because
of these differences, gauging the likely strength of recovery is particularly difficult, and
we see sizable risks on both sides of our projection. In addition to these domestic risks,
several European countries face considerable fiscal and financial stress, leading to
substantial uncertainties about the effects of these strains on European economic activity,
world financial markets, and real activity in the United States. While outcomes in Europe
could be more or less favorable than we have assumed in the baseline, we place non-
negligible odds on an adverse tail event in which developments in Europe trigger a
systemic financial and economic crisis that spills over to the United States; one possible
scenario along these lines is described in the box titled “Consequences of a Severe
European Sovereign Debt Crisis.” Taking account of this possibility and other factors,
we judge the risks to our projection of real activity as skewed to the downside.
We also see the risks around our inflation projection as elevated relative to the
experience of the past 20 years. In many dimensions relevant for the inflation outlook,
we are in uncharted territory. Recent readings on actual inflation have been exceptionally
low. The size and nature of the adverse shocks to activity were extraordinary, and
identifying the supply and demand components of these shocks is particularly difficult,
making estimation of the output gap especially difficult. Moreover, a number of other
factors are outside the range of historical experience. The federal funds rate is effectively
at the zero lower bound, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded dramatically,
and fiscal policy is deemed by many to be on an unsustainable path. Weighing these
y
risks to both the upside and downside, we continue to see the risks around our inflation n t

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of these risks, we consider a number of alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In these scenarios, the federal
funds rate is assumed to respond to movements in real activity and inflation as prescribed
by a simple policy rule. We generate most of the scenarios using the FRB/US model and
the same policy rule for the federal funds rate as that detailed in the long-run outlook
section of the domestic outlook discussion, with nontraditional policy assumed to follow
the baseline path. The first scenario, however, is generated using the multicountry
SIGMA model, which uses a somewhat different policy rule that employs an alternative
concept of resource utilization.1
Normalization in Europe
In our baseline forecast, Europe’s unsettled financial conditions will persist
through the remainder of this year before gradually improving. In this scenario, we
instead assume a more rapid normalization of European financial conditions that restores
confidence in global economic prospects and triggers a decline of the dollar as safe haven
flows unwind. Specifically, the broad real dollar depreciates immediately 8 percent
relative to baseline, with the decline heavily concentrated against the euro, and European
economic activity increases about 1 percentage point per year faster than in the baseline
through the end of next year. The effects on U.S. real GDP are amplified by an assumed
10 percent rise in equity prices and a fall in BBB-rated corporate bond spreads of 60 basis
points. All told, U.S. real GDP increases about 1 percentage point faster, on average,
through next year. U.S. core PCE inflation rises about ½ percentage point above baseline
through the first half of 2011 in response to higher import prices and a narrower output
gap. The nominal trade balance as a percent of GDP improves about 1 percentage point
in 2011.
Stronger Recovery
In the baseline projection, we have marked down the outlook for real activity
noticeably, putting important weight on negative signals coming from abroad and from
y
n t financial markets. However, incoming data suggest that the economic recovery has

has more underlying momentum than we have assumed in the baseline. Accordingly, the
recovery in spending on household durables and business equipment, as well as outlays
for construction—both residential and nonresidential—occurs one to two years sooner
than in the baseline. In addition, financial conditions improve more quickly, with the
result that corporate equity prices are 30 percent above baseline by the end of next year,
further boosting aggregate spending. All told, real GDP expands at an average annual
rate of about 5¼ percent through the end of 2011, causing the unemployment rate to drop
to 7½ percent by late next year and to the NAIRU by the end of 2013. With less slack,
inflation is higher. Under these conditions, the federal funds rate begins to rise in mid-
2011 and remains above baseline thereafter.
Weaker Consumption
Alternatively, the recent increases in consumer spending may reflect a bounce
from unusually depressed levels. In this scenario, consumer uncertainty and further
household deleveraging push the household saving rate higher. The slower recovery in
spending, in turn, feeds back adversely on financial markets, further restraining real
activity. All told, the personal saving rate rises to 6 percent by the end of 2011—
2 percentage points above baseline; equity prices climb more modestly and, by late 2011,
are nearly 15 percent below baseline. As a consequence, the improvement in the labor
market is delayed, and the unemployment rate only declines to 9¼ percent at the end of
2011; the additional slack reduces inflation 1¼ percentage point below baseline by 2012.
Lower inflation and weaker real activity call for a longer period of accommodative
monetary policy, and the federal funds rate remains near zero until the first half of 2013.
This additional monetary stimulus, together with an assumed gradual return of spending
to long-run fundamentals, causes real GDP to expand more rapidly than in the baseline
starting in mid-2012.
Jobless Recovery
As the economic recovery continues and confidence improves, we anticipate that
firms will boost payroll employment noticeably, relieving some of the pressure on their
existing workforces and causing labor productivity to increase for a time more slowly
y
t
n
i than its trend pace. In this scenario, we instead assume that labor productivity expands
a
t
r
e through the end of next year at its trend rate of about 2½ percent per year—
c
n
U 1½ percentage points faster than in the baseline. These larger productivity gains are
&
driven by a combination of permanent shocks to structural productivity and more
s
k
s transitory factors, where the latter reflect firms’ reluctance to hire in the face of continued
i
R

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) June 16, 2010
uncertainty about the outlook. We assume that the same caution leads firms to rely more
on increases in the workweek to boost labor input than in the baseline. Finally, the
slower pace of hiring is assumed to erode household confidence. Under these
assumptions, real GDP follows its baseline path through the end of next year and the
unemployment rate remains close to 10 percent during that period. Over time,
households and firms eventually become more confident about the future and recognize
the more favorable long-run conditions implied by higher structural productivity. As that
occurs, aggregate demand picks up, and real GDP accelerates noticeably relative to
baseline after 2011. Lower unit labor costs and lower levels of resource utilization
combine to push inflation below ½ percent from mid-2011 to mid-2013. In this
environment, the federal funds rate lifts off from the effective lower bound in mid-2013,
a year later than in the baseline.
Lower Potential
The NAIRU and potential output are difficult to measure, and we could be
misjudging the degree of slack in the economy. In particular, the long-run implications
for the labor market of the sharp increases in unemployment in general, and in long-term
unemployment in particular, could be more adverse than in the baseline. Moreover, the
impairment of the financial system and its repercussions for the broader economy have
been both larger in magnitude and different in nature from what has typically occurred in
previous downturns. Reflecting these risks, in this scenario we assume that the current
level of potential output is lower than the staff assumes due to both a higher NAIRU and
a lower level of structural productivity, so that output is currently 3¼ percent below
potential, instead of 7 percent as in the baseline. These more pessimistic assumptions for
potential output imply lower long-run levels of household income and corporate earnings,
and thus less consumption and investment over time. Accordingly, real GDP expands
1¼ percentage point less per year on average through 2014 than in the baseline, and the
unemployment rate declines more slowly. Prices accelerate more noticeably than in the
baseline: Core PCE inflation rises to 1¼ percent in 2011 and moves up to 1¾ percent in
2014; this acceleration reflects both the direct effects on marginal cost of lower
productivity as well as a smaller margin of slack. Policymakers gradually take on board y
t
n
the evidence of less-favorable supply-side conditions, and in response to less slack and a i
t
r
higher inflation, monetary policy begins tightening early next year. e

Greater Disinflation
In the baseline, inflation remains relatively stable through next year and then
begins to rise as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation
expectations. But inflation expectations could prove to be less stable than we expect
given persistent weakness in labor and product markets. In this scenario, both expected
and actual inflation fall significantly, by magnitudes that are roughly in line with the
predictions of many reduced-form forecasting equations. As a result, inflation runs
below zero from 2012 on, causing the federal funds rate to remain near zero until late
2013. The more accommodative monetary policy stimulates aggregate spending, and real
GDP expands faster than in the baseline during 2013 and 2014.
Higher Inflation
Many outside forecasters anticipate higher inflation than in the staff outlook
despite similar or more pessimistic outlooks for the real economy. The “Lower
Potential” scenario described one set of factors that could lead to higher inflation than in
the staff’s projection; here we consider other possibilities. One risk is that we may be
reading too much into the recent soft inflation numbers, with the consequence that the
deceleration in underlying inflation could be more modest than we have implicitly
assumed. Another possibility is that the shift to above-trend growth will place more
upward pressure on inflation than we expect through “speed effects,” with commodity
and other prices reacting to the rate of change of activity. In this scenario, inflation
follows a path consistent with outside forecasters’ consensus, which we read as
anticipating core PCE inflation of about 1½ percent next year. In the face of this higher
inflation, the policy rule prescribes raising the federal funds rate starting in mid-2011, a
year earlier than in the baseline and closer to the interest rate outlook of some outside
forecasters. The tighter monetary policy tempers aggregate demand, so real GDP
expands somewhat more slowly than in the baseline.
OUTSIDE FORECASTS
Compared with the Blue Chip consensus forecast released in early June, the staff
y
n t forecast of real GDP growth is about the same this year but is higher next year; indeed,
i
a
t by the end of 2011, our forecast for real GDP growth is similar to that of the 10 Blue
r
e
c
n Chip respondents with the highest forecasts of real activity. Regarding inflation, private
U
& forecasters expect CPI inflation to move up to 1.9 percent in 2011, as compared with the
s
k staff forecast of 1.1 percent; by the end of 2011, our inflation outlook is similar to that
s

held by the 10 respondents with the lowest forecasts for inflation. The staff assumptions
about interest rates are below those of the Blue Chip consensus. As for revisions to the
consensus forecasts since early May, the real activity outlook is about the same, the
inflation projection has revised down a bit, and the interest rate forecasts are somewhat
lower.
