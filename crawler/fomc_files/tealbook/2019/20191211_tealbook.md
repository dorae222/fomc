Monetary Policy Alternatives
In light of the Committee’s recent policy actions, as well as communications
indicating that an adjustment at this meeting is unlikely in the absence of a material
reassessment of the economic outlook, all three of the alternative policy statements
presented below maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent.
However, the alternatives vary in their communications about the likely future path of
monetary policy.
Alternative B expresses the Committee’s judgment that, following the
adjustments made at earlier meetings, “the current stance of monetary policy is
appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market
conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.” Despite
this judgment, Alternative B emphasizes that the Committee will continue to monitor the
implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, “including global
developments and muted inflation pressures.” This latter addition signals that the
downside risk factors that had been cited as reasons for the earlier policy easings still
merit particular attention.
Alternative A expresses less confidence than Alternative B that the current stance
is appropriate to achieve the Committee’s goals by putting greater emphasis on the risk of
undesirably low inflation. In particular, it downgrades the assessment of survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations by noting that “indicators of longer-term
inflation expectations remain low.” In addition, it highlights uncertainties about the
outlook including “whether inflation will remain below 2 percent longer than expected.”
Alternative C is written in the spirit of prudent planning for future circumstances
in which the FOMC may want to signal that a rate hike is imminent. However, as data
since the October meeting—when the Committee lowered the target range—have not
prompted any material change in the economic outlook, a depiction of incoming data
since that meeting would likely be at variance with the intended policy message of
Alternative C. Consequently, the draft statement for Alternative C simply omits the first
paragraph.
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A, B, and C:

 The assessment of the incoming data:
o Alternatives A and B share the same characterizations of much of the
incoming data on the labor market and economic activity. In particular, the
two alternatives continue to describe economic growth as “moderate,”
characterize the labor market as “strong,” and the unemployment rate as
remaining “low.” Both Alternatives note that household spending “has been
rising at a strong pace,” while business fixed investment and exports “remain
weak.”
o In characterizing the incoming data on inflation, Alternative B notes that core
and headline inflation rates “are running” below 2 percent, while
Alternative A stresses that these measures “continue to run” below 2 percent.
Regarding indicators of inflation expectations, Alternative B continues to say
that market-based measures of inflation compensation “remain low” and that
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are “little
changed,” while Alternative A strikes out the corresponding sentence and
emphasizes, instead, that “indicators of longer-term inflation expectations
remain low.”
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation:
o Under all three alternatives, the outlook for economic activity and inflation is
unchanged from the October statement. However, to achieve the outcomes of
“sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,
and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective,” the
alternatives anticipate potentially different paths for the target range for the
federal funds rate.
o Alternatives B and C delete the language indicating that “uncertainties about
this outlook remain.”
 The current policy decision and the outlook for policy:
o All three alternatives maintain the current target range for the federal funds
rate.
o Under Alternative B, the Committee judges that “the current stance of
monetary policy is appropriate to support” sustained expansion of economic
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent objective. This draft statement also notes that the

Committee will continue to monitor the implications of the incoming
information for the economic outlook, with specific reference to “global
developments and muted inflation pressures.”
o Alternative A links the outlook for the policy rate predominantly to inflation.
In particular, it highlights uncertainties about the outlook including “whether
inflation will remain below 2 percent longer than expected.”
o By contrast, Alternative C offers an illustrative formulation, applicable to
circumstances in which “some reduction in the degree of monetary
accommodation may soon become appropriate.”

OCTOBER 2019 FOMC STATEMENT
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September
indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been
rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months,
and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has
been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak.
On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and
energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation
compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations are little changed.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global
developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the
Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to
1-3/4 percent. This action supports the Committee’s view that sustained
expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near
the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but
uncertainties about this outlook remain. The Committee will continue to monitor
the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses
the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.
3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2
percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and
international developments.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK
 The data released during the intermeeting period continue to suggest that economic
activity has been expanding at a moderate rate in the second half of this year. The
staff projection for real GDP growth over the short and medium term is a touch
stronger than in the October Tealbook, largely reflecting a higher projected path for
equity prices.
o Household spending rose at a strong clip through the third quarter, buoyed by
solid job gains and income growth. Recent data suggest some deceleration in
spending this quarter. Consumer sentiment remains positive.
o After increasing at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the first half of this
year, business fixed investment is projected to decline about 1.2 percent in the
second half and to edge down a bit further in the first quarter of 2020.
o Net exports are expected to be a slight drag for U.S. GDP growth in the
second half of this year. After flattening out in the third quarter, exports are
projected to resume their decline in this quarter.
 Available data indicate that the labor market remains strong. Although the pace of
payroll growth has softened this year, it continues to exceed the pace consistent with
no change in resource utilization.
o Currently published data indicate that, after rising 223,000 per month in 2018,
nonfarm payroll employment rose at an average monthly pace of nearly
167,000 this year through October. The staff estimates that the BLS
benchmark revision early next year will lower total payroll employment
growth by 42,000 per month from the second quarter of 2018 through the first
quarter of this year, and it will reduce estimates of payroll growth by 16,000
per month through the remainder of this year.
o The unemployment rate, which has hovered near 50-year lows for over a year,
stood at 3.6 percent in October. With projected output growth a bit above
potential in 2020, the staff expects the unemployment rate to tick down to
3.5 percent by the middle of next year and to remain there through the end of
2022.
o The labor force participation rate (LFPR) moved up further, to 63.3 percent, in
October and has risen 0.5 percentage point so far this year. In response to a
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 5, 2019
Page 8 of 32

--- Page 12 ---

string of unexpectedly strong LFPR readings, the staff revised up its estimate
of the trend level of participation in 2019 and over the projection period.
o After a low reading in September, growth in average hourly earnings in
October was a little stronger, but its 12-month change has edged down, on net,
over the course of this year.
 Inflation remains subdued, despite the sustained low levels of the unemployment rate.
o Core PCE prices increased 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in October.
Staff projects that this measure of inflation will run close to this level through
the end of the year and then move up to 1.9 percent by March 2020.
Thereafter, the staff expects core PCE price inflation to remain at this level, a
touch higher than in the previous forecast. Over the medium term, core
inflation runs a bit higher than the staff’s estimate of its underlying trend of
1.8 percent as the projected boost to inflation from tight resource utilization
outweighs the downward pressure on inflation arising from the influence of
the rising exchange value of the dollar on import prices.
o The staff projects that energy prices will continue to fall through next year,
and that, as a result, total PCE price inflation will run below core PCE price
inflation over that period.
o Consistent with the absence of a material tightening in the labor market over
the forecast period, the staff anticipates continued moderate wage growth over
the medium term.
o The median of long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey rose
0.2 percentage point, to 2.5 percent, in November. The Federal Reserve Bank
of New York Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of median three-
year-ahead expected inflation was unchanged in October at its historical low.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved modestly higher
since the time of the October meeting.
 Sentiment in financial markets continued to fluctuate.1

Tealbook, as well as the “Financial Market Developments” and “Risks and Uncertainty” sections of the

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty
Financial market prices and results from the Desk’s December surveys suggest that
investors perceive the likelihood of near‐term changes to the target range for the
federal funds rate to have declined over the intermeeting period. Expectations for
the path of the federal funds rate over the next few years fell modestly, on net.
Meanwhile, survey‐based measures of the longer‐run expected federal funds rate
have fallen further.
Figure 1 shows that the probability distribution for the level of the federal funds rate
following the December FOMC meeting, based on options quotes, narrowed notably
over the intermeeting period. A straight read of the distribution suggests that
investors currently attach about 90 percent probability to the target range being left
unchanged, and about 10 percent probability to a 25‐basis‐point reduction. The
corresponding average probability distribution from the December Desk surveys (not
shown) also narrowed notably and suggests similarly high odds on no change in the
target range at the upcoming meeting.
The option‐implied distribution for the level of the federal funds rate following the
January meeting (not shown) also narrowed and implies a probability of about 75
percent on the federal funds rate remaining in its current range. However, the
corresponding distribution following the March meeting, shown in figure 2, was
relatively little changed over the intermeeting period. The latter distribution suggests
that investors currently attach about equal odds to the federal funds rate falling into
either the 1.25 to 1.50 percent range or the 1.50 to 1.75 percent range.
Figure 3 shows the option‐implied probabilities, unadjusted for term premiums, of the
effective federal funds rate falling in the current target range of 1.50 percent to 1.75
percent following each of the FOMC meetings between now and September 2020.1
As discussed above, the probabilities of the federal funds rate remaining in the
current target range following the December and January FOMC meetings have risen
notably, on net, from their levels prior to the October FOMC meeting and stand at
relatively high values. However, the probabilities of the federal funds rate remaining
within its current range following subsequent meetings are relatively little changed
and are near or less than 1/3. Similar to the post‐March distribution shown in figure 2,
the option‐implied distributions for subsequent meetings (not shown) place much
higher odds on the federal funds rate being below the current target range rather
than above it.
1 Each bar shows the probability of no net change in the federal funds target range between
today and a different future meeting. For example, the bars for December 2019 and March 2020
correspond with the modal outcomes in figure 1 and figure 2, respectively.
sevitanretlA

Page 10 of 32

--- Page 14 ---

Looking further ahead, figure 4 shows the probability distribution for the level of the
federal funds rate at the end of 2020, as reported by the average respondent to the
December Desk surveys. The average respondent places the highest probability, of
about 35 percent, on the federal funds rate falling in the current target range of 1.50
to 1.75 percent. Of note, respondents assign a much higher probability to the federal
funds rate falling below the current target range (about 50 percent odds) than above
it (about 10 percent odds). This is similar to the market‐implied distributions for the
federal funds rate, which assign increasingly larger odds to a lower target range.
The blue lines in figure 5 show the expected federal funds rate path implied by OIS
quotes under the assumption of zero term premiums. Since the October FOMC
meeting, end‐2020, ‐2021, and ‐2022 forward rates fell by 9, 7, and 2 basis points,
respectively. A straight read of these market‐implied forward rates suggests that
investors expect the federal funds rate to fall about 30 basis points between now and
the end of 2020 and to remain little changed over the subsequent few years.
The median respondent to the Desk’s December surveys (the black crosses in figure 5)
reported no change in the target range as the most likely outcome through end‐2022,
although the mean expected paths implied by the average respondent (the brown
diamonds) and the staff’s macro‐finance model (the green line) lie close to the current
unadjusted forward rate path.2 In contrast, the latest path from the staff term
structure model that adjusts OIS forward rates for term premiums (the purple lines)
suggests that the federal funds rate is expected to rise gradually.
Figure 6 shows measures of the longer‐run expected federal funds rate. A straight
read of forward rates implied by Treasury yields suggests that investors’ current
expectation for the average federal funds rate 5 to 10 years ahead (the blue line) was
about unchanged over the intermeeting period, at 2.0 percent. Adjustment for term
premiums using various staff models (the light‐red‐shaded region shows a range of
four such model estimates) suggests that 5‐to‐10‐year‐ahead expectations remain
above the unadjusted forward rates, at between 2.4 and 2.9 percent. The average
longer‐run forecast from the Blue Chip survey (the yellow diamonds) declined further,
with the most recent December reading standing at 2.4 percent, about 0.7 percent
point lower than in December 2018. Meanwhile, the average longer‐run CPI forecast
from the December Blue Chip Survey (not shown) was little changed, suggesting that
longer‐run expectations of the short‐term real interest rate have declined. The
median longer‐run forecast from the Desk’s December surveys (the green diamonds)
also declined to about 2.4 percent, a touch lower than in the October surveys.
2 The staff’s macro‐finance model is discussed in the box “A Macro‐Finance Measure of Term
Premiums in Federal Funds Futures Rates” in the Financial Markets section of the April 2019
Tealbook A. The survey mean path is estimated from respondents’ unconditional probability
distributions for the year‐end federal funds rate. The difference between the mean and modal
expected federal funds rate for end‐2020 reflects the left‐skewed distribution in figure 4.

curve.
o On net, broad equity price indexes increased 2½ percent over the intermeeting
period.
o Financing conditions for businesses and households remain supportive of
spending and economic activity, on balance.
o Model-based measures of recession risks have fallen notably since the time of
the October Tealbook. The recession-probability estimate arising from a
model-averaging framework that uses a selection of both real and financial
variables was 8 percent in the November Tealbook, compared with 22 percent

manufacturing slump will fade, trade and political tensions will ease somewhat, and
accommodative policies will remain in place.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B
At the past three FOMC meetings, policymakers cited the implications of global
developments for the U.S. economic outlook and muted inflation pressures as reasons for
reducing the target range for the federal funds rate. Economic activity has been
expanding at a moderate pace, despite weak global growth and the adverse effect of trade
uncertainty on business fixed investment, exports, and manufacturing; the labor market
remains strong; inflation, while continuing to run below 2 percent, has stabilized; and the
downside risks to the economic outlook seem to have diminished somewhat.
Policymakers may consequently assess that the recent adjustments to the target range are
sufficient to support the Committee’s objectives. In addition, they may view the current
stance of monetary policy as well-calibrated to cushion the economy against adverse
factors and risks and as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information
about the economy remains broadly consistent with the current outlook.
Policymakers may see inflation rising to 2 percent over time and discern no
unwelcome upward pressure on price inflation. They may note that with the
unemployment rate projected to hover near 50-year lows, and after taking account of the
lags in the effects of the accommodation provided over the course of the year, the current
stance of policy is at a setting appropriate to support a sustained return of inflation to
2 percent.
When considering the risks to the outlook, policymakers may also note that the
likelihood of recession in the next 12 months reported from various recession-probability
models has come down significantly over this intermeeting period. Also, policymakers
may observe that the inversion in the late summer of many portions of the yield curve, to
which market commentary pointed as recession signal, has now ceased. They may see
these developments as reinforcing their view that the stance of policy is currently
appropriate—despite the asymmetric risks associated with the effective lower bound on
the policy rate. However, if developments emerge that lead to a material reassessment of
the economic outlook, the Committee may wish to indicate that it would respond
accordingly. In particular, with the resolution of the risks weighing on certain sectors of
the economy unclear, the Committee may also wish to indicate that it will continue to
monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, explicitly
referencing “global developments and muted inflation pressures.”

If policymakers choose the policy action given in Alternative B, financial market
responses to this decision would likely be relatively modest. Market prices, along with
responses to the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants indicate
that investors are nearly certain that the target range for the federal funds rate will be left
unchanged at the December meeting.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A
Alternative A conveys a somewhat greater likelihood of an additional monetary
policy easing in the future than Alternative B. Although Alternative A maintains the
current target range for the federal funds rate, it conveys more concern about the outlook
for inflation. In particular, it communicates a more downbeat interpretation of current
measures of longer-term inflation expectations, and it highlights the fact that inflation
continues to run below 2 percent and may remain below that level for longer than
expected.
Policymakers may be particularly concerned about the ongoing weakness in
inflation and inflation expectations, or view risks to the inflation outlook as significantly
weighted to the downside. If so, they may deem it appropriate to state that “Indicators of
longer-term inflation expectations remain low.”
With inflation continuing to run persistently below the Committee’s symmetric
2 percent objective, several survey-based measures of inflation expectations at or near the
lower end of their historical ranges, and market-based measures of inflation
compensation near multi-year lows, policymakers may be concerned that inflation
expectations have already moved below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent
objective. They may therefore see significant risks that inflation could fail to return to
2 percent on a sustained basis and so favor Alternative A, which states concern about
“whether inflation will remain below 2 percent longer than expected.”
Policymakers might also argue that inflation running modestly above 2 percent
for a time is needed to re-center inflation expectations on the 2 percent objective. They
may see accomplishing this re-centering before the next recession as particularly
important: Anchoring inflation expectations more solidly at 2 percent would better
enable monetary policy to provide accommodation in a future downturn. Policymakers
may see the reason for this as twofold. First, keeping long-run inflation expectations at 2
percent would help prevent an inadvertent increase in the real interest rate that would
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 5, 2019
Page 15 of 32

--- Page 19 ---

otherwise occur if inflation expectations were to fall. Second, well anchored inflation
expectations help keep nominal interest rates further away from the lower bound, thus
preserving scope for the Committee to ease policy.
A statement such as Alternative A would likely be seen by market participants as
implying a more accommodative path for the policy rate than had been anticipated. If
market participants interpret Alternative A as expressing the Committee’s desire to
provide additional accommodation so as to raise inflation to 2 percent or above, then
equity prices and inflation compensation would likely rise. However, if market
participants predominantly interpreted Alternative A as amounting to a bleaker reading of
the outlook for the economy than they had been expecting, equity prices would likely fall.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C
Alternative C illustrates the approach the Committee could consider in
circumstances in which the economy continues to perform well and the case for some
reduction in the degree of monetary accommodation has materially strengthened.
Alternative C thus signals that a rate hike is imminent.
Policymakers may note that many longer-term estimates of the real federal funds
rate from time-series models and surveys currently range between 0.3 and 1.3 percent.2
With real GDP growth continuing to run at or a bit above its potential rate, the labor
market remaining strong, and inflation expected to rise to 2 percent, policymakers may
wish to return policy to a more neutral stance over time.
Policymakers may judge that downside risks to the outlook are diminishing. The
risk of a “no-deal” Brexit has declined considerably. While the news regarding trade
negotiations has been mixed, on net, over the intermeeting period, discussions continued
between the United States and China on a trade agreement and a near-term deal could
reduce the associated trade uncertainty. Accordingly, to the extent that policymakers
view the recent reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate as insuring against
downside risks, a relatively more balanced outlook could suggest that some removal of
accommodation may soon be appropriate. In addition, with the outlook for economic
activity on a somewhat firmer footing, policymakers may judge that the risk of inflation
remaining well below the 2 percent objective is not particularly high. They may see this
2 For details see the exhibit titled “Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the
Longer Run” in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of the November Tealbook A.
sevitanretlA

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 5, 2019
Page 16 of 32

--- Page 20 ---

judgment as supported by the fact that the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ trimmed
mean PCE measure of inflation has remained at 2 percent in recent months, and by
readings on inflation expectations, which are little changed.
In addition, policymakers may regard persistently low interest rates as
endangering continued financial stability. For example, they may stress that prices in
equity and bond markets are near historical peaks, while valuation pressures in leveraged
loan and commercial real estate markets remain high. As a result, they may judge that
financial-stability considerations strengthen the case for removing over time the recently-
added accommodation.
If policymakers see a growing likelihood of a reduction in the degree of policy
accommodation, the characterization of the incoming economic data in paragraph 1
would presumably be an important means by which to signal that the economic outlook
has changed. Furthermore, in such circumstances they may also assess that it is
appropriate to signal that a “reduction in the degree of monetary accommodation may
soon become appropriate.” The Committee may judge that this kind of guidance is
associated with a reduced risk of generating a policy surprise, while preserving
optionality with regard to future rate hikes.

Implementation Note for December 2019, All Alternatives
Release Date: December 11, 2019
Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on October 30,
2019 December 11, 2019:
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to
lower maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to at
1.55 percent, effective October 31, 2019 December 12, 2019.
 As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market
Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
“Effective October 31, 2019 December 12, 2019, the Federal Open Market
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. In light
of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities,
the Committee directs the Desk to purchase continue purchasing Treasury bills
at least into the second quarter of next year 2020 to maintain over time ample
reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.
The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct continue conducting term and
overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year
2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of
sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market
pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the
Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations
(and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at
an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury
securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for
such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to
continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each
calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in
Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury
securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will
continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations
from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

--- Page 23 ---

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency
mortgage-backed securities transactions.”
 In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
[ unanimously ] to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the establishment of
the primary credit rate to at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective October 31,
2019. In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate
submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis
and San Francisco.
This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open
Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's
operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
More information regarding open market operations and reinvestments may be found on
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website.

Balance Sheet and Income Projections
The staff has prepared projections of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the
associated income statement that are consistent with the projections in Tealbook A. In
comparison to the October Tealbook, the federal funds rate projection is revised down in
the near term, while projections of longer-term interest rates are about unchanged.
Reserve balances. The path for reserves is largely unchanged relative to the
October Tealbook. As of November 2019, the level of reserve balances stood at
$1.55 trillion. Through mid-April 2020, purchases of Treasury bills and repo operations
are assumed to keep reserves at or above $1.46 trillion, the average level that prevailed in
early September (see the upper chart in the exhibit titled “SOMA Open Market
Operations and Their Near-Term Effect on Reserve Balances”).1 From May 2020
onward, reserves are projected to grow in line with nominal GDP.2
Evolution of the SOMA portfolio. As of November 2019, about $3.7 trillion of
securities are held in the SOMA portfolio, consisting of about $2.2 trillion of Treasury
securities and $1.4 trillion of agency securities (see the exhibit titled “Federal Reserve
Balance Sheet Month-end Projections—December Tealbook”).3 Consistent with the
Committee’s October 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation, we
assume that the Desk will continue to purchase Treasury bills at a pace of $60 billion per
month until mid-April.4 Thereafter, we assume that the SOMA portfolio continues to
expand in order to accommodate trend increases in reserves and in other Federal Reserve
1 Although a minimum level of $1.46 trillion of reserve balances is likely to ensure that they
remain ample through mid-April 2020, the minimum level of reserves consistent with remaining in an
ample-reserves regime is uncertain and will be reassessed as information accrues about banks’ demand for
reserve balances. These issues were discussed in the March 2019 FOMC memo, “Transitioning to an
Ample Reserves Regime with Lower Reserves.”
2 We assume that liability items other than currency, reserves, and the TGA, such as the foreign
repo pool and DFMU balances, grow in line with nominal GDP from the start of the projection period. The
projection incorporates the staff’s near-term forecast for continued repo operations through January 2020,
and incorporates the staff’s near-term forecast for TGA balances through April 2020. Thereafter, TGA
balances are assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP.
3 SOMA securities held outright include bills purchased for reserve management, but do not
include securities held temporarily through the Desk’s overnight repo operations.
4 Median expectations from the Desk’s December surveys were for bill purchases to continue at a
pace of $60 billion per month through March, and then step down over the following three months to $20
billion in June.

liabilities at a pace that is roughly in line with nominal GDP growth (see the exhibit titled
“Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items”).5 As a result of these assumptions, and
as in the previous Tealbook, the size of the balance sheet as a share of nominal GDP
remains near its current level of 19 percent through the projection horizon.
The weighted-average duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about
6.5 years. As shown in the exhibit “Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA
Treasury Securities Holdings,” the path for duration is similar to that in the October
projection. Duration is projected to decline to about 6 years by March 2020 as the share
of bills increases to 14 percent of the SOMA Treasury portfolio. The decline in duration
then decelerates, reflecting the slower pace of bill purchases.6 All told, the SOMA
Treasury portfolio attains its assumed longer-run composition, consisting of one-third
Treasury bills, in 2025:Q3, the same as in the October Tealbook.
Principal payments from holdings of agency securities are projected to exceed the
$20 billion cap on reinvestment into Treasury securities through the middle of 2020, and
fall just under $20 billion in each month for the remainder of the year (see the table and
lower charts in the exhibit titled “SOMA Open Market Operations and Their Near-Term
Effect on Reserve Balances”). Accordingly, reinvestments of agency MBS into MBS are
expected to continue through mid-2020. The share of agency MBS in the SOMA
portfolio, which currently stands at 39 percent, is expected to decline to about 11 percent
by the end of 2025. In comparison to the October Tealbook, agency MBS holdings are
expected to decline at a faster rate after 2021 (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and
Selected Balance Sheet Items”), reflecting higher forecasted prepayments.7
5 We assume that rollovers of maturing Treasury securities will continue to be directed to newly
issued securities at Treasury auctions in proportion to the maturity distribution of Treasury debt issued at
the time of rollover.
6 We continue to assume that purchases aimed at accommodating trend growth in Federal Reserve
liabilities will be directed entirely towards Treasury bills until bills constitute approximately one-third of
the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of Treasury securities, close to the pre-crisis composition. Once that
composition is reached, further purchases aimed at accommodating growth in Federal Reserve liabilities
are assumed to reflect the projected maturity distribution of Treasury securities outstanding at that time.
7 The higher forecasted prepayments are the result of switching in this Tealbook to a new model
for forecasting prepayments. The new model includes additional explanatory variables and an improved
specification to better account for some of the drivers of prepayment activity such as seasonality and
refinancing incentives over time. It is also estimated over a longer sample period with CUSIP-level data to
better characterize recent changes in mortgage markets and longer-term trends in housing markets. The
new model reduces out-of-sample forecast errors, as the previous model tended to underestimate
prepayment activity.

Correspondingly, the path for SOMA Treasury holdings has been revised upwards as
these additional principal payments from MBS holdings are reinvested into Treasury
securities.8
Unrealized gains or losses. In comparison to the October Tealbook, the path for
the unrealized position of the SOMA portfolio is largely unchanged (see the two bottom
charts in the exhibit titled “Income Projections”). The SOMA portfolio was in a net
unrealized gain position of about $195 billion at the end of October. With longer-term
interest rates projected to rise, the unrealized gain position is expected to decline over the
next few years before turning into an unrealized loss position by 2022:Q4. The position
bottoms out at an unrealized loss of around $40 billion in 2025:Q4.9
Total Term Premium Effect. As shown in the table “Projections for the 10-Year
Treasury Total Term Premium Effect (TTPE),” the securities held in the SOMA portfolio
are estimated to be reducing the term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasury yield
by 136 basis points in the current quarter, about the same as in the October Tealbook.10
Over the projection horizon, the magnitude of the downward pressure exerted on the term
premium in longer-term Treasury yields is estimated to diminish gradually, at an average
pace of about 2.5 basis points per year. The gradual decline reflects the decrease in the
duration of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over the projection horizon. At the
end of 2030, the total term premium effect of the SOMA portfolio on the 10-year
Treasury yield is estimated to be about 110 basis points. Over the projection horizon, the
SOMA portfolio is expected to exert slightly less downward pressure on Treasury term
premiums than was projected in October.
Remittances. Remittances to the Treasury are projected to decline to $54 billion
this year from $65 billion in 2018 (see the middle left chart in the exhibit titled “Income
Projections”). This reduction mainly reflects lower interest income resulting from the
reduction in SOMA securities holdings through September 2019. Total interest expense
8 We assume that reinvestments of principal payments from agency securities holdings into
Treasury securities continue to be spread across the maturity spectrum of outstanding Treasury securities
for the entire projection period.
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “What Does It Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (June 2018) for an explanation of the accounting concepts underlying
unrealized and realized gain and loss positions, as well as their implications for the Federal Reserve’s
ability to meet its obligations.
10 The overall 10-year Treasury term premium is assumed to gradually approach its long-run value
of 50 basis points.

is projected to be $41 billion this year, slightly lower than in 2018.11 Remittances are
expected to increase to $65 billion next year, and remain roughly flat through 2022.
Remittances are then expected to increase for the rest of the projection period, reflecting
higher net interest income associated with a growing balance sheet, as yields on longer-
term securities in the SOMA portfolio exceed the rate paid on reserve balances. In
comparison with the October Tealbook, the projected path for remittances is slightly
higher through 2020, largely reflecting the revised path for interest expense tied to the
downward revision in the federal funds rate path. Thereafter, the path for remittances is
projected to be slightly lower than in the previous Tealbook.
11 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 basis point-wide target range for the federal
funds rate throughout the projection period. Consistent with the FOMC’s September 2019 Implementation
Note, we assume that the IOER rate will be set 20 basis points below the top of the target range, and the
offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set 5 basis points below the bottom of the range for the rest of the
projection period.
