Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Although the escalation of trade tensions and rising concerns about global growth D
n
have roiled financial markets both here and abroad in recent weeks, the domestic data o
c
E
releases have been relatively anodyne and continue to suggest economic activity is c
ti
s
expanding at a solid pace this year. GDP increased 2.5 percent in the first half, and the e
m
latest readings on consumer spending and the labor market shore up our expectation of o
D
moderate output gains in the second half—despite anticipated declines in business
investment. We are currently writing down average growth of 1.8 percent in the second
half as our baseline projection. That said, when we tote up the risks that seem the most
salient—including further worsening of trade tensions and adverse political and economic
developments abroad—they are clearly slanted to the downside.
Although these downside risks extend beyond this year, our modal projection
continues to call for only a modest further deceleration in economic activity that largely
reflects a waning impetus from fiscal policy. After increasing 2.1 percent this year, GDP
growth is expected to slow steadily over the forecast period to 1.7 percent in 2022. We
project essentially no further labor market tightening after 2019, with the unemployment
rate holding steady at 3.6 percent over the next few years.
Relative to the July Tealbook, GDP growth is revised somewhat lower in
response to weaker data on net exports, our outlook for foreign growth, a stronger dollar,
and lower readings on expected longer-run profits. The cumulative effect of these factors
was only partly offset by a lower path for interest rates and a large upward revision to
disposable personal income in recent quarters. Combined with some updates to our
aggregate supply assumptions for the past few years—namely, a reduction in our natural
rate of unemployment and a higher level of structural productivity—these changes to the
forecast led to a sizable reduction in our assessment of the economy’s tightness. All told,
we now project that the output gap will be 1.4 percent by the end of the projection period,
0.7 percentage point narrower than our earlier estimate.
Monthly readings on core PCE prices were higher over the April to July period
than in the first quarter, and we continue to anticipate that the 12-month change in core
prices will move up from the latest reading of 1.6 percent in July to 1.8 percent by the
end of 2019. We now expect core inflation to remain at 1.8 percent through the medium

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
e
D the June FOMC meeting. The following table compares the staff’s current economic
n
o projection with the one we presented in the June Tealbook.
c
E
c Trade tensions, global growth concerns, and financial market conditions have fluctuated
ti
e s notably since the June forecast, but our projections for slowing GDP growth and an
m
unemployment rate that essentially moves sideways over the medium term are quite similar.
o
D
On balance, GDP at the end of 2022 is slightly higher and the unemployment rate is a bit
lower than in June. Even so, the output gap is now projected to roughly flatten out at a
lower level, as we have revised up our assumption for potential output—largely reflecting a
downward revision to our assumed natural rate of unemployment from 4.6 percent to
4.4 percent—in the current projection.
The less-tight resource utilization shows through to slightly lower projected inflation over
the medium term relative to the June Tealbook. Core inflation is forecast to move sideways
at 1.8 percent—equal to our estimate of underlying inflation—as the effects of still-tight
resource utilization are offset by an appreciating dollar. Total inflation is forecast to run in
line with core inflation after this year, because energy prices are projected to become less of
a drag on inflation.
The assumed path for the federal funds rate is currently a bit lower than in June, reflecting
the FOMC’s decision to reduce the federal funds rate target in July, along with the smaller
output gap and lower inflation in the current projection.

EE KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
cc

ss
ee
mm Monetary Policy
oo
DD
 The baseline policy rule calls for the federal funds rate to hold steady this year
at 2.2 percent and then to edge up gradually, reaching 2.5 percent by the end
of 2022. In contrast, term-premium-adjusted market quotes suggest market
participants expect the federal funds rate to decline roughly 50 basis points by
the end of 2020, with most of the decline occurring this year.
 Our assumptions for the SOMA portfolio, which will be detailed in Tealbook
B, imply that downward pressure on the term premium in Treasury yields
diminishes over time.
Other Interest Rates and Equity Prices
 The 10-year Treasury yield dropped sharply over the intermeeting period.
Staff models attribute much of the decline to a decrease in the term premium
to a level that is quite low historically. In our projection, we continue to
assume that the term premium will rise to a more normal level over the next
few years. However, we are assuming that the increase will happen more
slowly in this projection because of more persistent downward pressure
coming from global growth concerns, foreign monetary policy, and
uncertainty regarding international trade. By the end of 2022, we look for the
10-year rate to be around 2.8 percent.
 The spreads of both the triple-B corporate bond yield and mortgage rates over
the 10-year Treasury yield have widened in recent weeks. We expect the
wider spreads to persist through the beginning of next year and so have
revised down these rates by less than the Treasury yield for the next few
quarters.
 Stock prices have declined 2 percent since the time of the July Tealbook. We
now expect stock prices to appreciate a bit more over the forecast than we did

reduction in valuation pressures. Relative to the July Tealbook, equity prices

are slightly lower for most of the projection. e l

Trade Policy
o
c
E
 On September 1, the United States imposed a new tariff of 15 percent on c
ti
about $100 billion of imports from China. These particular categories of e s
m
goods had not been previously affected by the tariff increases that had been o
D
implemented over the past two years. Also, on September 1, China boosted
tariffs on nearly $30 billion of U.S. exports. Most of these tariff increases
were applied to goods that had already experienced tariff hikes in 2018 or
2019. The tariffs on U.S. exports will likely be accompanied by additional
nontariff barriers to trade.
 By themselves, this latest round of tariffs should reduce the level of U.S. GDP
by the end of 2021 by 5 basis points and boost U.S. core PCE prices by a
similar amount. We estimate that the cumulative effect of these and past tariff
changes will lower the level of U.S. GDP 30 basis points by the end of 2021
and boost the level of core PCE prices 30 basis points. These estimated
effects reflect only the direct effects of higher tariffs and do not include any
indirect effects arising from greater trade policy uncertainty.
 As usual, the current Tealbook forecast conditions only on tariff increases that
have already been implemented. The United States has also announced plans
for additional tariff increases in the coming months: On October 1, the tariffs
already in place on $230 billion of imports from China are scheduled to rise
from 25 to 30 percent. On December 15, about $150 billion of previously
unaffected imports are scheduled to receive a 15 percent tariff, effectively
extending the recent tariff hikes to almost all imports from China. Likewise,
China plans to boost tariffs on $45 billion of goods on December 15.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 Foreign GDP increased about 2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter
and is expected to remain near this below-potential pace throughout the
second half of this year. The near-term outlook has been revised down,
reflecting disappointing data in several economies. We expect foreign growth

 Since the July Tealbook, the dollar appreciated 3.5 percent against EME E

currencies and 1.2 percent against AFE currencies. We continue to expect s

that, as market expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff
o
D
forecast, the broad real dollar will appreciate at an annual rate of about
1 percent through 2022. All told, the path of the dollar is about 2 percent
higher than in the July Tealbook.
Fiscal Policy
 As we had expected, federal fiscal policymakers recently enacted legislation
to increase the discretionary spending caps for fiscal years 2020 and
2021. See the box “The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019” for additional details.
 Under our fiscal policy assumptions, the direct fiscal impetus from all levels
of government contributes 0.7 percentage point to aggregate demand growth
this year—about the same as in 2018—before tapering to 0.4 percentage point
in 2020 and to a little less than 0.2 percentage point in 2021 and 2022. This
contour is little changed relative to the July Tealbook.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
 Oil prices are little changed in this projection, as the drag on prices from
concerns about global growth and trade tensions has been about offset by
upward pressure from a sharp decline in Iranian oil exports combined with
continued production declines in other OPEC nations.
 Agricultural prices have fallen 9 percent since the previous Tealbook to their
lowest level in a decade, driven largely by a USDA report indicating that U.S.
crop production may be better than previously expected despite remaining
depressed due to poor weather earlier in the year. Ongoing trade tensions
between the United States and China have also depressed agricultural prices
and U.S. exports. (The box “Developments in the U.S. Agricultural Sector”
provides additional background.)

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019
&&
ll
ee The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019) was signed into law on August 2. The legislation
vv
ee
DD increased the caps that constrain federal discretionary budget authority in both fiscal years 2020
nn and 2021 to about $1.37 trillion.1 Notably, the agreement eliminated the risk that budget authority
oo
EE cc in fiscal 2020 and 2021 would be constrained by the caps agreed to under the Budget Control Act
ttii cc of 2011, which were about $150 billion lower. In addition to increasing the caps for the next two
ss
ee years, the BBA 2019 suspended the statutory federal debt limit through July 31, 2021.
mm
oo
DD
Although the BBA 2019 set higher nominal caps on budget levels, the spending is not authorized
until legislators pass, and the President signs, fiscal 2020 and 2021 appropriations bills. Should the
Congress and the Administration fail to reach an agreement on the necessary appropriations bills
by the beginning of fiscal 2020 (October 1), they will need to pass a continuing resolution that
temporarily extends funding in order to avoid a government shutdown.2
The new budget caps are about $25 billion higher relative to the fiscal 2019 caps and support
aggregate demand through their effect on government purchases. If enacted budget authority is
set at the cap levels—as we expect and as has been the case in recent years—then we project
that federal discretionary spending will rise a little faster than inflation, on average, over the next
couple of years.3 Specifically, the staff now expects that real federal purchases will increase
1.2 percent in 2020 and move roughly sideways in 2021 (table, line 1). In terms of contributions to
real GDP growth, the staff estimates that the direct first-round effect of federal purchases on
aggregate demand will be about 0.3 percentage point in 2019, step down to 0.1 percentage point
in 2020, and be roughly neutral in 2021 (line 3), close to the previous Tealbook (line 4).4
1 Some funding for discretionary spending is not subject to the caps, including appropriations designated
for overseas contingency operations (such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq) and disaster relief. In fiscal 2019,
those categories totaled $116 billion in budget authority.
2 Recall that the partial federal government shutdown last December and January began when the
Congress and the Administration were unable to pass appropriations bills for fiscal 2019 despite having already
agreed to budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
3 Within a fiscal year, government agencies generally sign contracts for goods and services that commit
to spending that year’s budget authority. However, a significant share of the purchases of goods and services
typically occurs in subsequent fiscal years. To estimate the timing of purchases, we rely on estimates of budget
authority spendout rates from the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of Defense.
4 To place these projected aggregate demand effects in a historical context, since 1979 the average
annual contribution of federal purchases to the rate of change in real GDP is about 0.15 percentage point.

THE OUTLOOK FOR GDP E
c
ti
s
e
The contrast we observed in the first half of the year—between strong consumer m
o
spending and slowing business investment—looks likely to be more pronounced in the D
second half of the year: We are forecasting that consumption growth will remain strong,
but we are penciling in an outright decline in business investment. These patterns, along
with the waning of an anomalous first-half boost in government spending, point to a
slowdown in GDP growth from a healthy 2.5 percent pace in the first half to a more
moderate 1.8 percent increase in the second half.
 Recent data on consumer spending have been positive, with personal
consumption expenditures posting a solid gain in July after rising at a nearly
3 percent pace in the first half. We expect growth in consumer spending to
average 2.7 percent in the second half, reflecting recent strong readings on
retail sales and light vehicle sales, as well as the support of continued solid
gains in labor income.1 We took only a small negative signal from the recent
decline in the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment, as the
Conference Board’s measure remains elevated. If the lower level of the
Michigan measure persists, we are likely to further temper our forecast for
spending.
 After having declined for six consecutive quarters, residential investment is
expected to increase in the second half at a rate of 4 percent, boosted by the
decline in mortgage rates since late 2018. The expected increase is
corroborated by measures of builder and homebuyer sentiment, which have
rebounded from their lows around the turn of the year, and by single-family
permits and pending sales, which have moved up, on net, in recent months.
1 The growth of personal income in the first quarter was revised up substantially in the BEA’s
recent annual revision. Wage data from ADP indicate that the upward revision reflected large increases in
bonuses and exercised stock options. Because these are received by high-income consumers who tend to
have a low marginal propensity to consume, we responded only with a small boost to consumption in the
forecast period.

Developments in the U.S. Agricultural Sector
&&
ll
ee
vv The performance of the U.S. agricultural sector has been relatively subdued in
ee
DD
recent years against a backdrop of fairly strong GDP growth. As shown in figure 1,
nn
oo nominal farm income was elevated from 2011 to 2013, reflecting strong export
cc
EE
demand and elevated prices for agricultural commodities. Beginning in 2014,
cc
ttii
however, prices for major agricultural commodities dropped sharply and led to
ss
ee
mm declines in farm income over the next few years. With prices for farm commodities
oo
having remained low, farm income is projected to rise only modestly this year, even
DD
after accounting for the increased support from direct government payments
related to trade policies. The farm income figures for 2019 are USDA projections.
Some private-sector analysts have indicated that the 2019 forecast appears overly
optimistic and is likely to be marked down as more complete data become
available.
Over 2000 to 2014, U.S. agricultural exports increased almost 200 percent, with
significant increases in exports to China (figure 2). Since then, however, U.S.
agricultural exports have weakened, on average, as foreign production has risen
strongly. Moreover, amid ongoing trade tensions, exports to China dropped
sharply in 2018 and have fallen further so far this year. For example, the value of
U.S. soybean exports to China dropped approximately 75 percent in 2018 compared
with the previous year, and the pace in the first half of 2019 has remained
unchanged from a year ago. Given recent trade tensions, China now buys most of
its soybeans from Brazil, a pattern that some industry analysts suggest may become
permanent and have long-lasting negative implications for U.S. producers.

The low prices for agricultural products, which have been holding down farm e
D
income, have persisted this year as global supplies of agricultural commodities have n
o
continued to outpace demand and inventories of agricultural commodities carried c
E
over from previous seasons are expected to remain high. At the same time, c
ti
adverse weather conditions have led to domestic production disturbances. Most e s
m
notably, an unusually wet spring and severe flooding across large portions of the
o
Midwest this year led to significant planting delays and prospects of reduced U.S. D
crop production, which we currently estimate will hold down GDP growth by
0.1 percentage point this year. Recent data suggest that more than 10 percent of
planned U.S. corn and soybean acreage may have gone unplanted in 2019 because
of weather-related disruptions.
Reduced incomes and cash flow shortages have led to weaker financial conditions
in the agricultural sector in recent years, although the situation appears less dire
than in the 1980s, a period often referred to as the U.S. Farm Crisis. Agricultural
borrowing from various lending institutions has increased, though the rise in
delinquency rates on agricultural loans thus far has been modest. Relative strength
in the value of farm real estate has also provided support to producers’ balance
sheets, as farmland accounts for more than 80 percent of total assets in the U.S.
farm sector. That said, farmers’ liquidity appears exceptionally low by historical
standards, raising concerns about their ability to withstand a potential downturn in
demand.
In the coming years, U.S. farm income growth is projected to remain subdued. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that farm income will rise at an average
annual rate of just 0.2 percent over the next 10 years, with the price of major
agricultural commodities generally remaining flat because of limited prospects for
significant demand growth and persistently high global production. Climate change
is often cited as a primary risk to global agricultural production and could lead to
more volatile swings in commodity prices in the future.
Amid these ongoing economic and financial challenges, productivity growth in the
U.S. farm sector has remained high. From 2007 to 2017, multifactor productivity
increased at an average annual pace of 1.2 percent in the U.S. crop and livestock
industries, compared with 0.3 percent in the nonfarm U.S. economy. The strength
in productivity has continued to encourage investment and expansion among
agribusinesses, agricultural service firms, and businesses specializing in
transportation and logistics.

 Manufacturing production moved down further in July after declining at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent in the first half. We estimate that a substantial share
of the downturn in factory output this year is due to the direct effects of tariffs
imposed over the past year. The drag from tariffs is likely to persist, and
national indexes of new export orders turned markedly negative in August.
Even so, we project that overall manufacturing output will be little changed
through year-end, as the sector is supported, in part, by higher production of
motor vehicles than in the first half of the year.
 Exports continued to decline in the first half of this year, consistent with the
stronger dollar, tepid foreign growth, retaliatory tariffs against the United
States, and delayed aircraft exports. We project that the increased tariffs that
have already been implemented by the United States and its trading partners
will continue to depress both export and import growth through the near term.
In addition, both the strong dollar and weak foreign growth should weigh on
exports. Hence, after having been a neutral influence on GDP growth in the
first half of the year, net exports will likely be a slight drag on growth in the
second half.
The key question for our medium-term projection is how the recent escalation in
trade tensions, as well as signs of more persistent weakness in foreign growth, will affect
economic activity. As a starting point, we have taken on board the stronger dollar and
weaker foreign growth (which are negatives for the outlook) as well as the lower interest
rates (a positive) as we typically do, on an other-things-equal basis. But we also need to
make sure our projection has appropriately taken on board the factors driving the
financial market changes in the first place. With that in mind, and influenced by a further
reduction in analysts’ longer-run profit expectations, we took down our projection a bit
more than the other-things-equal calculation above would call for. However, our

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY o
c
E
c
The labor market has tightened a bit further so far this year but at a slower pace ti
s
e
than last year. Although published payroll gains have been slowing, the unemployment m
o
rate has edged down, on net, from the end of 2018, and the employment-to-population D
ratio has moved up a little. However, we project essentially no further tightening of the
labor market after this year.
 After rising at an average monthly pace of 163,000 during the first half, total
nonfarm payrolls rose 159,000 in July and 130,000 in August.2 These latest
readings were below our expectations in the July Tealbook but above the
monthly gains of 95,000 to 125,000 that we estimate are needed to keep labor
utilization constant.3 We expect payroll gains to average 131,000 from
September through December and to continue to step down over the medium
term, reaching a pace of 65,000 in 2022, as GDP growth slows. Compared
with the July Tealbook, monthly payroll growth is revised down by 20,000 to
30,000 throughout the medium term.
o Based on the BLS’s preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision to
payroll employment released last month, we anticipate that next
February’s annual payroll revisions will reduce payroll gains from
April 2018 to March 2019 by an average of about 42,000 per month.4
As a result, we expect that the average monthly gain in payroll
employment for 2018 will be revised down from 223,000 per month,
as currently published, to about 190,000 per month, a pace that is
similar to the average for 2017. In addition, we anticipate that revised
2 Temporary hiring by the Census Bureau added 25,000 to the gain in nonfarm payrolls in August.
3 This is the range that would be, on average, consistent with no change in the unemployment rate
and a decline in the participation rate in line with its trend over the next year.
4 Each year, the BLS benchmarks its sample-based estimate of the level of payroll employment in
March to the level of employment based on the universe of firms reporting to their states’ unemployment
insurance systems. The universe-based count fully captures the employment effects of firm births and
deaths, while the currently published monthly employment changes since the previous benchmark in March
2018 are based on a statistical model of births and deaths.

D
o Gains in private payrolls derived from microdata from the payroll-
processing firm ADP have also slowed since last year, and to a
somewhat larger extent than in the published BLS data, on average, so
far this year.
o Initial claims for unemployment insurance, which are a reliable early
indicator of a downturn, have been little changed in recent months at a
very low level.
 The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent in August. We expect
the unemployment rate to remain at this level through the end of 2019 and
then to edge down to 3.6 percent, staying at that level through 2022, a path
that is similar to our projection in the July Tealbook.
 The LFPR rose to 63.2 percent in August from 63.0 percent in July, boosted
by a jump in prime-age female participation. We expect that the LFPR will
decline over the projection period, as the ongoing aging of the working-age
population is no longer offset by cyclical improvement in participation.
 We estimate that output per hour in the business sector increased at a
2.9 percent rate in the first half of this year, well above its pace in 2018. This
recent surge likely overstates the true gains in productivity, as it reflects, in
large part, a steep decline in self-employed hours, which are a poorly
measured and volatile component of aggregate hours; indeed, self-employed
hours increased in both July and August. We expect productivity to grow
around 1¼ percent through the medium term.

Tealbook. To be clear, the information we use to pin down the natural rate of
unemployment—residuals from our wage and price inflation equations, data
on the demographic and educational composition of the workforce, and
various measures of labor market efficiency and tightness—cannot neatly
distinguish between 4.4 percent and 4.6 percent. With this change, we have
judged that a balanced assessment is one that puts a little more weight on the
indicators calling for a lower natural rate.
 We also raised our estimate of structural productivity growth in recent years,
and the level at the end of 2018 is ¼ percent higher than in the July
Tealbook. In the past, actual productivity has tended to fall below trend in a
tight economy, possibly reflecting individuals with below-average human
capital being drawn into the labor force. With the higher trend in this forecast,
actual productivity in recent years now appears more consistent with past
experience.
 With these changes, we have addressed some tensions that have arisen over
the past year between our view of resource utilization and data on the labor
market and productivity. All told, we now estimate the level of potential
output at the end of 2018 to stand 0.5 percent higher than in the July
Tealbook, a revision that contributed meaningfully to the lower output gap
mentioned in the introduction.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Core PCE inflation is projected to move up to 1.8 percent by the end of this year.
We project core inflation to stay at that level through the medium term—equal to our
estimate of underlying inflation—as the effects of tight resource utilization are offset by

o
an appreciating dollar. Total PCE inflation is expected to be in line with core inflation t l
u
O
after this year, as energy prices become less of a drag on the inflation projection.
&
l
e
v
 Core PCE prices rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. This e
D
n
figure is a little below that in the July Tealbook due to downwardly revised o
c
E
monthly readings on nonmarket prices in the first part of the year. As we
c
ti
anticipated, low monthly readings on core inflation from early in the year s
e
m
have proven transitory. We expect core inflation to move up to 1.7 percent in o
D
August and to increase to 1.8 percent later this year, as core inflation is
boosted by tariff increases.
o Alternative measures of inflation also indicate that the weakness
earlier this year was transitory. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean
measure of inflation rose 2.0 percent in the 12 months ending in July,
similar to readings recorded late last year. In addition, a staff estimate
of core PCE inflation excluding idiosyncratic price changes was
1.7 percent in July, also little changed from its level late last year.
 We estimate that the effective price for imported core goods (which includes
the effects of tariffs) was about unchanged in the first half of the year,
somewhat less than we expected in the July Tealbook, as falling prices for
imported foods and metals offset a boost from the increased tariffs on imports
from China. For the second half of the year, we expect effective core import
price inflation to step up to 1.6 percent, as the higher tariffs more than offset
the effects of the appreciating dollar and lower commodity prices. After this
year, core import price inflation is expected to be subdued—reflecting an
appreciating dollar and the fading effects of the recent tariff increases—and to
hold down domestic prices.
 Median long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey edged up to
2.6 percent in August. This measure has moved roughly sideways since 2016
despite fluctuating within a somewhat wider range in 2019 than in previous
years. By contrast, the FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of
median three-year-ahead expected inflation edged down, as did TIPS-based
measures of longer-term inflation compensation.

Platform Gig Workers in the U.S. Economy
&&
ll
ee
vv Over the past decade, the use of online platforms to match workers to short-term jobs,
ee
DD
or “gigs,” has grown rapidly. Workers on these platforms provide labor to generate
nn
oo income and might also use their own capital—for example, by driving their own cars for
cc
EE
delivery or chauffer services or by renting their properties to travelers. Although
cc
ttii
informal work has been a long-standing characteristic of the labor market, gig platforms
ss
ee
mm have expanded because they are easy for workers to join and provide efficient and
oo flexible ways of locating and transacting with customers. At the same time, platform gig
DD
work has raised concerns because it is thought to be associated with little job security
and a lack of employer-provided benefits. Here we describe recent findings about the
size of the platform gig workforce and the characteristics of such work and workers.
Currently, because of its small size, platform gig work appears to have a limited influence
on the overall labor market, but its prevalence will likely increase in the future as new
platforms enter and existing ones expand.
Although gig platforms are widely available, only a small fraction of U.S. workers
currently engages in platform-related gig work; estimates range from 1 to 5 percent of
the U.S. workforce.1 Notably, since individuals participate in gig work sporadically over
time, the number of platform gig workers is higher on an annual basis than at shorter
frequencies. For example, a study of Chase checking account holders finds that the
majority of platform gig participants earn gig income in only a few months out of the
year.2
For most platform participants, gig work appears to be a secondary source of income.
For instance, a study of IRS personal income tax data shows that for the majority of gig
platform participants, earnings reported on W-2 forms are much greater than those from
gig work reported on 1099 forms.3 Similarly, in the 2018 Survey of Household Economics
and Decisionmaking (SHED), respondents more commonly report that gig work provides
a supplemental rather than a primary source of income.4 While gigs tend to be a small
1 Some other research has focused on contingent workers, defined as workers who do not expect
their jobs to last. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that these workers, some of whom may work
platform gigs, accounted for 4 percent of employment in its 2017 survey, similar to the share in 2005.
See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018), “Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangements—May
2017,” press release, June 7, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/conemp.pdf.

share of income on an annual basis, a 2018 study found that platform gig work provides O
about half of workers’ household income in the months they work on these gigs.5 &
l
e
v
Platform gig workers differ in several respects from the typical U.S. employee. First, the e
D
workplaces, hours, and earnings of gig workers are generally more variable than those of n
o
wage and salary employees. This flexibility has some advantages: Gig workers typically c
E
set their own schedules and can work more on a given day or opt out for weeks or c
ti
months at a time. However, as independent contractors, platform gig workers do not e s
m
receive employer-provided medical insurance or paid sick leave and are not covered by
o
unemployment insurance, have no guarantee of minimum wage or overtime pay, and D
limited protection from discrimination or other unfair practices. Second, platform gig
workers tend to be younger than the overall workforce; male and black workers are also
overrepresented among platform workers. In addition, some evidence suggests that
workers with college degrees are overrepresented in platform workers, although the
2018 SHED finds that less-educated workers are more likely to rely on gigs as their
primary source of income.6 Finally, transportation platforms, such as Uber and Lyft,
account for a large share of platform gig employment and income, and these gigs are
concentrated in large cities and tourist destinations. On the whole, platform gigs are
more prevalent in densely populated areas, whereas small cities and rural areas have less
platform gig work.
Future growth in platforms would likely make platform work increasingly available to
individuals looking to work more hours. As a result, even though platform gig work may
be more unstable than traditional employment, the ability to substitute platform gigs for
traditional work could make individual income and spending more resilient to temporary,
idiosyncratic reductions in income from traditional jobs. However, some types of
workers will likely continue to face higher barriers to participating in platform gig work.
For example, it seems likely that older individuals and those in rural areas will continue to
be underrepresented in platform gig work, at least for the foreseeable future, and less
able to use it to ensure against reductions in other sources of income.7 Moreover, we do
not know how the availability of platform gig work would change in an economic
downturn. If demand for platform gigs declines along with the demand for traditional
jobs, then platform gig work may be unable to offset reductions in traditional
employment during recessions to the same extent as in expansions.
5 See Farrell, Greig, and Hamoudi, Online Platform Economy in 2018 in note 2.
6 For data on participation in electronically mediated work by education level, see Bureau of Labor
Statistics (2018), “Electronically Mediated Work: New Questions in the Contingent Worker
Supplement,” Monthly Labor Review, September, https://doi.org/10.21916/mlr.2018.24.
7 In the 2019 paper “Is Gig Work Replacing Traditional Employment?” (see note 3), Collins and
others show that, relative to the total workforce, older individuals and those in rural areas are
underrepresented in platform gigs but overrepresented in nonplatform gigs, which suggests that these
types of individuals have less access to platform gigs.

o In the current projection, we have maintained our view that underlying t l
u
O
inflation is 1.8 percent and that it will hold steady at this level over the
&
medium term. This assumption is informed by a variety of statistical e l
v
e
models, some of which incorporate information on inflation D
n
expectations. o
c
E
c
We project that hourly compensation will increase moderately over the medium s
ti
e
m
term.
o
D
 Compensation per hour, which is more cyclically sensitive and much noisier
than other measures of compensation, surged in the first half of this year.
However, we believe this jump is transitory, in part because wage data from
ADP suggest gains in compensation in the first quarter were driven by
bonuses and stock option exercises. As a result, we expect compensation per
hour to rise 5.3 percent this year but to increase 3.5 percent per year, on
average, over the medium term.
 The employment cost index (ECI), which excludes stock options, rose
2.6 percent in the 12 months ending in June, down a bit from three months
earlier. We expect the ECI to maintain this pace through the end of the
projection period.
 Average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in
August, the same as over the preceding 12 months. We expect growth in
average hourly earnings to be near this pace through the near term.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We assume that the natural rate of unemployment is 4.4 percent over the
longer run, 0.2 percentage point lower than in the July Tealbook. We
continue to assume that potential output growth will slow after 2021 to
1.7 percent per year in the longer run, as the boost to potential growth from
the 2017 tax cuts wanes.
 We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equilibrium federal
funds rate will be 0.5 percent. The nominal yield on 10-year Treasury
securities is 3.4 percent in the longer run.

points in the long run.
 GDP growth averages slightly below its long-run value of 1.7 percent from
2023 through 2025 and rises gradually to its long-run value thereafter. The
unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3.6 percent at the end of 2022
toward its assumed natural rate in subsequent years. Core PCE price inflation
remains at 1.9 percent for many years before converging eventually to its
long-run value of 2.0 percent.
 Given the outlook for inflation and resource utilization, the nominal federal
funds rate remains close to its long-run value of 2.5 percent from the end of
the medium term onward.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Despite the buzz about a global recession, we do not see one around the corner.
Notwithstanding the trade tensions and a continued slump in manufacturing, services—
which account for the largest share of activity in most advanced economies—are holding
up relatively better, and most economies are set for further expansion. But there is hardly
cause to be sanguine. We have revised down our foreign outlook yet again and now see
economic growth abroad holding steady below potential in the second half of the year
rather than picking up modestly as projected in the July Tealbook. Moreover, downside
k
o
risks have increased noticeably amid another escalation of trade tensions, despite some o
l
t
abatement of the political turmoil in Hong Kong and Italy. The prospects for Brexit u
O
&
remain highly uncertain.
l
e
v
e
D
Incoming GDP data put foreign growth in the second quarter at 2.1 percent at an
n
o
annual rate, a touch higher than we were expecting in the July Tealbook. Growth in c
E
Brazil, Canada, and Japan was stronger than expected, but this positive surprise was ’ l
t
n
I
largely offset by downward surprises in Germany, Hong Kong, and the United
Kingdom—where output contracted—and in several other emerging market economies
(EMEs). Third-quarter indicators have generally disappointed, including for much-
watched Germany and China as well as for Canada. We now see aggregate foreign
growth remaining at about 2 percent in the second half of the year (0.3 percentage point
lower than in the July Tealbook) as some recovery in the EMEs is roughly offset by
slower growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). Moreover, the pickup in
EMEs is predicated on sustained recoveries in Brazil and Mexico, which are hardly
assured at this point.
We expect foreign growth to edge up to about 2.5 percent next year, close to
potential, and remain about there over the forecast period. We assume that the drag from
several factors that have weighed on foreign growth, including trade policy uncertainty
and the global manufacturing slump (the latter is discussed in the box “Weakness in the
Global Manufacturing Sector”), will ease, consistent with the recent industrial production
strength in emerging Asia excluding China. Highly accommodative monetary policies
should also provide support.

Weakness in the Global Manufacturing Sector
Global manufacturing activity has been weakening since 2018 (red line in figure 1). Moreover, this
weakness has become increasingly widespread, with manufacturing purchasing managers indexes
(PMIs) indicating contractions (below 50) in the majority of countries for which we have data. In
contrast, the service sector has performed relatively better (blue line in figure 1), with service PMIs
indicating contractions in only a few countries. Because movements in the manufacturing PMI can
be followed by more generalized downturns in economic activity, the manufacturing slowdown
warrants close attention. 1 In this discussion, we present evidence that a global investment
slowdown—perhaps triggered by the surge in trade policy uncertainty—is an important
contributor to the weakness in the global manufacturing sector.2
The downturn in global manufacturing activity has coincided with a global investment slowdown.
k
o Both industrial production (IP) (red line in figure 2) and investment growth (blue line in figure 2)
o
t l have trended down since 2018, with the latter reaching its lowest level since the Global Financial
u
O Crisis. This investment downturn has also been widespread, with more than three-fourths of the
&
economies in our sample—among them China, Germany, and the United Kingdom—experiencing
l
e
v a deceleration. Moreover, as shown in figure 3, the contribution of capital goods (green bars) to
e
D growth of global IP has fallen markedly since 2017, which provides further evidence of the
n
o importance of investment in dragging down global manufacturing activity.
c
E
l
t ’ What accounts for this manufacturing and investment slowdown? A likely explanation is that
n
I trade tensions, although concentrated in the United States and China, have had wider
international spillovers. For instance, recently imposed tariffs and uncertainty about future tariffs
could be weighing on global manufacturing activity through supply chain connections, and
1 For example, manufacturing PMIs tend to lead services PMIs.
2 A recent memo by the Board staff finds that the direct effect of tariff increases accounts for about half of
the recent deceleration in U.S. manufacturing industrial production. See Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce (2019),
“Effects of Recent Tariffs on Manufacturing Output,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, Division of Research and Statistics, August 26.

heightened uncertainty about future tariffs is likely depressing investment. Both investment and
manufacturing started to turn down in 2018 when trade tensions intensified. Figure 4 shows that
decreases in manufacturing PMIs have been larger in those countries with higher trade openness,
consistent with the hypothesis that trade tensions are weighing on manufacturing activity and
investment. The IEDO box “The Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty on Global Economic Activity,”
attempts to quantify the drag of trade policy uncertainty on global activity.
Besides trade tensions, other more idiosyncratic factors have likely contributed to the weakness
of manufacturing as well. First, European auto production remains sluggish, as German
manufacturers have failed to bounce back from the introduction of more stringent emission
standards in the summer of 2018. Second, Chinese domestic demand has weakened, in part
because of the country’s deleveraging campaign, leading to knock-on effects for its major trade
k
partners. For example, weak global demand for electronic products, driven in large part by China, o
o
has caused a sharp slowdown in emerging Asia’s technology sector. Finally, it is possible that t l
u
some still unidentified factor is weighing on global manufacturing. O

However, downside risks around this outlook have increased. First, trade policy
uncertainty (TPU) ratcheted up again as the United States and China implemented further
tariff increases in September and threatened even more later in the year. Our
econometric estimates of the effects of TPU on global growth suggest that the most
recent spike in TPU would reduce global growth about 0.1 percentage point, which is
broadly consistent with the size of our downward revision to foreign growth (see the box
“The Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty on Global Growth”). Consistent with our
standard practice, we are assuming no further increases in tariffs and, with negotiations
resuming in October between China and the United States, this outcome may even come
true. However, a further escalation of trade tensions is quite plausible, as we explore in
k
o
o our “Escalation of Trade Tensions” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty
l
t
u section.
O
&
l
e The United Kingdom continues to struggle with Brexit. The political
v
e
D developments of the past few weeks have made it clear that no consensus around a Brexit
n
o
c deal is likely to emerge any time in the next few months. Therefore, the assumption in
E
’ l our previous forecasts that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union (EU) with
t
n
I a deal in place by the end of the year is no longer tenable. Instead, we assume that there
will be another extension and that it will take an additional year to reach consensus on a
Brexit deal. Meanwhile, the continued uncertainty will weigh on the U.K. economy, with
some adverse spillovers to the euro area but a more limited effect on the rest of the world.
However, a no-deal Brexit by the October 31 deadline could still happen. As discussed
in our alternative scenario “No-Deal Brexit,” given the substantial preparation for this
possible outcome and markets having internalized some likelihood of such an event, there
will likely not be large disruptions to global financial markets. As such, a no-deal Brexit
would probably push foreign growth only slightly below our new baseline. That said, we
cannot rule out more severe and disruptive outcomes.
Foreign inflation stepped up in the second quarter, broadly in line with
expectations, due to earlier increases in oil prices and, in some key EMEs, food prices.
Incoming data show little sign of underlying inflationary pressures, however, with 12-
month core inflation in July for the euro area and Japan remaining subdued—at
0.9 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively—and oil prices falling. Against the backdrop of
subdued inflation and faltering growth, we expect the European Central Bank (ECB) will
soon announce further stimulus. AFE policy rates, more generally, are set to remain low
for long, and we have revised down the policy rate path for Canada a bit on the weaker

outlook. There was a plethora of policy rate cuts in EMEs, including Brazil, Chile, India,
Indonesia, Russia, Mexico, Thailand, and the Philippines, with central banks citing weak
domestic activity, concerns about global growth, and trade uncertainty.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• United Kingdom. Real GDP contracted 0.8 percent in the second quarter, held back
by the reversal of the stockpiling ahead of the original Brexit deadline, temporary
shutdowns by several car producers, and a sharp decline in investment. This reading
is 0.6 percentage point lower than our July Tealbook estimate and, with PMI data
through August also coming in surprisingly weak, we have revised down our k
o
o
projection for growth in the current quarter to only 0.4 percent. l
t
u
O
&
Given the recent approval of a bill by the House of Commons that intends to block an
l
e
v
exit from the EU without a deal, as well as the failed attempt by Prime Minister e
D
Johnson to consolidate his power by calling elections for October 15, we are n
o
c
moderately comfortable that the United Kingdom will not crash out of the EU by the E
l
’
October 31 deadline. That said, the political turbulence of recent weeks convinces us n t
I
that we can no longer assume that the United Kingdom will leave the EU with a deal
in place by year-end. Instead, we assume that the United Kingdom will take an
additional year to come up with an orderly way to execute Brexit as approved by the
EU. With elevated Brexit-related uncertainty persisting for much longer, we marked
down growth 0.6 percentage point for 2020 to 1 percent. That said, as Prime Minister
Johnson plans to repeat his call for a snap election for October, the risk of a no-deal
Brexit on October 31 remains, though it is somewhat diminished. Acknowledging the
huge uncertainty around this possibility, we see a no-deal Brexit as depressing U.K.
growth a further 0.7 percentage point to near zero next year, while euro-area growth
is lowered 0.3 percentage point to about 1 percent. (See the scenario “No-Deal
Brexit” in the Risks and Uncertainty section for details.)
• Euro Area. GDP growth slowed from 1.7 percent in the first quarter to a below-
potential pace of 0.8 percent in the second, mainly reflecting a slump in net exports
and ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector. The slowdown was especially
marked in Germany, with output contracting 0.3 percent at an annual rate. Economic
indicators, such as July retail sales as well as PMIs and economic sentiment through
August, suggest that euro-area growth will remain at 0.8 percent in the third quarter, a
touch weaker than our July Tealbook forecast. Going forward, we expect growth to

The Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty on Global Economic Activity
The outlook for trade remains highly uncertain. Figure 1 shows the staff’s index of trade policy uncertainty
(TPU), which is constructed by counting the frequency of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty
terms in major newspapers. The TPU index, which had fallen in July, rose again in August amid renewed trade
tensions between the United States and China, which included the announcement of additional tariffs, the
designation of China as a “currency manipulator,” and mutual threats of further tariff hikes. The August
increase marks the third wave of pronounced increases in TPU in recent years, following a first wave of
increases in early 2018—when initial tariffs were announced and then imposed on steel, aluminum, and some
imports from China—and a second wave of increases in May and June of this year, when additional tariffs were
imposed on China and threatened on Mexico.
While it is possible that trade negotiations will eventually lead to a more open and fair global competitive
k
o landscape, heightened uncertainty about trade policies is likely weighing on economic activity in the United
o
l States and around the world through a variety of channels.1 In particular, higher uncertainty may delay or
t
u
deter firms’ investment and hiring, lower consumer confidence and spending, and depress investors’
O
& sentiment while boosting flight-to-safety flows that appreciate the dollar, thus reducing U.S. net exports.
l
e
v To quantify the economic effects of increased trade tensions, we estimate a monthly vector auto-regression
e
D
(VAR) model that includes the staff’s index of TPU; manufacturing industrial production in the United States, in
n
o the AFEs, and in the EMEs; the broad real dollar index; world imports; U.S. stock prices; U.S. credit spreads; and
c
E U.S. import tariffs.2 The inclusion of tariffs in the VAR model allows us to isolate movements in TPU that reflect
l
t ’ variation in genuine trade uncertainty from those that reflect implemented trade policy actions.3
n
I
According to the VAR estimates, an increase in TPU lowers industrial production in the United States and
abroad, boosts the dollar, reduces the price of risky assets, and lowers world imports. These effects build over
time—the maximum decline in industrial production occurs after six months—and die out slowly. We convert
the effects on industrial production into GDP effects using the historical elasticity of GDP growth to industrial
production growth.
Our estimates imply that the three waves of trade tensions combined should subtract about 1 percent from the
level of GDP in both the United States and the foreign economies by early 2020 (the black lines in figure 2). The
first wave of increased uncertainty (red lines) accounts for the largest effects and is estimated to have
subtracted about 0.7 percent from the level of GDP. Had trade tensions not escalated further in May and again
more recently, the drag on GDP would have started to ease in the second half of 2019. In particular, the second
wave that started in May (blue lines) has exerted an additional drag on the level of global GDP of about
0.2 percent, while the third wave since August 2019 should subtract an additional 0.1 percent.

2 Our sample runs from 1985:M1 through 2019:M6. The VAR model, estimation details, and estimated impulse
responses are described in Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea Prestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2019),
“Does Trade Policy Uncertainty Affect Global Economic Activity?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, September 4), https://doi.org/10.17016/2573-2129.47. The VAR results are similar when we truncate
the estimation sample for the VAR in 2015, thus excluding the spikes in trade uncertainty in the last part of the sample.
3 Like many news-based uncertainty indicators, our measure of trade uncertainty may also capture news about future
changes in tariffs regardless of whether they are realized or not.

This analysis represents an attempt to quantify the all-in effects of increased TPU on global economic activity.
Our empirical model predicts material effects of trade tensions that will only begin to ease in the second half of
2020. That said, the confidence intervals around these estimates point to some degree of uncertainty,
especially given the lack of historical experience with increases in TPU of the magnitude that we have seen
recently. For the United States, the estimated adverse effects are somewhat larger than the drag we have
built into the Tealbook baseline and so represent a downside risk to that baseline projection. For foreign
economies, the estimated adverse effects are more in line with the downward revisions to our forecast since
last year, hinting that trade tensions may keep weighing on the outlook going forward.

gradually rise amid highly accommodative monetary policy, reaching 1.8 percent by
the first half of 2021, and hover around this pace through 2022. The outlook for next
year is down a bit, as we now expect Brexit uncertainty to persist for longer, causing
adverse spillovers to the euro area.
Headline 12-month inflation edged down from 1.3 percent in May to 1 percent in July
and August. With core inflation at just 0.9 percent, we have inflation remaining
subdued in the second half of this year before rising gradually to 1.6 percent at the
end of the forecast period. In light of the weak outlook for inflation and growth, we
expect the ECB to cut its deposit rate 20 basis points to negative 60 basis points at its
k
o September 12 meeting and restart its asset purchase program in October, as we
o
t l assumed in July.
u
O
&
l • Japan. GDP growth was puzzlingly strong in the first half of this year, given
e
v
e declines in industrial production and exports. After expanding at an annual rate of
D
n
2.8 percent in the first quarter, real GDP increased 1.8 percent in the second as a
o
c
E
sharp pickup in domestic demand offset the drag from net exports. That said,
l
’
t
n consumer confidence declined further in July, and the manufacturing PMI remained
I
in contractionary territory in August, leaving us more pessimistic about future
growth. Smoothing through the volatility induced by the scheduled October
consumption tax hike, we see growth declining to about zero in the second half of the
year. Over the next two years, we expect growth to be slightly above its potential
pace of 0.7 percent, supported by additional spending related to the 2020 Tokyo
Olympics and very accommodative monetary policy.
Both total and core 12-month inflation remained subdued in July at 0.6 percent and
0.4 percent, respectively. The upcoming consumption tax hike will provide only a
modest temporary boost to inflation, as its effect will be largely offset by stimulative
fiscal policies that will cut costs for households, including free public early childhood
education and higher education support. We expect total inflation to rise to about
1 percent by 2021. With inflation still well below the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ)
2 percent inflation target, we anticipate that the BOJ will keep its deposit rate at
negative 0.1 percent through 2021. The BOJ continued its purchases of Japanese
government bonds but reduced the purchase size in the 5- to 10-year tenures, as the
10-year sovereign yield fell below the lower end of its targeted range of negative
0.2 percent to positive 0.2 percent. The BOJ also announced that it will further cut
purchase amounts in this sector in September.

• Canada. Real GDP growth picked up from a meager 0.5 percent in the first quarter
to 3.7 percent in the second, 1.1 percentage points higher than in the July Tealbook,
reflecting rebounds in oil production and exports. That said, weak investment in the
second quarter and subdued manufacturing PMIs through August point to a step-
down in growth to 1.2 percent this quarter. We expect growth to edge up to its
potential pace of 1.7 percent by the second half of 2020 and remain about there over
the forecast period. The projection for 2020 is a bit lower than in the July Tealbook,
reflecting lower oil prices and the weaker U.S. outlook. We expect the weakness
over the next several quarters to lead the Bank of Canada to cut its policy rate
25 basis points early next year to 1.5 percent.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES u t

• China. After slowing sharply to 5.6 percent in the second quarter, we expect similar e
v
e
growth in the current quarter. Industrial production contracted and retail sales growth D
n
o
slowed in July. Much of this weakness was anticipated and reflected a slowing of
c
E
auto sales and production following a surge in June ahead of a tightening of auto ’ l
t
n
emissions standards. In contrast, July exports held up relatively well, as a rebound in I
sales to Asia and the EU more than offset falling exports to the United States. All
told, we have revised down the outlook a touch for the second half, but growth this
year should still come in within the Chinese authorities’ target range of 6 to
6½ percent.
We expect the recently implemented 15 percentage point tariff hike on about
$100 billion of Chinese goods (together with China’s retaliation on about $30 billion
of U.S. goods), the uncertainty effects of the recent increase in trade tensions, and
some offsetting further policy stimulus to take about 0.1 percentage point, on net, off
China’s growth over the forecast period. With this small downward revision, we see
growth holding steady at about 5.7 percent through the end of the forecast period.
• Other Emerging Asia. India’s GDP growth stepped down to an unexpectedly low
2.7 percent last quarter, as manufacturing activity contracted. This step-down,
together with a contraction of output in Hong Kong driven by a collapse in
investment, pushed down overall growth in the region to 2.5 percent in the second
quarter, 0.3 percentage point below our July Tealbook estimate. We now expect real
GDP growth to rise to only 2.7 percent in the current quarter, 0.5 percentage point
below our July forecast. The markdown, in large part, is due to substantial downward
Page 47 of 136

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) September 6, 2019
revision to Hong Kong’s near-term outlook as a consequence of political unrest,
which is weighing especially hard on tourism and retail sales. These disruptions
should abate following the announcement by Hong Kong’s government that it will
formally withdraw the extradition bill, but the situation remains quite uncertain.
Elsewhere in the region, incoming data continue to point to a recovery in the second
half of the year. Exports bounced back in July after a very weak end to the second
quarter, and industrial production grew strongly in July in Taiwan, Korea, and
Singapore. Recovery in manufacturing, together with support from fiscal policy in
some countries, should boost growth in the region to its potential pace of 3.5 percent
by the beginning of next year.
k
o
o
t l • Mexico. Real GDP stagnated in the second quarter following a 1 percent drop in the
u
O
& first, weighed down by weak domestic demand, particularly investment. However,
l
e with relatively strong manufacturing exports, together with a projected pickup in U.S.
v
e
D manufacturing, growth should recover somewhat in the second half of the year, albeit
n
o
to a still lackluster 1.5 percent. Inflation has moved down in recent months to
c
E
’ l 3.8 percent on a 12-month basis, below the 4 percent upper limit of the tolerance
t
n
I range, reflecting lower energy prices. Amid lessened inflationary pressures and
responding to the weak economy, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) lowered its policy rate
25 basis points to 8 percent in mid-August—its first cut in five years. With the BOM
easing monetary policy, we expect growth to move up gradually to a trend-like pace
of 2.5 percent by 2021. However, the downbeat tone of the incoming data,
particularly in investment, prompted us to lower our path for growth over the forecast
period about 0.2 percentage point.
• Brazil. Real GDP grew 1.8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter after
contracting in the first quarter, printing well above our July Tealbook estimate. The
surge was led by investment, but growth was also boosted by the dissipation of the
drag from temporary factors, including the Brumadinho dam collapse. The central
bank of Brazil surprised markets with a 50 basis point cut in interest rates, and, with
inflation running below target at just over 3 percent, we expect further monetary
easing. In addition, progress on the long-awaited pension reform, which is expected
to be approved in October, should improve business confidence. All told, we expect
growth to pick up to 2.3 percent next year and to 2.8 percent in 2021. If this forecast
materializes, it will mean that, after several years of faltering recovery, Brazil will
finally climb out of the deepest recession in its history.

• Argentina. Financial turmoil again intensified in Argentina, this time triggered by
President Macri’s resounding defeat in the August 11 primaries. The result makes it
highly likely that opposition challenger Alberto Fernández (no relation to Fernández’s
running mate, former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) will win in the
October 27 presidential election. Concerns about the policies of a potential
Fernández administration fueled a currency crash and rendered the government
unable to roll over its short-term debt. As a result, on August 28, the Macri
government announced that it would unilaterally extend the maturities of Treasury
bills and seek a voluntary “reprofiling” of about $100 billion in longer-term public
debt, about half of which is owed to the IMF under Argentina’s Stand-By
k
o
Arrangement. These announcements only intensified downward pressures on the o
l
t
u
currency, prompting the Macri government to impose capital controls on

Financial Market Developments
Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were driven by an
escalation in international trade tensions, growing concerns about the global growth
outlook, and the prospect of more policy accommodation by central banks.1 Nominal
Treasury yields posted very large declines, with the 30-year yield reaching historical lows
at one point. The declines in Treasury yields were likely due in part to typical flight-to-
safety demands triggered by the uptick in concerns about the domestic economic outlook.
In addition, global demands for safe U.S. assets may have increased markedly over the
period, perhaps due in part to somewhat greater concerns about the foreign outlook than
the domestic outlook and to the increasing share of sovereign debt with very low and
negative yields in AFEs. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate shifted down
notably, showing particular sensitivity to trade-related news. A straight read of options
quotes suggests that market participants see a 25 basis point reduction in the target range
as the most likely outcome at the September FOMC meeting. Broad equity price indexes
were down as much as 6 percent in early August but are down only about 1.5 percent, on
net, over the intermeeting period as a whole. Corporate bond spreads widened modestly.
 Nominal Treasury yields fell 28, 47, and 53 basis points, respectively, at the
2-, 10-, and 30-year maturities. The spread between 2- and 10-year tenors
s
turned negative in mid-August for the first time since 2007 and has since t
e
k
remained near zero. a r
M
l
a
 Measures of the expected level of the federal funds rate at the end of this year ci
n
a
and beyond moved down. A straight read of OIS forward rates suggests that n
Fi
investors expect the federal funds rate to decline about 60 basis points by the
end of this year, while a model that adjusts for term premiums implies a
decline of about 35 basis points.
1 The analysis in this section reflects market data through close of business on September 5. On
the morning of September 6, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published the August Employment Situation
report. In the report, payrolls growth was slightly below expectations, the unemployment rate was in line
with expectations, and hourly earnings and labor force participation printed above expectations. Nominal
Treasury yields were down 3 basis points at both the 2- and 10-year maturities in the first 10 minutes of
trading subsequent to the release. Equity index futures were little changed on net.

 Inflation compensation declined 24 basis points and 17 basis points, on net,
for the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year horizons, to 1.41 percent and 1.64 percent,
respectively.
 Broad equity price indexes decreased by about 1.5 percent, on net, and option-
implied volatility for the S&P 500 index—the VIX—increased about
2 percentage points. Investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond spreads
widened by 13 basis points and 22 basis points, respectively.
 Global equity indexes generally declined, the exchange value of the dollar
increased, and AFE sovereign yields fell notably.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
Nominal U.S. Treasury yields decreased markedly across the curve, on net, over
the intermeeting period, with the yields on 2-, 10- and 30-year Treasury securities
dropping 28, 47, and 53 basis points, respectively. These moves are quite significant,
with the decline in the 10-year yield falling within the 6th percentile of intermeeting
changes since 1994, while the decline in the 30-year yield is the largest since 2008 and
the third largest since 1994.
While it is difficult to fully account for the magnitudes of these yield movements,
market participants cited several factors that may help explain the recent declines in s
t
e
longer-term yields. These factors included the escalation in trade tensions between the k

balance, had only modest effects on financial markets. Staff models attribute about half
of the declines in nominal longer-term Treasury yields to lower term premiums, with an
estimate of the 10-year term premium currently standing near its lowest historical level at
around negative 71 basis points. (The box “Drivers of Recent Movements in Treasury
Yields” provides additional analysis on these yield movements.)
Expectations of near- and medium-term domestic monetary policy shifted down
over the period and were particularly sensitive to news about U.S.–China trade tensions.
Overall, FOMC communications had only modest effects on policy expectations. The
July FOMC statement and press conference were seen as slightly less accommodative

Drivers of Recent Movements in Treasury Yields
Yields on nominal Treasury securities have declined dramatically, on net, across the curve since the
July FOMC meeting. Our analysis suggests that the decline in short‐term Treasury yields largely
reflected heightened trade tensions between the United States and China that lowered investors’
expectations for the near‐term path of monetary policy. The declines in longer‐term yields are not
as closely linked to trade‐related news. Instead, a larger share of the fall in long‐term yields
appears to be related to investors’ concern about the downside risks to the foreign outlook. In
addition, investor demand for long‐term U.S. Treasury securities reportedly increased as the share
of sovereign debt with negative yields has risen.
Yields on short‐term U.S. Treasury securities responded to escalating trade tensions between the
United States and China. As shown by the red dots in the lower‐left quadrant of figure 1, declines in
two‐year Treasury yields immediately after adverse news on U.S.–China trade tensions were large.
On net, taking into account negative and positive trade news that occurred in either daytime or
after‐hours trading, the change in the two‐year Treasury yield in narrow windows after these
announcements explains 18 basis points of the 28 basis point intermeeting decline (see figure 2). In
addition, staff term structure models ascribe a majority of the decline of short‐term Treasury yields
over the period to declines in the expected path of short‐terms rates. Taken together, these
results suggest that investors expect monetary policy to respond to the perceived drag on growth
related to the U.S.–China trade tensions.
In contrast, the immediate response of longer‐term yields to both negative and positive news
about trade developments account, on net, for only 10 basis points of the total 53 basis point

decline in 30‐year Treasury yields (see figure 2).1 However, we can attribute 18 basis points of the
decline to negative news emanating from abroad (which includes foreign economic data releases
and some after‐hours news related to U.S.–China trade tensions) (see figure 3).2 This inference
relies on the assumption that most of the news about foreign economic developments occurred
after domestic trading hours. In stark contrast, overnight moves in the two‐year Treasury yield
were, on balance, slightly positive. These findings suggest that concerns about downside risks to
the foreign growth outlook had a greater effect on long‐term yields than short‐term yields.
Long‐term U.S. Treasury yields were likely also depressed by increasing demand for positive‐
yielding long‐dated U.S. Treasury securities from investors globally. Over the intermeeting period,
the share of euro‐area sovereign debt with a negative yield and maturity greater than 10 years
increased 17 percentage points and accounts for about 40 percent of the total outstanding
sovereign debt with maturities greater than 10 years (not shown). Similarly, the duration of the
global stock of debt with negative yields has moved up from 5.2 years to 6.3 years over the same
period, the largest intermeeting increase in duration in the past few years (see figure 4).
Anecdotal reports support the reach‐for‐yield factor behind falling long‐term yields. The demand
for positive‐yielding long‐dated U.S. Treasury securities, notably from pensions and insurers, was
reportedly very strong. In addition, foreign investors were reportedly increasingly willing to add such
exposure without hedging the FX risk, while U.S. pensions were influenced by a mid‐September
deadline that allowed them to mitigate tax liabilities associated with portfolio rebalancing.3

1 Intermeeting negative trade‐related news was associated with gross declines in the 30‐year yield of roughly
27 basis points, based on the immediate response of yields, but positive news on trade that emerged mainly during

than expected, but subsequent communications—including the Chair’s Jackson Hole
remarks—were seen as pointing to a slightly more accommodative outlook on the
margin.
A straight read of the option-implied probability distribution of the federal funds
rate suggests that the odds investors attach to a 25 basis point or larger reduction in the
target range of the federal funds rate at the September meeting increased to around
85 percent, while the odds attached to the target range remaining unchanged fell to about
15 percent. In addition, market-implied policy expectations by year-end and beyond
moved down notably since the previous FOMC meeting. A straight read of OIS forward
rates suggests that investors expect the federal funds rate to decline about 60 basis points
by year-end, to a level 25 basis points lower than was expected at the time of the July
FOMC meeting, and roughly an additional 55 basis points by the end of 2020. However,
a staff model that adjusts for term premiums implies only about a 35 basis point decline
in the federal funds rate by year-end 2019 and, approximately, an additional 10 basis
point decline in 2020.
The near-term forward spread on Treasury securities—defined as the difference
between the six-quarter-ahead forward rate and the three-month Treasury bill yield—has
moved down further since the July FOMC meeting and, at one point, reached its lowest
level since the beginning of 2008. The 10-year to 3-month Treasury spread also slipped
deeper into negative territory and has now been negative or near zero since the end of s
t
e

a touch over the intermeeting period. These probabilities now stand at roughly 40 to
50 percent, levels that are substantially lower than what is implied by models using term
spreads alone.
Uncertainty about short- and long-term rates implied by swaptions increased, with
the implied volatility on the 10-year swap rate remaining near levels not seen since
February 2018. Despite the notable increase in volatility and associated reduction in
Treasury market depth, trading conditions were described as orderly, and liquidity was
noted as less of a factor compared with the period of heightened market volatility in late
2018.

Since the July FOMC meeting, 5-year and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based inflation
compensation declined notably, by 24 basis points and 17 basis points, on net, to
1.41 percent and 1.64 percent, respectively, reaching their lowest levels since the end of
last year. The staff’s term structure models suggest that about half of the decline in
inflation compensation is explained by a decrease in the inflation risk premium. Surveys
generally continue to point to stable longer-term inflation expectations.
Broad stock price indexes decreased about 1.5 percent, on net, over the
intermeeting period amid heightened volatility. The escalation of trade tensions between
China and the United States weighed on equity prices, as stock prices of high-China-
exposure firms notably underperformed the broader market. Consistent with the sizable
decline in yields and the inversion of the yield curve, bank equity prices also
underperformed, and bank earnings forecasts for the next few quarters were revised
down. Conversely, the stock prices of utilities and real estate firms increased, reportedly
benefiting from demand by investors reaching for less cyclical and higher-yielding assets.
The VIX increased 2 percentage points, on net, but remained well below the high levels
reached in December 2018.
Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds decreased notably,
reaching historical lows at one point. Spreads on corporate bonds over comparable-

domestically and abroad, as well as some reassuring second-quarter corporate earnings
and retail-sector data, may have partially supported corporate asset prices. Another
possibility is that, while increased uncertainty about the U.S. outlook weighed on both
domestic corporate assets and Treasury securities, the global demand for safe U.S. assets
may have been boosted by even greater investor concerns about the foreign outlook and
by the reach-for-yield behavior stemming from very low or negative yields abroad.

price moves in foreign financial markets. On balance, foreign equity indexes fell, the
dollar and other safe-haven currencies appreciated, and AFE sovereign yields declined
notably, in part as central bank communications abroad remained quite accommodative.
On balance, the broad dollar index rose about 1.79 percent over the intermeeting
period as investor demand for safe assets led to large outflows from dedicated emerging
market funds and declines in emerging market currencies. The dollar initially moved
higher amid the strong risk-off market reaction following the August 1 announcement by
the U.S. Administration of additional tariffs on Chinese goods. The dollar continued its
rise over the next week as the People’s Bank of China allowed the renminbi to depreciate
through the psychologically important threshold of 7 CNY/USD, which prompted the
U.S. Administration to label China a “currency manipulator.”2 Later in the period, the
announcement by Chinese authorities of additional tariffs on U.S. goods and retaliatory
measures by the U.S. Administration renewed pressure on the renminbi, which fell by
almost 4 percent to 7.15 CNY/USD, its lowest level since 2008. The dollar also
strengthened notably against Latin American currencies, including about 3.5 percent
against the Mexican peso, 8.5 percent against the Brazilian real, and 27.5 percent against
the Argentine peso. The Argentine peso depreciated sharply and Argentine sovereign
yields soared following the defeat of the current pro-market president in Argentina’s
presidential election primary and subsequent announcement of plans for a debt
restructuring and the imposition of capital controls.

the period.

abroad led to significant declines in AFE yields, which reached record low levels in

Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom before moving higher toward the end of the
period. Market-based policy expectations moved lower, with notable declines in Canada
and the euro area. Remarks by ECB official Olli Rehn in mid-August noting a need for
significant monetary stimulus in the euro area pushed the implied two-year-ahead policy
rate in the euro area to a new low of negative 0.76 percent. Weaker-than-expected
industrial production and business sentiment data in Germany contributed to the decline
in longer-term euro-area yields. On balance, the German 10-year yield fell 20 basis
points to negative 0.59 percent. The Italian 10-year yield also reached a record low of
0.95 percent as a new coalition government was formed, thus avoiding the need for new
elections. Amid evolving Brexit-related headlines, the 10-year U.K. yield was volatile,
initially falling to a record low of 0.41 percent, but is little changed on net. Staff models
suggest around half of the decline in long-term AFE yields was in the term premium
component, implying that both expectations of lower future short rates and uncertainty
about future growth contributed materially to the declines.
The risk-off sentiment weighed on foreign equity prices over most of the period.
However, foreign equity indexes were supported both by expectations for more monetary
and fiscal stimulus in the euro area and China and by political developments in the
United Kingdom and Italy late in the period that were viewed as reducing near-term risks.
On balance, foreign equity indexes are slightly lower, and banks and automobile
manufacturers declined notably. Equity markets in Hong Kong underperformed amid

ongoing protests, but some of the losses retraced as political tensions abated somewhat. t

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Despite the volatility in many domestic and global financial markets over the

The EFFR averaged 2.13 percent, with its spread to IOER down a bit relative to the
previous intermeeting period.
Assets under management of government and prime MMFs increased about
3 percent over the intermeeting period, extending a trend seen since before the previous
FOMC meeting. These inflows were reportedly due in part to the increased attractiveness
of MMFs amid the flattening of the yield curve, although the deterioration in risk

sentiment may also have contributed. MMF inflows helped offset some of the upward
pressure on money market rates coming from increased Treasury bill issuance following
the resolution of the debt ceiling. On net, overnight secured spreads to IOER narrowed
somewhat, while spreads to OIS for Treasury bills and for unsecured private instruments
at tenors of a month or more widened. Take-up at the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP
operations averaged about $6 billion during the intermeeting period.3
As a result of the July FOMC decision to cease balance sheet runoff, the Federal
Reserve will purchase an additional $68 billion in Treasury securities—including
Treasury bills—through the end of the year. Most of these purchases, which began in
August, will be conducted in the secondary market. This is the first time Treasury
purchases have been conducted in the secondary market since 2014.

3 On August 22, 2019, the Federal Reserve conducted the second and last TDF test operation for
2019. The Fed offered seven-day term deposits at a rate of 1 basis point over IOER. The take-up and
participation were in line with that seen in recent similarly parameterized tests; take-up totaled $1.7 billion,
with 18 banks participating and five max bids.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for businesses and households appear to have been little
affected by recent turbulence in financial markets. As such, financing conditions remain
generally supportive of spending and economic activity.
• Corporate bond issuance was solid in August, driven by resilient
investment-grade issuance, while speculative-grade issuance was somewhat
weaker than average. Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on
banks’ books picked up in July and August.
• Mortgage rates declined roughly 30 basis points, and originations have moved
up in recent months for both purchases and refinancing.
• Consumer credit conditions continued to be generally supportive of spending.
Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter, and
consumer loan growth at banks remained robust in July and August.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Businesses
The market volatility over the intermeeting period has, so far, left little imprint on
financing conditions for corporations. In particular, while spreads on corporate bonds
relative to comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened over the intermeeting period,
yields on corporate bonds decreased notably, reaching historical lows.
Against this backdrop, overall issuance of corporate bonds was solid in August,
driven by resilient investment-grade issuance. While speculative-grade corporate bond
issuance was somewhat subdued in August, it was comparable to that seen over the same
period in 2018. Corporate bond issuance exhibited the usual slowdown in late August;
however, investors reportedly expect issuance to pick up in September.
Preliminary data suggest that institutional leveraged loan issuance in August was
moderate, partly due to seasonal patterns, with a small number of riskier leveraged loan
s
n
offerings reportedly withdrawn amid greater investor scrutiny. July issuance was o
ti

somewhat larger and exceeded the average monthly pace for the first half of 2019, as n

banks. Interest rates on fixed-rate nonsyndicated C&I loans declined in July, while
interest rates on floating-rate loans remained little changed from their June levels.
Public equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings slowed in July
but remained roughly in line with July issuance levels over the past few years. Amid
increased market volatility, there were no initial public equity offerings by domestic
firms in August; however, several deals are reportedly expected to be completed over the
next few months.
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations weakened slightly over
the intermeeting period. In particular, the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond
downgrades modestly outpaced that of upgrades in July and August. The six-month
trailing nonfinancial bond default rate edged down, while the KMV expected year-ahead
default rate ticked up; both measures currently stand at roughly the midpoints of their
historical distributions. Expectations of year-ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms
were revised down in July and August, although by much less than the sharp downgrades
around the turn of the year. Analyst estimates for long-term earnings growth have
continued to decline and are currently slightly below their median since 2000.
Small Businesses
Available data suggest that the supply of credit to small businesses remained
accommodative, while demand continued to be somewhat weak. Small business loan
originations—as measured by the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending
Index—ticked down in June but remained approximately 2 percent higher than their year-
ago level. In the August National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey, the
net percent of respondents reporting that it was harder to obtain credit now compared
with three months ago inched down further to near its post-crisis low. At the same time,
the demand for credit by small businesses appears to have remained muted, with over
half of small business owners in the August NFIB poll continuing to report that they were
not interested in a loan. Recent indicators of small business loan performance have also
been strong, as delinquencies have stayed low relative to historical levels.

The volume of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance
was slightly weaker in July and August than the same period last year, though industry
analysts reportedly anticipate that issuance will pick up in September in response to
recent declines in interest rates.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions for state and local governments in municipal bond markets
remained accommodative on balance. Gross issuance of municipal bonds was solid in
July and robust in August, with new capital raising accounting for the majority of the
issuance. Municipal bond yields in both the primary and secondary markets declined
notably over the intermeeting period but less so than the yields on comparable-maturity
Treasury securities, leaving yield ratios notably higher.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased over the
intermeeting period. Residential mortgage rates declined but less than long-term
Treasury yields, as the increase in prepayment risk and the rise in implied interest rate
volatility reportedly reduced the appeal of mortgage-backed securities. Since their recent
peak last November, mortgage rates have fallen about 150 basis points and now stand
near their lowest level since mid-2016. Home-purchase originations moved up to near
their solid 2017 levels. Refinancing originations rose in July, although they remained
fairly low compared with the refinancing wave seen in 2011 and 2012, when a larger
share of borrowers had more to gain from refinancing. Staff analysis suggests that
refinancing volumes are not likely to rise much further given the expected path of
mortgage rates, as the share of borrowers who potentially stand to benefit from
refinancing remains low. Mortgage credit standards—as measured by staff estimates of
lenders’ maximum available debt-to-income ratios—have been stable since late 2018
and, after several years of easing, appear to have settled at somewhat tighter levels than
in the early 2000s. n s

second quarter overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through July
and August. The moderate pace of overall consumer credit growth in the second quarter
may reflect, in part, a restraint on demand brought about by increases in the past couple
of years in consumer interest rates. However, interest rates on existing credit card
balances leveled off in the second quarter and are expected to fall in August with the
recent decline in the prime rate. In addition, since the beginning of the year, auto loan
interest rates have decreased on net. In consumer ABS markets, issuance was solid, and
spreads remained at relatively low levels, though somewhat above their post-crisis
averages.
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS INDEXES
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial
corporations indicates that financing conditions have tightened modestly over the
intermeeting period but remain accommodative relative to historical standards. The
tightening in the index is consistent with the decline in equity prices and the widening of
corporate bond spreads over the same period. As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook
section, other publicly available financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set
of financial variables into a summary series, also pointed to either roughly unchanged or
modestly tighter financial conditions. Overall, these indexes indicate that broad financial
conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical
standards.

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations, measures financing
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1 This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade. To the extent
that speculative-grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment-grade
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.
The second index in the table measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending
Practices. Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on
their balance sheets.2
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary
series using various statistical methods. While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial
market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both changes in financing conditions
and other shocks to the economy.
1 This index was first discussed in the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” in the Financing Conditions for
Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.
2 This index is an updated version of the index developed in William F. Bassett, Mary Beth Chosak,
John C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,”
Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 62 (March), pp. 23–40. The current index uses a new weighting approach for
each loan category.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
&
s
k
In our assessment, the risks around our baseline projection for GDP are tilted to the s
Ri
downside, both over the next year and further out, and we see a corresponding upward skew for
the unemployment rate. Among the most salient risks, trade policies and foreign economic
developments seem more likely to move in directions that would create a significant drag on
domestic activity than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, the softness in
business investment and manufacturing production so far this year could be pointing to a much
more substantial slowing in economic growth than we currently recognize. Of course, there are
risks to the upside as well. Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and
business investment remain solid—bolstered, in part, by the 2017 tax cuts—and financial
conditions, despite recent volatility, remain favorable. In these circumstances, spending could
expand at a pace that is faster than in the staff projection. Although we view the current
circumstances as quite uncertain, we judge the overall degree of uncertainty as being broadly in
line with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC) because that
period includes the most recent two recessions along with a number of other episodes with
elevated uncertainty and market volatility.
Recession risks have likely increased. As shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment
of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit, the estimated probability of moving into recession over
the next year based on a term-spread model has moved up further to 66 percent. This estimate
should be interpreted with some caution given the long sample period over which the model is
estimated and secular trends—particularly declining term premiums—that may materially affect
its predictions. The recession probability estimate from a model-averaging framework that uses
a selection of both real and financial variables is 45 percent. This figure is above the
unconditional recession probability of 23 percent and has also moved up since the July Tealbook,
mainly because of the decline in the term spread and the increase in the VIX.1
As indicated in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the estimated
probability of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) over the next three years has moved
1 The probability from the model-averaging framework (MAF) is likely also boosted because of the same
factors affecting the term-spread model, although to a smaller extent because the MAF model also considers
other factors.

economic outcomes. Similarly, the estimated distributions in the exhibit “Conditional U
&
Distributions of Macroeconomic Variables 2 Years Ahead” have become increasingly skewed to s
k
s
the downside since last year, with the probability of very high unemployment rates two years Ri
from now reaching levels previously attained only just prior to the onset of a recession. In
contrast, as shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year Ahead,” four-
quarter-ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the unemployment rate, based
on historical staff forecast errors, are not unusually wide or skewed. One reason the estimates in
these two exhibits differ may be that the asymmetries associated with recessions are more
prominent at longer horizons, as the consequences of adverse shocks accumulate.
With regard to inflation, we view the risks to the inflation projection as slanted to the
downside—in part because of the downside risks to economic activity. Moreover, inflation has
been running low this year, and longer-run inflation expectations could currently be lower than
we recognize. Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more than expected and
put downward pressure on inflation. There are also risks to the upside. For example, an
extended period with unusually tight resource utilization could lead to greater upward pressure
on wages and prices, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects
of resource utilization on inflation. In addition, a widespread and sustained increase in trade
barriers could lead to temporarily higher inflation.
All of these inflation risks would tend to be of modest size as long as inflation
expectations remained reasonably well anchored. However, the risks could increase
substantially, in either direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down. Such
movements in expectations could induce changes in inflation to build on themselves and thus
lead inflation to deviate significantly and persistently from 2 percent. Notwithstanding all of
these concerns, the overall degree of uncertainty is probably about the same as over the past
20 years.

No-Deal Brexit [SIGMA model] r
e
c
n
U
Our current baseline assumes that negotiations between the United Kingdom and the
&
s
European Union will extend beyond the current deadline of October 31 and result in an orderly k
s
Ri
Brexit sometime in 2020. However, the political developments of the past few weeks point to
contentious negotiations ahead and a higher risk of a no-deal Brexit. In this scenario, we assume
that the United Kingdom rejects the current withdrawal proposal and leaves the European Union
on October 31 without a deal, creating a range of economic disruptions despite current efforts by
the authorities to prepare for such an event. Financial conditions in the United Kingdom and, to
a lesser extent, in the rest of Europe tighten, while household and business confidence
deteriorate. All told, the levels of U.K. and EU (excluding the United Kingdom) GDP decline
1.1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, by the end of 2021. Flight-to-safety flows into dollar-
denominated assets cause the dollar to appreciate 3 percent, and global equity prices decline
3 percent.
Weaker foreign activity, the stronger dollar, and some tightening of U.S. financial
conditions lead U.S. GDP growth to moderate to 1.6 percent in 2020, about 0.4 percentage point
below the baseline. The U.S. unemployment rate rises about 0.2 percentage point above the
baseline over the forecast period. Core PCE inflation runs at 1.6 percent in 2020, before
gradually increasing to 1.9 percent in 2024. The inertial Taylor rule with a parameter value of
1.0 on the output gap—which is a more responsive specification than in the baseline policy
rule—prescribes a path for the federal funds rate that is about 25 basis points below the
baseline.2
The relatively modest effect of a no-deal Brexit in this scenario, compared with other,
more pessimistic assessments of a no-deal Brexit being bandied about, is predicated on the
assumption that the safeguards that European governments and financial institutions have put in
place since the 2016 Brexit referendum are effective in containing most economic and financial
disruptions and that financial markets have by now discounted much of this event. However,
given the unprecedented nature of Brexit, more-adverse outcomes are entirely possible.
2 In addition, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in
all scenarios.

ai
Our current baseline assumes that the United States and its trading partners impose no r t
e
c
new tariffs, but existing tariffs—including those raised on September 1 on a sizable tranche of n
U
Chinese imports—remain in place. The United States, however, has threatened additional tariffs &
s
k
on Chinese imports that, absent successful negotiations, would be levied later this year, causing s
Ri
the average tariff rate on Chinese imports to rise from its current level of about 17 percent to
25 percent.3 While the current process of trade negotiations could ultimately lead to lower trade
barriers, we cannot exclude the possibility that trade tensions with China and other trading
partners escalate further, resulting in a sizable increase in trade barriers that would entail
profoundly adverse effects.
This scenario assumes that trade tensions between the United States and China escalate,
causing tariffs on all Chinese imports to increase to 33 percent by the end of 2019. In addition,
tariffs of 25 percent are imposed on $314 billion of imports from Mexico, and tariffs of
20 percent are levied on $160 billion of vehicle imports.4 In our scenario, Mexico and China
partially retaliate against the U.S. actions, while tariffs on vehicles trigger a fully proportional
response. Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S.
exports, these policies have little effect on the trade balance. However, the higher cost of
imported consumption goods depresses household spending, while business demand for
investment declines as a result of the higher cost of imported capital goods and lower expected
profits. In addition, the escalation of trade tensions leads to a widespread decline in global
sentiment, with corporate borrowing spreads widening and global equity prices falling about
20 percent.
These developments lead to a significant and protracted slowdown in U.S. growth. GDP
growth drops to 0.4 percent in the second half of 2019 and rises only to 1 percent in 2020,
1 percentage point below the baseline. Higher import prices boost total PCE inflation to
3.4 percent in the second half of this year before inflation slows down to 1.4 percent in 2020 as
3 The average tariff rate on Chinese imports was around 3 percent in 2017. The current average level of
17 percent is the result of an average tariff increase of 14 percentage points. This increase is computed by averaging
the 25 percent tariff rate on $230 billion of imports levied starting in 2018; the 15 percent tariff rate on $100 billion
of imports levied on September 1, 2019; and the 0 percent tariff rate on the remaining $175 billion of imports that
have not been tariffed to date. The additional measures that have been threatened include a further 5 percentage
point hike on the $230 billion of imports that are currently taxed at 25 percent and tariffs of 15 percent on the
remaining $175 billion of imports from China that have not been taxed so far.
4 Most of these tariffs would be levied on imports from the European Union, Japan, and South Korea.

Recession with Financial Amplification [FRB/US model] s
Ri
The softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year and
the recent inversions in the yield curve could be pointing to a substantial deterioration in
economic activity, and, as noted earlier, a number of statistical models indicate that the
probability of a recession over the next year is above average. Moreover, leverage in the
nonfinancial business sector is elevated. In this scenario, a recession is assumed to be amplified
by the high levels of business indebtedness, which lead firms to reduce hiring and investment by
more than they would if their debt were lower. We also assume that monetary policymakers
aggressively respond to the sharp and sustained increase in the unemployment rate consistent
with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.
Real GDP growth starts to decline later this year, and the unemployment rate rises. The
federal funds rate drops sharply but becomes constrained by the ELB in the third quarter of 2020,
thereby prolonging the downturn in the absence of unconventional monetary policy actions.
GDP only begins to recover in 2022, and the unemployment rate peaks at 6.8 percent, an
increase of 3.1 percentage points from the start of the recession.6 With substantial slack in
resource utilization, inflation falls to 1.5 percent in 2021.
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate [FRB/US model]
While there is substantial uncertainty around the empirical estimates of the long-run
equilibrium federal funds rate, most estimates suggest that it has declined in recent decades.
Long-term yields have been mostly below 3 percent in recent years, and their pronounced
declines since the beginning of the year raise the possibility that the long-run equilibrium rate
might be even lower than we are currently assuming. If this were the case, monetary policy
would currently be restrictive. In this scenario, we assume that the real long-run equilibrium rate
5 As in the previous scenario, the federal funds rate evolves following an inertial Taylor rule with a
coefficient of 1.0 on the output gap.
6 If the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates were not a constraint, the policy rate would fall to
negative 2¼ percent, which would shave ½ percentage point off the increase in the unemployment rate.
Alternatively, unconventional monetary policy actions could conceivably achieve that same amount of easing.

c
n Because of this gradual recognition, and because of inertia in the baseline policy rule, the
U
&
federal funds rate does not fall enough to fully offset the weaker aggregate demand implied by
s
k
s the lower real long-run equilibrium rate. As a result, output expands more slowly than in the
Ri
baseline, and the path for the unemployment rate is slightly higher. GDP growth through 2020
and 2021 is, on average, about ½ percentage point lower than in the baseline projection; the
unemployment rate is between ¼ and ½ percentage point higher from 2020 to 2025. With
resource utilization only slightly weaker, inflation remains close to the baseline.
In the longer run, monetary policy fully responds to the lower equilibrium rate. By 2025,
the federal funds rate is about 1 percentage point lower than in the baseline, allowing GDP
growth to recover to near its potential pace and helping keep the unemployment rate near its
longer-run value.7 Although the outcomes over the next few years are not particularly bad, the
fact that policymakers take a while to recognize the lower real long-run equilibrium rate may
represent a lost opportunity to sustain a very strong labor market for longer. In the long run,
once policymakers have recognized the situation, they will realize that they have substantially
less space to ease in case of an adverse shock.
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US model]
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment
remain solid, including strong labor market conditions and low interest rates. Indeed, consumer
spending is estimated to have increased at a strong pace through July. In this scenario, we
assume that consumer spending and, in turn, investment expand at a faster pace than in the
baseline. We also assume that these favorable conditions result in a larger cyclical response in
labor force participation than is typical, which attenuates somewhat the decline in the
unemployment rate.
Under these assumptions, GDP increases about 3 percent, on average, in 2019 and 2020,
and the unemployment rate declines to 2.9 percent by the end of 2021. Inflation increases
7 In the current and two remaining scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the baseline policy rule,
which assumes a coefficient of just 0.2 on the output gap.

While the staff revised down its estimate of the natural rate of unemployment this round, k
s
Ri
the updated estimate remains about 0.7 percentage point above the actual unemployment rate.
Despite that unemployment gap, wage gains by most measures have remained modest in recent
years, in line with the staff’s assessment of trend productivity growth and underlying inflation.
However, another way of reconciling modest wage growth with a very low unemployment rate is
that resource utilization may be less tight than assumed in the baseline. In this scenario, we
assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past several years and
continues to fall to 3.75 percent at the end of 2019, nearly ¾ percentage point lower than in the
baseline.8 We also assume that the trend labor force participation rate has been decreasing at a
slower pace for the past several years and continues to do so going forward. In addition,
structural productivity is assumed to grow ¼ percentage point faster than in the baseline in the
past several years and going forward.
We assume that households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential growth
and its implications for income and profits; thus, consumer spending and investment are
commensurately stronger. GDP growth is, on average, about 1 percentage point above the
baseline. The unemployment rate falls to 3.2 percent by 2024, around ¾ percentage point lower
than in the staff projection. Even so, given the lower natural rate of unemployment, resource
utilization is, on average, less tight than in the baseline. The path for inflation is slightly lower,
primarily reflecting the stronger productivity growth in this scenario. Because policymakers are
assumed to recognize these more favorable supply-side conditions, the path of the federal funds
rate is about ¼ percentage point lower, on average, than in the baseline.

GDP growth to slow from about 2¼ percent in 2019 to about 1½ percent in the next three
8 A natural rate of 3.75 percent is comparable with the average of the 10 lowest forecasts for the longer-run
unemployment rate submitted by respondents in the March 2019 long-range Blue Chip survey.

years—a modestly weaker path than in the Tealbook baseline.9 The projected deceleration in y
t
n
GDP mainly reflects both consumption and business investment growth moving down from what ai
t
r
the model perceives as unusually strong readings in recent years. In the case of consumption, the e
c
n
model could not explain those earlier positive surprises based on fundamentals (wealth and U
&
income) and, hence, does not carry that strength forward in the projection; instead, it has s
k
s
consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend. The model’s assessment that asset Ri
prices (equity and property wealth) are currently above normal valuations and thus will fall or
decelerate over the next year also contributes to the weakening in consumption growth through
the wealth channel. With slowing overall output growth, business investment decelerates.
Marked negative contributions from net exports also weigh on the model’s forecast of real GDP
growth. Given a projection of output growing slightly below that of potential, the output gap
declines from the model’s current estimate of a bit more than 1½ percent to about ¼ percent at
the end of 2022, and the unemployment rate rises to 4½ percent at the end of 2022, slightly
below the model’s estimate of the natural rate of 4.7 percent. Core inflation increases from
1.8 percent in 2019 to about 2.0 percent, on average, over the next three years.
The EDO model projects GDP growth to fall to 1.9 percent, on average, over the next
three years, about the same as the Tealbook projection, as favorable risk premium shocks (the
main driver of aggregate demand in this model) and the effects of previously accommodative
monetary policy fade. Because this pace is below the EDO model’s estimate of potential growth
and because this model already assesses that the output gap is near zero, the model projects the
gap to fall below zero in the near term and reach negative ½ percent by the end of 2021.
Nevertheless, by next year, the model predicts that core inflation will modestly overshoot the
FOMC’s 2 percent objective, driven by persistent adverse shocks to investment, which lower
productivity and raise costs.
9 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projections for variables from the U.S. government
sector, foreign real GDP growth, foreign inflation, and the paths of the U.S. dollar and oil prices. The federal funds
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline. The model forecast starts in the
fourth quarter of this year, taking as given key macroeconomic variables from the judgmental forecast for the
third quarter.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
t
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. The staff’s current projection incorporates
significantly less tightness in resource utilization than in the July Tealbook, reflecting
both a downward revision to the forecast for real GDP and a higher trajectory for
potential output. Additionally, the staff revised down slightly its forecast of core PCE
inflation for this year and the next. As a consequence of these revisions, the policy rate
paths discussed herein are notably lower than in the July Tealbook. An additional exhibit
provides updated estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four simple policy rules: the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and a flexible price-level targeting (FPLT)
rule.1 These near-term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for
the output gap and core inflation, which are shown in the middle panels.2 On average,
over the projection period shown, the staff lowered its projection for the output gap
0.7 percentage point and marked down its core inflation forecast a bit. The top and
middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate.
 Reflecting the smaller output gap and slightly lower core inflation, the near-
term prescriptions of the policy rules are lower than those in the July
Tealbook.
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes higher policy rates than the
Tealbook baseline in the next two quarters because it responds more strongly
1 The appendix in this Tealbook section provides technical details on these simple policy rules.
Except for the first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined herein use
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of
the projection for the output gap.

1. The lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for

2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the June 2019 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline

to the positive output gap than the conditional attenuated rule underlying the
Tealbook baseline projection.
 The Taylor (1993) rule, which does not feature an interest rate smoothing
term, calls for higher policy rates than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule.
 The first-difference rule, which responds to the change in the expected output
gap, prescribes a fairly flat policy rate path in the near term—one that is
similar to the Tealbook baseline path.
 The FPLT rule calls for cutting the federal funds rate to below 1¾ percent by
the first quarter of 2020 in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the
core PCE price index of 2¾ percent since the end of 2011.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*) generated under two baselines: the
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2019 SEP.3
In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used. This concept of r*, labeled
“FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained
over a 12-quarter period starting in the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero
in the final quarter of that period. This concept of r* is a summary of the projected
underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into account considerations
such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal
funds rate.
 At 1.40 percent, the current value of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is
about 60 basis points lower than the value consistent with the July Tealbook.
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2021 (the
final year reported in the June 2019 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth and
monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

This reduction reflects the smaller output gap projected by the staff in the
medium term.
 At 0.65 percent, the June 2019 SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is lower than the
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*, even though the two projections contain
similar policy rate paths. This difference in FRB/US r* arises because, even
after the staff’s downward revision to the output gap, the current Tealbook
projection embeds more resource tightness than does the SEP-consistent
projection.

M
that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the
implications for interest rates and the economy.
 Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook
baseline, the federal funds rate holds steady this year at 2.2 percent and then
edges up gradually, reaching 2.5 percent in late 2021.
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output
gap, calls for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace and to peak
slightly above 3 percent in 2021. Thereafter, the path remains above the
Tealbook baseline path for several years. The less accommodative monetary
conditions result in an unemployment rate path that, in contrast to the
Tealbook baseline, holds fairly steady at 3.7 percent next year before rising
toward the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. Under this
rule, inflation is lower and the real 10-year Treasury yield is higher than the
corresponding values in the Tealbook baseline.

 Because the Taylor (1993) rule has no interest rate smoothing term, it calls for
increasing the federal funds rate to a bit above 3 percent by early 2020, after
which the rule calls for slight declines. The federal funds rate path prescribed
by this rule is above the corresponding path of the Tealbook baseline rule, but
the rates prescribed by the two rules move closer together in 2020 and beyond.
 The first-difference rule, which reacts to the expected change in the output
gap rather than its level, prescribes small, gradual increases in the federal
funds rate through the beginning of 2021, followed by a sequence of slight
reductions during the period in which the output gap is projected to narrow.
The resulting federal funds rate path edges below the prescriptions of the
conditional attenuated rule in 2023 and subsequently remains slightly more
accommodative than the baseline funds rate path for several years. As a
result, this strategy generates higher inflation and a lower unemployment rate
than the staff projection and a path of the real 10-year Treasury yield that runs
below the trajectory under the baseline rule.
 The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate, the cumulative shortfall of
the level of core PCE prices from a target path defined by the growth of that
price level at an annual rate of 2 percent from the end of 2011 onward.
Eliminating the current 2¾ percent shortfall requires inflation to run above
2 percent in coming years. Because the simulation embeds the assumptions
that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the
real 10-year Treasury rate immediately drops to negative 0.85 percent and
remains below the corresponding Tealbook baseline path throughout the
period shown. The unemployment rate is substantially lower under the FPLT
rule than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping to
3 percent in late 2021. Inflation exceeds 2 percent by about 20 basis points,
on average, over the next decade.
 The policy rate prescriptions from the simple policy rules are lower than those
in the July Tealbook by an average of 35 to 50 basis points over the projection
period shown. This change reflects a lower projection for the degree of
resource utilization and a slightly weaker outlook for inflation. As a result of

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

the smaller output gap, there is somewhat less dispersion in prescribed policy
rates across rules over the projection period than was the case in the July
Tealbook.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations conditional on the Tealbook
baseline under two different assumptions about policymakers’ preferences, as captured
by alternative specifications of the loss function.4 The concept of optimal control
employed here is one in which current policymakers are able to commit future
policymakers to their plans; such a commitment, when feasible, may lead to improved
economic outcomes.5
 The simulation labeled “Equal weights” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the federal funds rate runs significantly higher than
the Tealbook baseline path, reaching a peak of 4.4 percent at the end of 2021.
This strategy is designed to counter the projected persistent undershooting by
the unemployment rate of its natural rate that occurs in the Tealbook
baseline—an outcome that policymakers with the equal-weights loss function
judge to be undesirable. The less negative unemployment gap implies only a
modestly lower path of inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response
of inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.
 The simulation labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but is otherwise
identical to the specification with equal weights. Under this strategy, the path
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that may not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

for the federal funds rate is essentially flat over the medium term and only
slightly below the current Tealbook baseline path. Policymakers choose this
slightly more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to
keep inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the
unemployment rate falling below its natural rate. The tighter labor market
pushes inflation more promptly toward 2 percent than under the baseline.
 Over the projection period shown, the federal funds rate prescriptions from the
equal-weights and asymmetric specifications conditional on the current
Tealbook projection are, on average, about 70 basis points and 35 basis points
lower, respectively, than their corresponding prescriptions based on the July
Tealbook.6 The revisions to the asymmetric specification are somewhat
smaller than those for the equal-weights specification because policy in the
former specification is only affected by revisions to the unemployment gap
when the unemployment rate is above the estimate of its natural rate.
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The next exhibit updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds
rate in the longer run, denoted rLR. This concept is the rate consistent with the economy
operating at its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated.
This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer-run level
of the nominal federal funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and
economic models. In addition, rLR is also a parameter in many of the simple policy rules,
including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of
Tealbook A.
 The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of historical values through
2019:Q2 for several model-based time-series estimates of rLR.7 The estimates
6 After these downward revisions, the current-Tealbook optimal control policy prescriptions under
the equal-weights loss function remain above the corresponding prescriptions using a baseline consistent
with the June 2019 SEP (shown in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the July 2019 Tealbook A).
The policy rate prescriptions under the asymmetric loss function using current-Tealbook projections are
similar to those derived using the SEP-consistent baseline.
7 See the appendix to this section for sources and methodology. Although the modeling
approaches and econometric techniques differ across models, the studies have the common feature that they
use time-series methods to infer rLR from the co-movement of either macroeconomic series (like inflation,

The range and mean of the 2019:Q2 point estimates are similar to the
corresponding statistics reported for 2019:Q1 in the June Tealbook.
 Time-series estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as
depicted in the middle panel. The sources of this uncertainty vary across the
studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach as well
as the uncertainty that exists within each model about the prevailing state of
the economy and the model’s parameter estimates.
 The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer-term estimates of the real federal
funds rate from selected sources. The Tealbook baseline assumption, at
½ percent, is similar to, or only slightly below, the median values reported in a
number of surveys as well as the most recent estimate from the Congressional
Budget Office.
 The evidence presented in this exhibit, taken as a whole, indicates that the
Tealbook baseline rLR assumption is broadly in line with time-series and
survey estimates, especially because all of these estimates are subject to

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
s
e
gi future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
e policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
t
a
r macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as

M
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.

The first rule in the table was studied by Taylor (1993). The inertial Taylor (1999) rule
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time compared with the
Taylor (1993) rule. The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap, like the
FPLT rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 The conditional
attenuated rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but responds less strongly to
the output gap. Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝐿𝑅, are constant
and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objective and an
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent. The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
2 For applications, see, for example, Erceg and others (2012). An FPLT rule similar to the one
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2015).

To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
s
e
gi gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
e consistent economic projection. This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
t
a
r some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.3 The
t
S
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
y
c
li expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
o
P variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
y
r
a
e t The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
n
o consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
M
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the
difference between four-quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝑃𝐶𝐸, and the Committee’s
𝑡
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps (𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 , measured as the difference between
𝑡
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the
federal funds rate. In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, 𝛽 = 0.9963:
𝑇
𝑳 = ∑ 𝜷𝝉{𝜆 (𝜋𝑃𝐶𝐸 −𝜋𝐿𝑅)𝟐+𝜆 (𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 )𝟐+𝜆 (𝑅 −𝑅 )𝟐}.
𝒕 𝜋 𝑡+𝜏 𝑢,𝑡+𝜏 𝑡+𝜏 𝑅 𝑡+𝝉 𝑡+𝝉−𝟏
𝝉=𝟎
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the
specifications of the loss function. The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two
specifications.

𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 < 0 𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 ≥ 0
𝑅
𝑡+𝜏 𝑡+𝜏
Equal weights 1 1 1 1
Asymmetric weight
1 0 1 1
on ugap
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the
absolute) values of the weights.
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates. Policy tools other than the
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy
decisions made prior to the simulation period.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The top panel of the exhibit “Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of 𝑟𝐿𝑅 from eight time-series models based on the
following studies: Christensen and Rudebusch (forthcoming); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni,
and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016);
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2019); and Lubik and
Matthes (2015). For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data
through 2019:Q2. Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they
make use of historical data only up to that point in time. As a result, their historical movements
can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.
s
e
gi The middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each model’s point
e
t estimate for 2019:Q2. The computation and interpretation of these bands are specific to
a
t r each study.
S
y
c
li The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝐿𝑅 values from selected forecasters. These values were
o
P obtained as follows:
y
r
a
t
e  “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real
n
o
federal funds rate in the longer run.
M
 “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal funds
rate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the
June 2019 SEP.
 “Median Survey of Primary Dealers” equals the long-run median dealer forecast for
the target rate minus the longer-run median dealer forecast of PCE inflation as of the
July 2019 survey.
 “Median Blue Chip (6-to-10-year)” equals the consensus five-year average (2026–
30) forecast for the three-month Treasury bill rate minus the consensus five-year
average (2026–30) forecast for the annual change in the GDP chained price index as
of the March 2019 Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey.
 “Congressional Budget Office (10-year)” equals the federal funds rate at the end of
2029 minus the annualized change in the PCE index at the end of 2029 as of
August 2019.
