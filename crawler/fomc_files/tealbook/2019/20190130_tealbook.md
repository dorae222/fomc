Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Despite the wide swings in financial markets in recent months, the latest D
n
economic news suggests that real activity continued to increase at a solid pace through o
c
E
the end of last year. Based on the data we have in hand, we estimate that real GDP rose c
ti
s
2.8 percent at an annual rate last quarter, led by a 4 percent annualized increase in private e
m
domestic final purchases. Moreover, job growth has shown no sign of slowing. That o
D
said, we judge that some of the strength in economic activity at year-end will prove
transitory, and the tightening in financial conditions in recent months and moderation in
some measures of business and consumer sentiment lead us to project a slower pace of
growth this quarter. Our current forecast also assumes the federal government shutdown
will hold back GDP growth in the first quarter. In all, real GDP is now projected to
increase at a 2.3 percent pace this quarter and a 2.6 percent pace next quarter, with the
overall first-half gain similar to our December Tealbook forecast.
A key question for our projection is how to interpret the financial market
movements over the past several months. Among possible interpretations, one is that
financial market participants are more attuned to an underlying weakness in the economy
than we are, that the nonfinancial indicators we monitor are just lagging behind, and that
the prospective slowing in economic activity will be sharper than we are projecting. A
second possibility is that financial market participants are only now coming to grips with
the idea that waning fiscal and monetary policy stimulus will cause economic activity to
decelerate. This second interpretation suggests that a soft landing can be a little bumpy if
not everyone has anticipated it, but it would not suggest a need for a major recalibration
of the forecast. We are currently placing more weight on the second interpretation, and
our baseline projection reflects that judgment. This assessment is in line with the
predictions of near-term GDP growth from statistical models that take into account the
conflicting signals from a broad set of financial and nonfinancial variables (see the box
“Recent Financial Market Movements and GDP Nowcasting”).
That said, we have reduced our projection of GDP growth a little this year in
response to lower projected stock prices, a widening in corporate bond spreads, and our
judgment that concerns about the fiscal impasse, trade policy, and the global economic
outlook will restrain investment and consumer spending by somewhat more than we had
previously anticipated. Although the effect of these influences is cushioned somewhat by

Recent Financial Market Movements and GDP Nowcasting
&
l
e
v Since the close of the December Tealbook, various indicators of economic activity
e
D
have been sending divergent signals about near-term economic growth. On the one
n
o hand, financial market indicators, including equity market indexes, the VIX, and
c
E
corporate bond spreads, deteriorated in December, though they have somewhat
c
s
ti
recovered since. On the other hand, data on labor market conditions and
e
m consumption spending have been persistently upbeat. Because the Board staff’s
o
D dynamic factor model (DFM) incorporates a broad variety of economic indicators into
its estimates, it is a useful tool to evaluate what these divergent signals might imply
for near-term economic growth. On net, the DFM estimates of GDP growth for the
fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 have changed little since the
December Tealbook, as downward contributions from financial variables have been
offset by the positive news from consumption and labor indicators.
The figures on the following page display the weekly evolution of the DFM forecasts
of real GDP growth for 2018:Q4 and 2019:Q1 since the September Tealbook, as well as
the contributions to the DFM forecast revisions from various sources. The black lines
indicate that, on net, the forecasts have changed little since early December (though
they are down materially since September). The forecast for the fourth quarter has
revised down from 2.2 percent on December 6 (the last time we ran the model before
the December Tealbook closed) to 2.1 percent on January 16, while the forecast for
the first quarter has revised up from 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent.
These small net changes reflect the offsetting signals from financial and nonfinancial
indicators. The red bars represent the contribution of financial variables to the
forecast revisions, which, taken together, have lowered the forecast for Q4
0.2 percentage point and the forecast for Q1 0.6 percentage point since the December
Tealbook. In contrast, nonfinancial variables, including both official releases and
survey data, boosted the model’s fourth-quarter forecast 0.1 percentage point and
the first-quarter forecast 0.7 percentage point, as the data on consumption (the dark
blue portion of the bars) and labor markets (the light blue portion of the bars) have
generally been positive.
The ongoing partial government shutdown has been affecting the data flow that we
rely on for our factor model estimates. When we do not receive economic data
produced by federal statistical agencies, the model places more weight on the
available information, including financial data and survey data. Since the December
Tealbook, survey data from manufacturing firms and consumers have come in worse
than expected by the model, leading the model to revise down the current quarter
0.4 percentage point (the orange portion of the bars).

D
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2019 is close to the Blue Chip
n
o
consensus forecast and below the median projection from the Survey of Professional
c
E
Forecasters, although the latter dates from mid-November. The staff’s GDP forecast is
c
s
ti
¼ percentage point higher than the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2020. The staff’s
e
m unemployment rate forecast is below the Blue Chip in both 2019 and 2020. The staff’s
o
D projection for CPI inflation is below the Blue Chip in 2019 but above it in 2020.

t l lower paths for interest rates and the dollar, the GDP growth projection for 2019, at
u
O
2.2 percent, is 0.2 percentage point weaker than in the December Tealbook. GDP growth
&
e l in 2020 is also revised down slightly.
v
e
D
n
o Even so, the broad contour of our forecast remains close to that in the December
c
E
Tealbook. GDP is projected to decelerate noticeably over the forecast period, largely
c
ti
s because of the effects of tighter monetary policy and waning fiscal stimulus. Enacted
e
m
o tariffs also impinge on growth slightly. With GDP growth above trend this year, the
D
output gap is projected to widen to 2.7 percent in 2020 before starting to narrow in 2021.
As a result, we expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3.5 percent this year, remain at
that level in 2020, and then edge up to 3.6 percent in 2021, still 1 percentage point below
our estimate of its natural rate.
The data on inflation have come in largely as expected. Over the 12 months
ending in December, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 1.7 percent and core PCE
prices increased 1.9 percent, both the same as in the December Tealbook forecast. As
resource utilization tightens somewhat further, year-over-year changes in core PCE prices
are projected to reach 2 percent by the third quarter and to hold steady thereafter.
Reflecting movements in oil prices, total PCE inflation is projected to dip further below
core inflation in the near term but to move back in line with it over the medium term.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
In the period between the December Tealbook and the December FOMC meeting,
stock prices declined and corporate bond spreads widened. Although they subsequently
reversed a portion of those moves, relative to the assumptions embedded in the December
Tealbook projection, equity prices and corporate bond spreads are a bit less supportive of
economic activity in this forecast.
Monetary Policy
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use to mechanically set
our assumed path for the federal funds rate continues to project a substantial
increase over the next three years—one that we recognize is out of line with
the expectations of most private forecasters. We assume the federal funds rate
will increase 1¼ percentage points this year, ¾ percentage point in 2020, and
¼ percentage point in 2021, reaching 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.

This trajectory is a bit lower than in the December Tealbook due to a slightly t l

lower projected output gap.

predictable decline until early 2020 and that the level of reserve balances in n

the longer run will be $1 trillion. E

• The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise from an average of 2.9 percent
in the current quarter to 4 percent by the end of 2021. About half of the
projected increase reflects our assumption that market participants will revise
up their expectation of short rates relative to what is currently embedded in
longer-term yields. The remainder is due to our assumption that downward
pressures on the term premium will diminish over time. Relative to the
December Tealbook, the path for the 10-year Treasury yield is revised down
an average of 35 basis points this year, reflecting the lower path of the federal
funds rate over the valuation window as well as our assumption that the recent
decrease in the term premium will unwind only gradually. In 2020 and 2021,
the lower federal funds rate in this projection shows through to about a
15 basis point downward revision to the 10-year Treasury yield.
The federal funds rate is projected to rise above the 10-year Treasury rate
o
in the second quarter of 2020, a quarter earlier than was projected in the
December Tealbook.
• Corporate bond spreads have widened, as triple-B corporate yields have not
mirrored the declines in comparable-maturity Treasury securities since the
time of the December Tealbook. We expect that a more pessimistic outlook
for business-sector activity will keep corporate bond spreads elevated through
the end of 2019, a little longer than in the December Tealbook.
• In contrast, spreads on mortgage rates have not widened, and the 30-year fixed
mortgage rate is revised lower, essentially in line with the 10-year Treasury
yield.

Equity Prices and Home Prices t l
u
O
• In the current quarter, equity prices are projected to be 2.3 percent lower than &
l
e
in the December Tealbook. Taken together with the lower path for 10-year v
e
D
Treasury yields, stock market valuation pressures now appear to be less than
n
o
in December. Accordingly, we have nudged up our assumed annualized stock c
E
price appreciation going forward to 1.2 percent per year, compared with ti c
s
e
0.4 percent per year in the previous Tealbook.
m
o
D
• The rate of increase in house prices slowed from 6 percent in 2017 to
4.5 percent last year, and we project a further slowing to an average pace of
about 2.5 percent per year over the next three years. That expectation reflects
both our assessment that house prices currently are modestly elevated relative
to rents and the projected rise in mortgage rates.
Fiscal Policy
• We assume that the partial government shutdown that began on December 22
will last until the end of January and that it will push down first-quarter GDP
growth a few tenths, with an offsetting boost to growth in the second quarter
after the shutdown has ended (see the box “The 2018–19 Federal Government
Shutdown”). If the shutdown continues much longer than we have assumed,
the consequences would likely be substantially larger.
• We assume that the expansionary fiscal policies enacted over the past year and
a half will continue through the medium term.1 Given these policy
assumptions, we continue to project that discretionary fiscal policy actions
across all levels of government (exclusive of any multiplier effects and
financial offsets) contributed 0.7 percentage point to the rate of growth in
aggregate demand last year and will contribute 0.6 percentage point this year,
0.5 percentage point in 2020, and 0.2 percentage point in 2021.
• We expect the federal budget deficit, which stood at 3¾ percent of GDP in
fiscal year 2018, to widen to just over 5½ percent by fiscal 2021, primarily
1 In particular, our forecast assumes that the current level of discretionary spending will be
maintained in real terms in fiscal years 2020 and 2021; realization of that forecast will require lawmakers to
lift the discretionary spending caps for those years, which would be consistent with fiscal policymaker
actions in recent years.

The 2018–19 Federal Government Shutdown
&
l
e
v A partial shutdown of the federal government began on December 22, 2018, because
e
D
7 of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund government operations had not been
n
o enacted and temporary funding provisions had expired. This funding lapse affects
c
E
agencies that were expected to account for about one-fourth of federal discretionary
c
ti
spending in fiscal year 2019. Since the shutdown began, roughly 400,000 federal
s
e
m employees deemed nonessential have been furloughed, and an additional
o 400,000 employees deemed essential have been working without pay.1 As in previous
D
shutdowns, both furloughed and nonfurloughed employees will receive back pay
after the shutdown is resolved.2 As of January 18, 2019 (the Tealbook publication
date), the current shutdown has lasted 28 days, the longest funding gap since the
Congress created the current budget process in 1976.3
Although there is substantial uncertainty regarding when the current shutdown will
end, we assume the government will fully reopen on February 1 (a shutdown length of
six weeks). The direct effect of a shutdown on GDP is the value of lost government
production that results from furloughing workers and forgoing the purchase of other
goods and services (such as pay for contractors).4 We estimate that each additional
week of the current shutdown lowers real GDP growth around 0.05 percentage point
at an annual rate (a.r.) through this channel, mostly reflecting lost government
production from furloughed workers.
The shutdown could also affect real economic activity through spillover effects on
private-sector demand as a result of lower consumer and business confidence;
delayed government payments, including pay for federal workers; and delayed
issuance of permits, regulations, and processing of information required for private-
sector transactions. Although difficult to quantify, we assume these effects will
reduce real GDP growth about 0.10 percentage point (a.r.) in the first quarter. If the
shutdown persists beyond our assumed end date of February 1, the spillover effects to
the private sector could become substantially larger.
We project that the current funding lapse lowered real GDP growth 0.05 percentage
point (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting the effect of furloughed workers.
1 Affected agencies account for roughly one-third of nondefense civilian employment. Some
federal agencies may change their classification of employees as the shutdown continues. For
example, since the shutdown began, the Treasury reclassified about 50,000 IRS employees from
nonessential to essential so that tax returns can be issued. For a discussion of the effect of the
shutdown on the labor market, see “The Outlook for the Labor Market and Aggregate Supply” in
this section.
2 The Congress has passed, and the President has signed, legislation that will provide back pay
for all federal workers affected by the shutdown.
3 By comparison, the October 2013 shutdown lasted 16 days but affected more agencies and
employees than the current one.
4 Federal employees who remain on the job without pay do not contribute to the reduction in
real GDP through this channel.

In the first quarter, we project growth will be 0.35 percentage point (a.r.) lower, as O
workers remain furloughed, other government purchases are held down, and as the &

spillovers to households and businesses further reduce growth. We project output e
v
growth will be boosted 0.40 percentage point (a.r.) in the second quarter as e
D
government production and private sector activity return to baseline levels. n

The shutdown has also delayed data releases from affected federal agencies c

number of government data series that would typically inform the staff projection

have not yet been released, and other series will likely be delayed even if the D
shutdown ends before their scheduled release. Once the government reopens, we
will learn about the schedule for publication of these data releases.

Trade Policy
• Since the December Tealbook, trade talks between the United States and
China have resumed, and no new tariffs have been imposed. In particular, the
additional 15 percent tariff increase on many imports from China has been
postponed to at least March 2. We continue to assume tariff rates on Chinese
imports will remain at current levels through the medium term. We have also
not adjusted our forecast to reflect any developments concerning the recently
signed trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, which still
must be ratified by each country’s legislature. Given the ongoing uncertainty
about trade policy, trade developments will likely remain a focus of market
attention and continue to pose a risk to the economic outlook.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
• We estimate that foreign GDP growth remained at around 2 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year, noticeably below its potential rate of 2.5 percent for
the third consecutive quarter. The fourth-quarter estimate is 0.3 percentage
point lower than projected in the December Tealbook, as data came in weaker
than expected in the euro area and China. Part of the weakness is likely
attributable to temporary factors, such as transportation disruptions in the euro
area. As such, we expect growth to edge up to 2.3 percent this year and then
to run close to potential in 2020 and 2021.
• Since the December Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has depreciated
1.5 percent as U.S. interest rates moved down relative to foreign rates.
Looking ahead, we expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate

• Despite some recent swings, the spot price of Brent crude oil is unchanged, on e s

net, since the December Tealbook, at $61 per barrel. Farther-dated futures o
D
prices are also unchanged, and the futures path through 2021 remains flat.
After declining by almost one-third between mid-October and mid-December,
largely in response to supply developments, prices declined further to $50 per
barrel in late December, as concerns about the strength of global demand
intensified. Global demand concerns continue to weigh on oil prices as well
as on nonfuel commodities prices, which are down slightly since the
December Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We currently estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2018, ½ percentage point faster than in the December Tealbook.2
We continue to expect some moderation in the pace of activity this quarter. The median
prediction of first-quarter GDP growth from the Federal Reserve System’s suite of
nowcasting models—which condition on a wide assortment of indicators, including
financial market variables—is well aligned with the 2.3 percent pace we are currently
projecting.
• Consumer spending growth appears to have remained strong toward the end
of 2018. Upward-revised retail sales figures show outsized gains in both
October and November, and the available indicators for December—including
motor vehicle sales, credit and debit card transactions, and chain-store sales—
point to another increase in overall consumer spending in December. Even
after conditioning on the robust labor market, consumer spending growth in
recent quarters has been unusually buoyant, and we expect to see some
2 The BEA’s advance NIPA estimate for the fourth quarter was originally scheduled to be
published on January 30, the second day of the FOMC meeting. Due to the government shutdown, this
release will likely be delayed. We expect the BEA to issue a revised schedule for data releases after the
government reopens.

quarter after a third-quarter slowdown and increased at an annual rate of

D
almost 5 percent in the second half of last year, faster than our projection in
the December Tealbook. As before, we expect the pace of investment growth
to soften this year as interest rates rise further and business output growth
slows from an elevated pace in 2018. Contrary to our expectation, corporate
bond spreads have risen further since the December Tealbook, a sign that
perceived risks to the outlook for business-sector activity have increased. In
addition, capital goods orders excluding aircraft were weak in November, and
a number of recent readings on business sentiment have deteriorated, although
they still appear broadly consistent with growth in investment in the near
term. Taking all of these factors into account, we downgraded our forecast for
growth in business fixed investment in 2019 from 3½ percent to 2½ percent.
• The limited incoming data on housing activity since the December Tealbook
have been about as we had expected. We currently estimate that residential
investment moved down at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the second
half of 2018. We project a further decline in the first half of this year,
consistent with downbeat indicators of housing demand.
• Smoothing through some wide quarter-to-quarter swings, we now estimate
that net exports subtracted about ¼ percentage point from GDP growth last
year. As domestic demand slows this year, import growth is expected to
decline. With export growth expected to remain at its subdued 2018 pace, net
exports are projected to reduce GDP growth by just 0.1 percentage point this
year.
• Manufacturing output decelerated in the fourth quarter but still recorded a
solid gain for 2018 as a whole. Regarding the outlook, automakers’
production plans imply a decline in motor vehicle assemblies in the first
quarter, and the latest readings on new orders from the national and regional

manufacturing surveys have softened a bit, though in general they remain at t l

We nudged down our medium-term forecast for GDP growth in response to lower n
o
c
equity prices and our judgment that heightened concerns about the economic outlook will E
c
weigh more on business investment and consumer spending than we had previously s
ti
e
m
anticipated. The effect on growth from these influences was cushioned by the lower
o
D
paths for interest rates and the dollar. We now project that real GDP growth will slow to
2.2 percent this year, down from 2.4 percent in the December Tealbook. Thereafter, we
continue to forecast a gradual deceleration in economic activity amid the ongoing
tightening of monetary policy and waning fiscal support.
• The output gap is projected to widen further this year, peak in 2020, and then
gradually narrow in 2021, ending the projection at 2¼ percent, ¼ percentage
point less than in the December Tealbook.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
The incoming data indicate that the labor market remains strong. Private payrolls
jumped in December and the gains in previous months were revised up, leaving the level
of total payroll employment at year-end well above our December Tealbook projection.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate moved up to 3.9 percent in December,
but the rise was accompanied by an outsized increase in labor force participation. As a
result, the employment-to-population ratio held steady at 60.6 percent, in line with our
previous projection.
• In the establishment survey, private nonfarm payrolls jumped by about
300,000 in December. Our translation of the microdata from the payroll-
processing firm ADP also pointed to a large increase, and the pooled estimate
of private employment growth that combines the signals from the BLS and
ADP/FRB payroll estimates stood at 270,000 in December. For the fourth
quarter as a whole, private payroll growth in the BLS data averaged about
250,000 per month, up from 195,000 in the December Tealbook projection.
• December payroll gains appear to have been boosted by unusually strong
seasonal hiring and some improvement in weather conditions relative to
Page 19 of 132

--- Page 23 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2019
k
o
o
t l earlier months. Partly as a result, we expect a noticeable step-down in payroll
u
O
growth in January.3 Even so, we took some signal from the positive payroll
&
e l surprises and continued strength in other labor market indicators and raised
v
e
D our near-term projection of monthly employment gains to a solid average pace
n
o of 190,000 per month in the first half of this year.
c
E
c
s
ti
• The unemployment rate increased from 3.7 percent in November to
e
m
3.9 percent in December, whereas we had expected it to edge down.
o
D
However, the increase mostly reflected unusually high labor force entry (from
nonparticipation into unemployment) and unusually low labor force exit (from
unemployment into nonparticipation), patterns that often unwind in the
subsequent few months. Partly as a result, we expect the unemployment rate
to edge down over the next few months. Nevertheless, given the persistent
string of upside surprises to both unemployment and participation over the
past year, we took some further signal from the December surprises and raised
our near-term projections for the unemployment and labor force participation
rates slightly.4
We expect labor market conditions to remain tight throughout the medium term.
• We project the unemployment rate will move down to 3.5 percent by the end
of this year and then remain there until 2021, when below-trend GDP growth
eventually brings about a small uptick, to 3.6 percent. The path of the
unemployment rate is a touch higher than in the December Tealbook
projection but is still about 1 percentage point lower than our estimate of the
natural rate.
3 For instance, general merchandise stores reportedly added a total of 52,000 employees in
November and December, compared with an essentially zero average gain during the holiday months in the
past few years. We therefore expect to see larger-than-usual layoffs in January. Moreover, we expect that
layoffs at private federal contractors during the partial government shutdown will temporarily depress
private employment in January. However, because legislation has already been enacted to restore back pay
for furloughed federal government employees, we do not anticipate that the shutdown will have any effect
on the government employment figures.
4 In the household survey, furloughed federal government employees should be classified as
unemployed on temporary layoff regardless of whether they eventually receive back pay. Nevertheless,
during past shutdowns, about half of furloughed employees were misclassified as employed, and, assuming
that remains true this time, we expect that the unemployment rate in January will be temporarily boosted
0.1 percentage point.

• Strong job gains and rising real wages are expected to continue to draw t l

individuals into the labor force while also damping outflows, and thus we

• Average monthly total payroll gains slow over the projection, from about E

o
• We estimate that labor productivity rose about 2 percent last year, well above D
the average pace of increases during the recovery. However, productivity data
are quite volatile, even year to year. For now, we have taken little signal from
last year’s increase, and we expect productivity growth to average a more
moderate annual rate of just above 1 percent over the medium term.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The incoming information regarding core consumer prices has been in line with
our expectations, and we continue to expect the 12-month change in core PCE prices to
remain near 1.9 percent through the near term. A decline in consumer energy prices, in
response to the fall in crude oil prices over the past 2 months, is expected to lower the
12-month change in total PCE prices from 1.7 percent in December to 1.5 percent early
this year.
• Consumer energy prices moved down at the end of last year and appear on
track for another large decline in January. Thereafter, we project consumer
energy prices will move roughly sideways over the medium term, consistent
with the flat projection for oil prices.
• We estimate that the level of effective import prices—that is, the sum of
published core import prices and tariffs levied on imports—will increase
1.3 percent in 2019 after rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second
half of 2018. We estimate that the direct effects of last year’s tariff increases
will boost the level of core PCE prices between 0.1 and 0.2 percent by 2020.
With no additional tariff changes in our forecast, import prices are expected to
rise less than 1 percent per year in 2020 and 2021, restrained by the gradual
appreciation of the dollar and consistent with moderate foreign inflation.

TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down
o
somewhat further since the December Tealbook. As discussed in the
box “The Decline in Longer-Horizon Inflation Compensation” in the
Financial Market Developments section, staff models attribute most of
the sizable decline since September to inflation risk premiums or other
risk premiums, with 5-to-10-year inflation expectations little changed.
We continue to project that the four-quarter change in core PCE prices will rise to
2 percent by mid-2019 and will remain at that level over the medium term. This step-up
in inflation reflects the further tightening of resource utilization and our assumption of a
gradual increase in the underlying trend. Given the assumed trajectory of oil prices, total
PCE inflation is projected to run slightly below core inflation in 2019 and 2020 but in
line with core inflation in 2021.
The limited new data on labor compensation have been a touch higher than we
expected but still consistent with the gradual firming we have been projecting.
• The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose
3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in December, a little above our
forecast. In the near term, we project a further uptick in the 12-month change
in this measure of wage growth.
• We estimate that compensation per hour in the business sector rose
2.7 percent over the four quarters of 2018. Over the remainder of the forecast,
we project gains of 3¾ percent per year, a pace more in line with tight labor
market conditions.
• The employment cost index (ECI) rose 3 percent over the 12 months ending in
September. Because the ECI is somewhat less cyclically sensitive than other

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK m
o
D
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will remain at
4.6 percent. Also, as in the previous Tealbooks, we assume that potential
output growth slows after 2021, as the boost to potential from fiscal policy
wanes, and that growth converges to 1.7 percent per year in the longer run.
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. The nominal yield on
10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent in the longer run.
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time.
• With these assumptions, GDP growth slows to about 1¼ percent from 2022 to
2024, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level and the contribution to
growth from fiscal policy fades. The unemployment rate moves up gradually
from 3.6 percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural rate in
subsequent years. PCE price inflation remains close to 2 percent throughout.
• With resource utilization easing only slowly and inflation remaining close to
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate moves
down gradually from 4½ percent at the end of the medium term toward its
longer-run value of 2½ percent.
5 The ECI for the period ending in December will be published on January 31, the day after the
January FOMC meeting.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Concerns about the health of the global economy have persisted, fueled by a
steady stream of downbeat foreign economic data—especially from China and Europe.
We estimate that economic growth remained relatively subdued in the fourth quarter in
both the euro area and in China. As a result, aggregate foreign growth is estimated to
have stayed around 2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter (noticeably below
potential for the third consecutive quarter) rather than picking up as projected in the k
o
o
December Tealbook.
l
t
u
O
&
Despite this substantial fourth-quarter markdown and the recession fears swirling
l
e
through the financial markets and media, we are not projecting a further slowing of v
e
D
growth abroad going forward. While underlying momentum has slowed somewhat, our n
o
c
assessment is that temporary factors (such as social unrest in France and disruptions of E
l
’
shipping on the Rhine River) account for much of the shortfall in foreign growth in the t
n
I
fourth quarter. Moreover, our recession models, which take as inputs both economic
activity data and financial market developments, continue to put the probability of a
foreign downturn near its unconditional historical average. So our baseline scenario is
one in which the foreign economies grow at a subpar pace of 2¼ percent in 2019, held
down by financial market stresses, policy uncertainty, and debt deleveraging. Foreign
growth is then projected to rise to a little above its potential pace of 2½ percent in 2020,
as monetary policies remain accommodative, policy uncertainty moderates in Europe,
and Latin America emerges from its doldrums. Compared to the more dire outcomes
highlighted by market commentary in recent weeks, this projection may appear somewhat
sanguine, but it is weaker than that of many outside forecasters.
Although our foreign outlook for 2019 is just a touch weaker than in December,
the series of markdowns in previous Tealbooks, along with the heightened volatility in
financial markets, suggest that the balance of risks around our baseline projection has
shifted further to the downside. A hard landing in China, whether triggered by a property
market correction, a further escalation of U.S.–China trade disputes, or some other factor,
remains among the most prominent of these risks. As discussed in our two “China
Slowdown” alternative scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section, a hard landing in
China would be damaging for the U.S. economy, especially if it triggered turbulence in
Page 37 of 132

--- Page 41 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2019
global financial markets similar to the volatility seen in 2015 and 2016. (The box in this
section also discusses the long-run spillovers on foreign economies from U.S.–China
tariff hikes.)
Given the jittery tone of financial markets, shocks coming from Europe could also
be consequential. In the wake of the U.K. Parliament’s recent rejection of Prime Minister
May’s proposed agreement with the European Union (EU), the risk of a disorderly no-
deal Brexit persists. Meanwhile, Italy remains vulnerable to a loss of confidence despite
its recent budget compromise with the European Commission. Finally, even though the
tone of financial markets in EMEs has improved in recent weeks, these economies remain
k
o vulnerable to a tightening of financial conditions in the context of rising global interest
o
l
u t rates. Should any of these risks materialize, elevated public debt and still very low policy
O
& rates limit scope for foreign economic policy to respond.
l
e
v
e
D We estimate that headline inflation declined sharply to just 1 percent in the major
n
o AFEs at the end of 2018, reflecting drag from lower oil prices. In addition, core inflation
c
E
l in the euro area and Japan remain depressed (below 1 percent in both economies in the
’
t
n
I fourth quarter). Against a background of subdued inflation and a modest pace of
economic activity, we expect AFE monetary policy to remain accommodative throughout
the forecast period. Indeed, given our dimmer outlook for euro-area growth and inflation,
we now expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to proceed more cautiously with its
policy normalization, waiting until mid-2020 before raising its policy rate. We also
pushed back our assumptions of the next rate hikes in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Although headline inflation also declined in the EMEs in late 2018, several EME
central banks, notably those of Mexico and Russia, tightened monetary policy to contain
inflation risks. In contrast, the People’s Bank of China eased monetary policy in
response to weakening domestic demand and concerns about the effects of trade tensions
with the United States.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Euro Area. The soft patch in the euro area appeared to persist in the fourth quarter.
Industrial production fell further through November despite a stabilization of German
car production following the slump triggered by the EU’s introduction of tighter
emission standards in September. Accordingly, we now estimate that GDP grew just
¾ percent in the fourth quarter, with output contracting in Italy for the second
Page 38 of 132

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2019
consecutive quarter. Because the fourth-quarter weakness partly reflects temporary
effects of widespread social unrest in France and disruptions to shipping from low
water levels on the Rhine River (an important transportation artery for German
industry), we project growth to rebound in the current quarter. Nevertheless, the
disappointing data suggest that underlying growth momentum has weakened as well,
likely reflecting weaker external demand and tighter domestic financial conditions.
Therefore, we expect growth to remain below potential for much of 2019 and then to
rise just above 1½ percent by 2021, supported by still-accommodative monetary
policy, solid real wage growth, and a gradual reduction of uncertainty related to
Brexit and Italy.
k
o
o
l
Core inflation fell below 1 percent in the fourth quarter, and some market-based t
u
O
measures of long-term inflation expectations have been drifting back down.
&
l
Accordingly, we now project that core inflation will remain mired around 1 percent e
v
e
this year and will rise only very gradually to 1½ percent by late 2021. In light of our D
n
subdued outlook for growth and inflation, we now expect the ECB to wait until mid- o
c
E
2020 to first hike its deposit rate and then lift it to only 0 percent in 2021. The ECB ’ l
t
n
will likely continue reinvesting maturing assets well after that, having just stopped its I
asset purchase program last month.
• United Kingdom. Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on the U.K. economy, as
evidenced by the recent weakening of business and consumer confidence, industrial
production, and PMIs. After an unusually strong third quarter (partly reflecting
favorable weather conditions), real GDP growth is estimated to have slowed sharply,
to 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
We assume that the U.K. Parliament will ultimately ratify a Brexit deal with the EU.
This result will likely involve the renegotiation of some parts of the deal and an
extension of the Article 50 withdrawal date beyond the current March 29 deadline.
As such, we continue to assume the United Kingdom will exit the EU without major
disruptions (probably by midyear) and then start a transition period during which it
will negotiate its future relationships with the EU and the rest of the world. Of
course, other outcomes—including a no-deal Brexit, a second Brexit referendum, or
even the U.K. Parliament pulling the country out of the Brexit process—are also
possible.

Long-Run Spillovers on Foreign Economies from U.S.–China Tariff Hikes
Trade tensions between the United States and China have featured prominently in fears of a
global downturn. In the near-to-medium term, there are several channels through which
increased tariffs and continued uncertainty could affect global growth. First, higher tariffs are
equivalent to a tax increase, with negative effects on consumption and investment. Second, given
China’s important role in global value chains, an increase in bilateral tariffs could disrupt supply
chains, with significant negative effects on output. Third, increased uncertainty could weaken
GDP if firms delay investment and hiring. Finally, increased trade tensions could negatively affect
sentiment and roil international financial markets.
Outside of these immediate though eventually temporary effects, a persistent increase in tariffs
k would likely negatively affect the long-run productive capacity of the economy. Higher tariffs
o
o could slow the accumulation of capital, shift resources into less-productive sectors, reduce the
l
t
u extent of competition, or interfere with the dissemination of technological advances. In this
O
discussion, we employ a particular model of trade policy effects following Caliendo and Parro
&
l (2015) to quantify the long-run losses of permanent increases in U.S.–China import tariffs on GDP
e
v in the United States and China as well as the spillover effects on other foreign economies.1 The
e
D model, which includes multiple countries and sectors and accounts for input–output linkages,
n
o focuses on the role of tariffs in spurring adverse resource reallocations.2 Higher U.S. tariffs on
c
E imports from China raise the price of those goods, increasing the production cost for U.S. firms as
’ l intermediate inputs become more expensive, thus lowering U.S. productivity and GDP. In China,
t
n
I tariffs decrease demand for those products for which China is most productive, pushing resources
into less-productive sectors and lowering overall GDP.
An important model feature is trade diversion—exporters can divert their goods to other
destinations and importers can switch suppliers—thereby mitigating the negative effect of higher
import prices. This approach highlights the main offsetting forces in analyzing the spillovers of a
U.S.–China trade war. On the one hand, countries could lose as China and the United States push
resources into less-productive sectors. On the other hand, countries could gain via trade
diversion.
Panel A in table 1 summarizes the bilateral tariffs implemented by the United States and China in
2018. To date, the United States has raised tariffs on about $235 billion of Chinese goods and
China has retaliated on about $113 billion of U.S. goods (lines 1–4). While the United States and
China agreed on a 90-day truce to negotiate a deal in late 2018, trade tensions could escalate
further this year, as shown in panel B. In particular, the United States could raise the 10 percent
tariff already in effect on $180 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent (line 5) or target a greater
amount of Chinese imports. If the totality of tariffs enumerated (lines 1–6) were implemented,
they would cover 23 percent of U.S. non-oil goods imports and 2.6 percent of U.S. GDP and would
raise the average U.S. tariff on imports from China by 15.3 percentage points. Similarly, a
retaliation by China on all imports from the United States would cover 8 percent of all Chinese
non-oil goods imports and 1 percent of Chinese GDP.

Figure 1 shows the estimated effect of the totality of tariffs shown in table 1 (lines 1–6) on real GDP D
in the world, China, the United States, and other countries or regions. Our estimates suggest that n
o
a permanent increase in tariffs would reduce the long-run level of real world GDP by about c
E
0.1 percentage point as global productivity declines. For China and the United States, the tariffs l
’
t
reduce the long-run level of real GDP by a modest 0.27 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point, n
I
respectively. Generally, we find negligible spillover effects to other countries. For most countries,
the positive spillover effect of U.S. import diversion is diminished by the negative spillover effect
from lower Chinese demand. However, Mexico gains as U.S. import demand is diverted from
China, thereby pushing resources into the relatively more-productive sectors.
All told, the model suggests a limited long-run imprint from an increase in trade barriers between
the United States and China. As such, this analysis suggests that the current heightened concerns
regarding the potential economic effects of a trade war are likely related to fears of temporary
disruptions (for example, confidence effects, supply chain disruptions, financial market volatility)
or other long-run factors that are not captured in our model, such as reduced innovation from less
competition or technology effects. As such, we view these estimates as a likely lower bound.3

3 The small long-run effect of tariffs discussed here contrasts with the large negative estimated effects of Brexit on long-run
GDP in the United Kingdom, which are between 5 and 10 percent of GDP. The larger estimated effect of Brexit can largely be
attributed to the greater importance of the EU for U.K. trade and to increased nontariff barriers as a result of leaving the EU.

We predict that the Brexit-related uncertainty will weigh on economic activity in the
near term, with U.K. growth averaging around 1¼ percent in the first half of this year
before bouncing back to almost 2 percent by the end of the year. We expect that as
Brexit-related uncertainty moderates, the Bank of England will raise its policy rate in
the third quarter of 2019, one quarter later than anticipated in the December
Tealbook.
• Canada. A glut of Canadian oil in late 2018, resulting from transportation
bottlenecks that restrained exports, is leading to deep production cuts. Moreover,
PMIs and labor market data through December point to weaker growth momentum.
k
o Accordingly, we estimate that GDP growth slowed to 1¾ percent in the fourth
o
l
t quarter, and we expect growth to further decline to 1 percent in the current quarter,
u
O
& both significantly below our December projections. Going forward, as oil production
l
e recovers, growth should rebound to 2 percent in the second quarter before settling at a
v
e
D near-potential pace of 1¾ percent thereafter. Citing low oil prices and slowing global
n
o
demand, the Bank of Canada (BOC) kept its policy rate at 1.75 percent on January 9.
c
E
’ l With a more dovish tone in recent BOC communications, we now expect only two
t
n
I rate hikes in 2019, one less than predicted in the December Tealbook.
• Japan. Following a 2.5 percent contraction (at an annual rate) in real GDP in the
third quarter due to a series of natural disasters, October data suggested the Japanese
economy was quickly rebounding. However, more recent data, including November
exports, have been weak. All told, although real GDP growth appears to have
increased to 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, growth for 2018 as a whole is estimated
to have slowed to just ¼ percent. Going forward, we project that growth, supported
by a highly accommodative monetary stance and next year’s Tokyo Olympics, will
linger just above its potential pace of ¾ percent over much of the forecast period. We
still expect a mild contraction in the second half of this year following the
implementation of a long-planned consumption tax hike in October.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. A string of disappointing data releases together with weak results from the
Chinese operations of a number of multinational companies have led to growing
concerns about a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth. Indeed, the pace of expansion
has already slowed from about 6.8 percent in the first half of 2018 to just under
Page 42 of 132

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2019
6 percent in the second. However, we had been anticipating slowing for some time
now, and we do not expect growth to deteriorate substantially further going forward.
We attribute the slowdown largely to authorities’ efforts to reduce credit growth,
which have weighed heavily on infrastructure investment and retail sales (particularly
autos). These factors should abate going forward, as the authorities have eased credit
conditions and relaxed constraints on local government financing. Indeed, growth
rates of credit, industrial production, and investment appear to be stabilizing. And
auto sales should bottom out this year as the temporary drag from the expiration of
tax incentives fades. That said, a cooling property market will continue to restrain
k
household spending, though we judge that limited inventories should reduce the o
o
l
likelihood of a sharp housing price correction. Furthermore, we expect exports to t
u
O
weaken amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Indeed, the most recent
&
l
trade data showed a widespread decline in Chinese exports, especially to the United e
v
e
States. D
n
o
c
All told, we see growth holding steady at a little below 6 percent in the current E
l
’
t
quarter, rising to about 6½ percent by midyear as stimulus kicks in and then slowing n
I
gradually thereafter in line with potential growth.
• Other Emerging Asia. The dissipation of idiosyncratic shocks in several economies
likely lifted regional growth in the fourth quarter. However, growth has slowed from
the above-potential pace of the past few years amid headwinds from moderating
global growth, a downturn in the high-tech cycle, and U.S.–China trade tensions.
Indeed, exports slowed notably in the fourth quarter, especially for high-tech goods
and autos, and especially to China. We expect growth to remain steady at a little
under 3½ percent through the end of the forecast period, with the export slowdown
offset by supportive fiscal and monetary policies and lower oil prices. This forecast
is down about ¼ percentage point relative to the December Tealbook, reflecting a

• Mexico. We estimate that growth in Mexico stepped down to 1½ percent in the
fourth quarter amid a rise in policy uncertainty. The incoming administration’s
decision to cancel a major airport project and slow privatization in the oil sector
raised concerns about its support for market-friendly policies. As a result, domestic
financial conditions tightened significantly between early October and mid-
December: Long-term interest rates rose sharply, and the peso depreciated by close

to 8 percent. Concerns about peso depreciation, together with persistently above-
target inflation and inflation expectations, prompted the Bank of Mexico to raise its
policy rate further to 8.25 percent in December. More recently, concerns about the
administration’s policies were allayed somewhat by its fiscally responsible budget for
this year, which caused the peso to appreciate and long-term interest rates to decline.
Although we marked down the near-term outlook in the December Tealbook, since
then we have not adjusted the longer-term outlook for the Mexican economy, as we
await further information on the administration’s policies. We see growth rising
gradually to a little under 3 percent by the end of 2020, but downside risks remain.

proposal currently in the congress instead of sending a brand new proposal. That
said, considerable uncertainty remains around prospects for reform.

Financial Market Developments
Investors’ risk sentiment deteriorated over the early part of the intermeeting
period, spurring increased volatility and declines in the prices for risky assets. Later in
the period, however, sentiment turned, and risky asset prices rallied. On net, equity
prices ended the period notably higher, supported in part by communications of FOMC
participants later in the period that were interpreted as signaling greater flexibility in the
conduct of monetary policy in response to adverse macroeconomic or financial market
developments. That said, market-based measures of monetary policy expectations over
the next few years ended the period only modestly lower.
 The S&P 500 equity index was down as much as 8 percent at one point during
the intermeeting period but ended the period 3.5 percent higher. On net, the
VIX fell notably, corporate bond spreads were little changed, nominal
Treasury yields declined modestly, and TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation were little changed.
 A straight read of OIS rates suggests that investors expect that the federal funds
rate will remain unchanged in 2019 and decline about 15 basis points in 2020.
However, adjusting for estimated term premiums suggests an expectation for
two 25 basis point rate hikes in 2019 and further gradual increases thereafter. s

 Foreign equity markets generally tracked the swings in U.S. markets, although M
l
price movements abroad were more modest. Overall, foreign equity prices a

registered a small increase over the period. The staff’s broad dollar index a

declined 1.6 percent amid falling U.S. yields and greater investor optimism

about prospects for some EMEs.
 As expected, the U.K. Parliament rejected the government’s Brexit deal. U.K.
financial markets were somewhat volatile after the vote, but the broader
market reaction, including in U.S. asset prices, was muted.
 The probabilities of a recession in 2019 as implied by a few statistical models
that condition on Treasury term spreads and risk premiums estimated from
corporate credit spreads have increased notably over recent months and now
range from about 20 to 40 percent.

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
Early in the period, investors’ risk sentiment generally deteriorated, prompting a
substantial decline in broad equity indexes, a sharp rise in financial market volatility
measures, and a notable widening in corporate spreads over Treasury securities. The first
leg down in risky asset prices followed the communications after the December FOMC
meeting, which were reportedly perceived as not fully appreciating the implications of
the pullback from risky assets and somewhat weaker-than-expected global data over
recent months for the U.S. economic outlook. Notable declines in risk sentiment were
also prompted by weaker-than-expected data, international trade frictions, the partial
federal government shutdown, and concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings
related in part to the outlook for global growth and trade.
Later in the period, however, equity prices rallied, option-implied volatility
declined, and corporate spreads narrowed following positive signals regarding trade
negotiations, some robust economic data releases, and communications from FOMC
participants that were perceived as suggesting that the FOMC could be “patient” in
assessing the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the
economic outlook and the future path of policy. On net, the S&P 500 index rose
3.5 percent over the intermeeting period, option-implied volatility declined notably, and
corporate spreads were little changed.
s
t
Nominal interest rates also varied substantially amid the shifts in investors’ e
k
r
a
appetite for holding risky assets. At one point during the intermeeting period, the yield M
l
on a 10-year nominal Treasury security was 26 basis points lower; a staff term structure a
ci
n
model implied that around half of this decline in Treasury yields reflected a lower term a
n
premium, consistent with a general flight to safety. Treasury yields rose subsequently,
Fi
and 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields ended the period 8 basis points, 9 basis points, and 7 basis
points lower, respectively. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward TIPS-implied inflation
compensation measures were little changed on net.
With 10- and 2-year Treasury yields falling by similar amounts, the spread
between them changed little and remained at about the 20th percentile of its distribution
since 1971. The near-term forward spread narrowed 11 basis points, on net, leaving it

around its 15th percentile since 1971.1 As discussed in the box “Recession Probabilities
from Fixed-Income Markets,” the probabilities of a recession in 2019 as implied by a few
statistical models that condition on Treasury term spreads and risk premiums estimated
from corporate credit spreads have increased notably in recent months and now range
from about 20 to 40 percent.
Investors continue to expect no change to the target range for the federal funds
rate at the January FOMC meeting. Measures of federal funds rate expectations over the
next few years fell substantially over the early part of the intermeeting period but
subsequently recovered and ended the period only moderately lower. A straight read of
forward rates implied by OIS quotes suggests that investors expect the federal funds rate
to remain unchanged during 2019 and to decline about 15 basis points in 2020. However,
a staff model that adjusts for term premiums implies that investors expect two rate hikes
in 2019 and further gradual increases thereafter.
Changes since the September 2018 FOMC Meeting
Although the net changes in U.S. risky asset prices over the intermeeting period
were, overall, positive, since the September 2018 FOMC meeting investors’ appetite for
holding risky U.S. assets has deteriorated markedly, on net, and has appeared unusually
sensitive to changing perceptions about monetary policy and the growth outlook. Over
this longer period, the S&P 500 has fallen about 10 percent, and spreads on investment-
and speculative-grade corporate bonds have widened 49 basis points and 93 basis points, t s
e
k
respectively. The widening in corporate spreads since the September FOMC meeting r
a
M
appears to reflect increases in both expected credit losses and risk premiums.2

Over the same period, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields have fallen a

27 basis points, 39 basis points, and 35 basis points, respectively. However, TIPS yields
have only edged down slightly, on net, implying that inflation compensation has fallen
substantially; 5-year and 5-to-10-year inflation compensation are 37 basis points and
1 The near-term forward spread is defined as the difference between the six-quarter-ahead forward
rate on Treasury bills and the three-month Treasury bill yield. This spread has been shown to dominate the
spread between the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields for predicting a transition to recession in the subsequent
four quarters.
2 The number of credit rating downgrades and the KMV expected year-ahead default rate have
risen substantially in recent months, which suggests that investors expect an increase in credit losses over
the next few years. In addition, staff estimates of the risk premium component of high-yield bond spreads
and of the excess bond premium (a measure of the risk premium for exposure to U.S. corporate credit risk
in excess of the compensation due to expected default) have also both increased substantially.

Recession Probabilities from Fixed‐Income Markets
Amid the recent turmoil in financial markets and the noticeable flattening of the yield curve,
market participants expressed increased concerns about the risk of recession in the U.S. economy
in the near term. This discussion provides an update of the likelihood that the U.S. economy will
enter a recession within the next four quarters based on simple statistical models. The analysis
uses three recession predictors from fixed‐income markets: two components of the slope of the
yield curve and one measure of investor risk sentiment.
The slope of the yield curve is measured with either the long‐term spread, which is the difference
between the 10‐year and the 2‐year Treasury yields, or the near‐term spread, which is the
difference between the six‐quarter‐ahead forward Treasury yield and the three‐month bill rate.
The long‐term spread is a measure of the yield curve most well known as having a statistical
relationship with recession incidence. The near‐term spread is closer to a measure of market
expectations for the near‐term direction of monetary policy. When negative, the near‐term
spread indicates that market participants expect monetary policy to ease in the year ahead,
presumably to respond to an imminent economic slowdown.
Investor risk sentiment is gauged by the excess bond premium (EBP)—the component of
corporate bond spreads in excess of an estimate of the compensation for expected losses from
defaults. The EBP is a useful leading indicator of the business cycle, as periods of elevated credit‐
market sentiment (that is, when EBP is low) are often associated with a subsequent decline in
economic activity.
The statistical analysis estimates the probability of transitioning into a recession or remaining in
one at some point in the next four quarters as a function of either the near‐term spread, the long‐
s
t
e term spread, or the EBP. The three models are estimated using data from 1973 to 2018.
k
r
a
M
As shown in figure 1, the probabilities implied by the far‐ and near‐term spreads (the black and red
l
a lines, respectively) are at the highest levels estimated in the current expansion, reaching
ci
n 32 percent and 43 percent, respectively, and are above the unconditional probability of recession
a
n
Fi of 23 percent (the dotted line). In contrast, the estimate derived from the corporate bond
market (the blue line) has increased only modestly and points to a probability of recession of
around 20 percent, as of December 2018.
Figure 2 plots the estimated probabilities from two alternative models that combine information
embedded in both the Treasury and the corporate bond markets. The model with long‐term
spreads and EBP estimated a 40 percent probability that the U.S. economy will enter a recession
over the next four quarters, and the model with near‐term spreads and EBP estimated a
35 percent probability.
All models presented here have significant statistical power for predicting a recession over the
next four quarters, and their estimated probabilities have risen markedly in recent months.
However, it should be noted that recession prediction models that include nonfinancial variables
tend to point to notably lower risk of recession.

33 basis points lower, respectively. As discussed in the box “The Decline in Longer-
Horizon Inflation Compensation,” most of the decline in inflation compensation since the
September FOMC meeting likely reflects falls in risk premiums, rather than a decline in
expected inflation.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Downbeat economic data from China and Europe, volatility in U.S. financial
markets, and trade policy concerns weighed on risk sentiment in foreign financial
markets early in the period. Subsequently, communications by FOMC participants and
increasing optimism about trade relations between the United States and China led to a
recovery in risky asset prices and AFE bond yields.
Foreign equity markets broadly followed the movements in the S&P 500 index,
although volatility in most foreign markets was relatively muted. On balance, European
equity indexes moved up moderately, while Chinese equities declined a bit. Early in the
period, below-expectations manufacturing PMI data from China and trade frictions
weighed on Chinese equity prices. The resumption of U.S. trade negotiations with China
in the second week of January boosted investor sentiment, and most of the decline in
Chinese equity prices retraced. Broad-based appreciation of the Japanese yen amid safe-
haven flows contributed to the underperformance of Japanese equities, which ended the
period 1.2 percent lower.

significantly after the government’s Brexit deal was rejected by Parliament, as market Fi
participants reportedly saw an increased likelihood that Prime Minister May would seek a
compromise with those favoring a softer Brexit. Overall, expectations for monetary
policy in AFEs over the next few years were little changed. In the euro area, measures of
inflation compensation declined moderately.
The staff’s trade-weighted broad dollar index moved down 1.6 percent.
Narrowing U.S.-AFE interest rate differentials were instrumental in driving dollar
weakness. However, the 2.9 percent dollar depreciation against the Japanese yen
appeared to be also driven by safe-haven flows. On January 2, in an environment of very
low market liquidity during early Asian trading hours, the yen appreciated sharply in a

The Decline in Longer-Horizon Inflation Compensation
Yields on longer-term nominal Treasury securities have declined appreciably since the
September 2018 FOMC, with most of the decline in nominal yields attributable to a
decline in inflation compensation as yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
(TIPS) have been relatively little changed over this period. In particular, 5-to-10-year-
forward inflation compensation fell from an annual rate of around 2.1 percent in late
September to 1.8 percent in mid-January (the red line in figure 1).
Although the decline in inflation compensation could indicate that market participants’
inflation expectations have moved lower, it also may reflect reductions in the inflation
risk premium and in “other” risk premiums. Other risk premiums tend to fall with the
relative illiquidity of TIPS as well as with increased investor demand for nominal relative
to inflation-indexed securities—for example, when investors pile into nominal Treasury
securities during times of market stress. According to the staff’s term structure models,
5-to-10-year inflation expectations have remained little changed since September 2018.
Instead, a reduction in the inflation risk premium and in other risk premiums accounts for
most of the decline in longer-horizon inflation compensation over this period.
Information about longer-run inflation expectations can be also obtained from survey
forecasts. As shown in figure 1, measures of inflation expectations 5 to 10 years ahead
based on the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey,
and the Survey of Professional Forecasters were little changed, on net, over the past few
months. Similarly, the probability distribution of longer-run inflation from the Desk’s
surveys has also remained relatively stable (not shown). In particular, survey
respondents have not materially changed the odds that they attach to either low or high
inflation outcomes.
s
e t Some additional support for the decline in risk premiums can be found in the strong co-
k
r movement of inflation compensation with equity prices since last September, as both
a
M declined sharply throughout the last quarter of 2018 (figure 2). The recent episode of
a l deteriorating risk sentiment that pushed equity prices down likely weighed on inflation
ci
compensation through two channels. First, increased perceptions of downside risks to
n
a the growth outlook coupled with a lack of upward inflationary pressures may have led
n
Fi investors to become more concerned about scenarios in which both growth and inflation
are low, leading to a decline in the inflation risk premium. Second, safe-haven flows into
Page 60 of 132

--- Page 64 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 18, 2019
nominal Treasury securities likely pushed down nominal Treasury yields and inflation
compensation through a decline in other risk premiums.1
The current episode differs a bit from the declines in inflation compensation in the
second half of 2014, when declines in inflation expectations seemed to play somewhat
more of a role. In both the current and the 2014 episode, market participants associated
the decline in inflation compensation with a plunge in oil prices (figure 3). Although it
remains unclear what specific mechanism links long-horizon inflation compensation with
oil prices, market participants noted that in both episodes the oil price declines could be
partly signaling weaker global demand and weaker risk sentiment, and these factors
might also be showing through to lower inflation risk and other risk premiums. 2
However, the most recent episode has not witnessed a global drop in inflation
compensation, while disinflationary pressures from abroad likely weighed on domestic
inflation expectations in the 2014 episode as the fall in U.S. inflation compensation
mirrored the declines in euro-area and U.K. inflation compensation (figure 4). Consistent
with these observations, the staff’s term structure model attributed about half of the
decline in longer-horizon inflation compensation during the second-half of 2014 to lower
inflation expectations and inflation risk premium, while during the most recent episode
the model estimates suggest that inflation expectations remained little changed.
On balance, the staff’s term structure model, the evidence from surveys of investors,
professional forecasters, and economists, and the shifts in investor risk sentiment over
the past months suggest that lower inflation risk premiums and other risk premiums—
rather than declines in inflation expectations—account for a bulk of the decline in longer-
horizon inflation compensation since last September. However, deducing sources of
changes in inflation compensation is sensitive to modeling assumptions, and one cannot
rule out that inflation expectations among market participants have edged down some
over the past few months.

flash event, but much of the move quickly retraced. The dollar also depreciated
significantly over the intermeeting period against some major EME currencies, including
the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, following progress on pension reform in Brazil and
a prudent fiscal announcement in Mexico, respectively. Optimism regarding trade
negotiations between the United States and China reportedly contributed to a significant
dollar depreciation against the Chinese renminbi.
Financial conditions in EMEs improved over the period. Inflows to dedicated
emerging market funds resumed after two quarters of outflows. And although EME
sovereign spreads increased moderately early in the period, they subsequently retraced
and ended up slightly lower on net.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Following the December FOMC meeting, the effective federal funds rate rose in
line with the 20 basis point increase in the interest rate on excess reserves and printed
consistently at 2.40 percent, 10 basis points below the top of the target range. Other
overnight funding rates also increased following the increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate. ON RRP take-up continued to average about $5 billion per day,
excluding year-end.
Year-end pressures in repo markets were reportedly exacerbated by a high volume
s
of settlements of Treasury securities against a backdrop of large dealer inventories and e t
k
r
reduced intermediation by global systemically important banks. General collateral rates a
M
across different platforms saw very large daily increases but have since returned to l
a
ci
normal levels relative to other money market rates. Year-end pressures in other domestic n
a
n
funding markets were limited. In overseas dollar funding markets, increases in one-week Fi
FX swap bases and draws at central bank dollar swap facilities were smaller than those
recorded at the end of 2017. Spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of
deposit with tenors exceeding 30 days remained elevated relative to their levels over
recent years, reportedly due in part to recent heavy net Treasury issuance.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Information received over the intermeeting period indicates that financing
conditions for businesses and households have tightened a bit further but remain
generally supportive of spending.
• Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed considerably in December across
the credit rating spectrum, while spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds
were volatile but little changed on net. Issuance of institutional leveraged
loans also declined as spreads widened.
• In the January 2019 SLOOS, banks reported that, on net, commercial and
industrial (C&I) lending standards eased somewhat in the fourth quarter;
however, SLOOS respondents expect C&I lending standards to tighten
somewhat and loan demand to weaken over 2019.
• Mortgage rates edged down, and mortgage credit supply conditions for
households remained generally supportive of borrowing.
• Consumer interest rates rose further, and banks continued to tighten credit
card lending standards, though consumer credit continued to grow moderately.
• The federal government shutdown appears to have had limited effects to date
on the ability of most households and businesses to borrow.
• Recent changes in financing conditions indexes support the overall assessment
that financing conditions for businesses and households are still generally
supportive of economic activity.

in January. Gross issuance of speculative-grade bonds has been slowing for several
months. Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds were volatile but little changed, on net.
Institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed in December to its lowest level since July
2016, as loan spreads widened substantially.
In the January 2019 SLOOS, a modest net share of banks reported having eased
lending standards and some terms for C&I loans in the fourth quarter, though many fewer
banks reporting having eased standards and terms than had done so in earlier surveys in
2018. Growth of C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter,
reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales. In a set of
special questions inquiring about banks’ outlooks for 2019, SLOOS respondents forecast
that lending standards would tighten for large and middle-market firms and that demand
for C&I loans would weaken, reflecting in part banks’ outlook for a general worsening in
loan credit quality.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of
deterioration, as the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades significantly
outpaced that of upgrades in December. Still, actual corporate bond defaults remained
low overall, and the six-month trailing bond default rate was about unchanged in
December. Over the intermeeting period, private-sector analysts significantly revised
down their projections for corporate earnings overall for the fourth quarter and for 2019
as a whole, with the largest revisions for 2019 in the energy and technology sectors.
The pace of gross equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings was
sluggish in December. Reports suggest that several firms have had to push back initial
equity offering plans because of the partial closure of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) during the federal government shutdown.1 Still, market participants
continue to expect 2019 to be a solid year for initial offerings, with several high-profile
offerings in train.

businesses rebounded a bit in recent months, and indicators of recent loan performance
remained strong. Demand for credit by small businesses was about unchanged, although
there are some signs of softening going forward. For example, in the National Federation
of Independent Business survey, the share of respondents with planned capital
expenditures in the next six months and the share reporting that the next three months is a
good time to expand each fell 5 percentage points in December. While anecdotal
concerns have been raised about the halting of Small Business Administration loan
applications during the federal government shutdown, these loans represent a very small
portion of total small business financing.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained generally
supportive of transactions, refinancing, and construction activity. Although CMBS
spreads have been volatile, they were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period,
and issuance of both agency and non-agency CMBS has remained strong in recent weeks.
CRE loans on banks’ books expanded at a pace comparable to the rest of the year.
According to the January SLOOS, lending standards and demand were about unchanged
in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, the largest CRE loan category.
Banks, however, reported weaker demand and somewhat tighter standards for
multifamily loans and construction loans. For 2019, banks reported expecting demand to
weaken and standards to tighten for all types of CRE loans.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets were little changed. Gross issuance
of municipal bonds slowed in December but remained at a solid level, and yields on 20-
year municipal bonds moved about in line with yields on Treasury securities. In
December, the credit quality of state and local governments improved a bit as the number
of rating upgrades slightly exceeded that of downgrades.

October and November. Lagged data on home-purchase originations continued to slide
through November, and refinancing originations remained muted through December.
Conforming loan limits for loans eligible to be purchased by the GSEs increased
in January, although this change may lead to only a small expansion of credit, as jumbo
loans were already widely available and jumbo-conforming mortgage interest rate
spreads were already low. It appears that the federal government shutdown has had only
small effects to date on aggregate mortgage activity, as the GSEs, Department of
Veterans Affairs, the IRS’s income verification program, and most FHA mortgage
programs remain in operation.2 However, the effects on the ability of some households
to borrow may increase as the shutdown continues.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets tightened a bit through late last
year against a backdrop of rising interest rates but, on balance, were generally supportive
of growth in household spending. Banks reported in the SLOOS that they tightened
credit card lending standards during the fourth quarter and anticipate further tightening
over 2019. In the consumer asset-backed securities market, spreads widened somewhat
amid broad market volatility. Nevertheless, consumer credit continued to grow
moderately through November 2018, and delinquencies on such credit remained at low
levels. In addition, the mail volume of credit card offers, a measure of credit availability,
increased appreciably in the fourth quarter.
FINANCING CONDITIONS INDEXES
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial
corporations indicates that financing conditions are still accommodative relative to
historical standards but have tightened, on net, since early September, consistent with the
widening in corporate spreads and the decline in equity prices over this period. The
staff’s SLOOS Bank Lending Standards Index, which measures the net share of banks
reporting tighter lending standards averaged across all core loan categories to businesses
and households, indicated that a slightly greater share of banks eased lending standards
2 FHA Title 1 (home improvement), HECM (equity extraction), and multifamily loans will not be
endorsed during the shutdown. The FHA will continue to endorse forward mortgages (home-purchase and
refinance loans). Mortgages guaranteed or made directly by the USDA Rural Housing Service are also
unavailable to borrowers.

than tightened lending standards over the fourth quarter compared with the historical
average. However, a smaller share of banks reported easing standards than did so earlier
in 2018. As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook section, other publicly available
financial conditions indexes (FCIs), which aggregate a large set of financial variables into
a summary series, have tightened, on net, since September, though they remain slightly
accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical standards.

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations, measures financing
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1 This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade. To the extent
that speculative-grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment-grade
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a clean measure of
changes in financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.
The second index in the table measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending
standards across all core loan categories in the SLOOS. Banks’ responses for a given loan category are
weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on their balance sheets.2
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary
series using various statistical methods. While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial
market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both changes in financing conditions
and other shocks to the economy.
1 This index was first discussed in the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” in the Financing Conditions for
Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.
2 This index is an updated version of the index developed in William F. Bassett, Mary Beth Chosak, John
C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,” Journal of
Monetary Economics, vol. 62 (March), pp. 23–40. The current index uses a new weighting approach for each loan
category.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS U

s
k
We continue to view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity over s
Ri
the next year or so as being broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years, the
benchmark used by the FOMC and a period that includes substantial volatility in real activity.
However, we do think that uncertainty has increased in recent months, reflecting the
developments that have led to heightened financial market turbulence. That said, we still judge
the upside and downside risks around the projections for real GDP growth and the
unemployment rate over the next year or so as being balanced. On the upside, the recent data on
economic activity have been more positive than we had expected. In addition, underlying
fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain strong—bolstered in part
by the tax cuts enacted a year ago—and readings on household and business sentiment generally
remain favorable. In these circumstances, consumption and investment could expand faster than
in the staff projection. On the downside, the materialization of risks associated with
developments abroad, particularly in China and Europe, could generate adverse spillovers to the
U.S. economy. Trade policies also could move in directions that have significant negative
effects on U.S. economic growth. These overall assessments are consistent with the four-
quarter-ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the unemployment rate,
conditional on current macroeconomic and financial indicators, presented in the exhibit “Time-
Varying Macroeconomic Risk.”
We remain concerned about recession risks during the period beyond the next year or so,
and the ongoing financial market volatility has added to those concerns. In our baseline outlook,
the economy is projected to move further beyond its potential through this year. If that forecast
is correct, then we anticipate that a significant slowing in the pace of economic growth along
with a gradual increase in the unemployment rate will be necessary to return the economy to a
sustainable position in the longer run. During that period of subpar growth, the economy could
be more susceptible to being pushed into a recession by negative shocks.1 Neither we nor
1 For example, the probability of a recession, based on stochastic simulations in the FRB/US model around
the baseline projection, rises from 8 percent in 2019 to 23 percent in 2021.

longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower
than assumed in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming years. Also, the foreign
exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more than expected and put downward pressure on
inflation. To the upside, with economic activity projected to move further above its potential,
inflation could increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models
that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation. In addition, an unexpectedly
widespread and sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to higher inflation. Of course, if
the risks to the forecast for economic activity beyond a year or so are tilted to the downside, then
the risks to the inflation projection would also tend to have a small downward skew at that time.
All of these inflation risks would be of relatively modest size as long as inflation expectations
remain reasonably well anchored. The risks could increase substantially, in either direction, if
expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down. Such movements in expectations could
induce changes in inflation to build upon themselves and thus lead inflation to deviate more, and
more persistently, from 2 percent.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by both the staff’s quantitative
surveillance (QS) assessment in October, which judged the overall financial vulnerabilities in the
United States to be moderate, and by recent financial developments. Net movements in financial
market prices over the past few months have decreased valuation pressures in equity, corporate
bond, and leveraged loan markets, apparently reflecting a marked reduction in investors’ risk
appetites. The reduction in appetite for corporate debt was accompanied by a marked slowing in
the issuance of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, although risky corporations do not seem to
2 This assessment is consistent with recent research, using quantile regressions, on the distribution of
fluctuations in the unemployment rate and in real GDP growth. For a discussion of the unemployment rate, see
Michael Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018-067 (Washington:
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067. For a
discussion of real GDP growth, see Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Nellie Liang, and Sheheryar Malik (2018),

(Washington: Brookings Institute, August), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WP42-NL-
updated.pdf. Their results suggest that the upside risk to the unemployment rate and downside risk to GDP growth
are more pronounced in the medium term—specifically, two to three years ahead—particularly when credit growth
is high and the unemployment rate is low.

nonfinancial-sector leverage remain moderate. Measures such as debt-to-asset ratios among the
riskiest businesses are still elevated, but concerns about leverage in the business sector are
balanced somewhat by the apparent resilience of the household sector, where borrowing has
grown moderately and only among prime-rated borrowers. Existing vulnerabilities, particularly
in the nonfinancial corporate sector, could amplify both domestic and foreign shocks, including
from developments associated with international trade policies, emerging market economies
(EMEs), or Brexit.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline
projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario illustrates a recession caused by
a substantial further correction in financial market valuations and a considerable loss in
confidence by businesses and households. The second scenario describes how the effects of such
a recession could be amplified if the downturn intensifies leverage constraints on financial
institutions, thus significantly curtailing the supply of credit. In contrast to the first two
scenarios, the third scenario illustrates the upside risk that the strong momentum in economic
activity seen last year continues, such that growth this year is faster than in the baseline. The
fourth scenario examines the possibility that there is greater supply-side capacity in the
economy—in particular, faster structural productivity growth and a higher trend in labor force
participation than assumed in the baseline. Alternatively, the fifth scenario simulates the
consequences of supply constraints binding more substantially than in the baseline when labor
markets are very tight for an extended period, causing higher inflation than in the baseline. In
the sixth scenario, we consider the possibility that an economic slowdown in China triggers
financial turbulence in the EMEs, with modest spillovers to the advanced economies. Finally,
the seventh scenario envisions that an economic slowdown in China could have more severe
repercussions on global financial markets.

Financial-Based Recession with Resilient Financial Institutions [Gertler-Karadi
Model]
Volatility in financial markets has been elevated in recent months, and further substantial
declines in asset values remain a salient risk. In this scenario, we assume such a decline occurs,
accompanied by a loss in confidence by businesses and households, such that the level of
investment is 20 percent lower than in the baseline at the end of 2020. However, we further
assume that the substantial decline in confidence and asset prices does not impair the efficiency
of financial intermediation, consistent with recent staff QS reports depicting only moderate
financial vulnerabilities and well-capitalized commercial banks. Accordingly, the spread
between the rate at which firms borrow and the deposit rate remains close to baseline.
Real GDP growth is only 0.7 percent this year and remains below baseline in 2020. The
unemployment rate starts rising this year and peaks at around 5½ percent in 2020 before moving
back toward its natural rate. Inflation moves down only slightly relative to the baseline because
the Phillips curve is flat. Reacting largely to the weaker pace of real economic activity, the
federal funds rate falls to 2 percent by the second quarter of 2021, about 2.5 percentage points
below baseline.
3 The five models used are the following: (1) a version of the model from Mark L. Gertler and Peter Karadi
(2011), “A Model of Unconventional Monetary Policy,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 58 (January), pp. 17–
34; (2) an estimated New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market and
endogenous labor supply developed by Isabel Cairó, Hess Chung, Francesco Ferrante, Cristina Fuentes-Albero,
Damjan Pfajfar, and Camilo Morales-Jiménez from the Macroeconomic & Quantitative Studies Section at the
Board; (3) a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market similar
to that described in Mark L. Gertler, Luca Sala, and Antonella Trigari (2008), “An Estimated Monetary DSGE
Model with Unemployment and Staggered Nominal Wage Bargaining,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol.
40 (November), pp. 1713–64; (4) EDO, which is an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the
U.S. economy; and (5) SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.
4 In the scenarios “Financial-Based Recession with Resilient Financial Institutions,” “Financial-Based
Recession with Vulnerable Financial Institutions,” “Stronger Aggregate Supply,” and “Supply Constraints,” the
output gap that appears in the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule is inferred from the unemployment
rate gap (specifically, the output gap is equal to the negative of twice the difference between the unemployment rate
and its long-run natural rate of 4.6 percent).

U
While the previous scenario assumed that the financial system would continue to function &
s
well over the course of the downturn, the adverse developments assumed in that scenario may k
s
Ri
lead to a deterioration in the efficiency of financial intermediation. We illustrate this risk by
replaying the previous scenario, assuming that the downturn intensifies financial constraints,
making financial institutions more vulnerable to a recession and widening the spread between the
rate at which firms borrow and the deposit rate. Specifically, we assume that the correction in
asset valuations heightens concerns regarding the underlying condition of financial
intermediaries, restricting the flow of credit to firms and further suppressing investment.
Under these circumstances, this year financial intermediaries’ net worth falls about
25 percent, and corporate bond spreads increase 300 basis points, on average, relative to
baseline. Starting in the second half of this year, output declines for three quarters before
beginning to recover, and investment falls 26 percent below baseline at the end of 2020. The
unemployment rate rises 1.4 percentage points above the baseline at the end of this year and
peaks at 7.1 percent in 2020 before returning to its natural rate. As in the previous scenario,
inflation moves down only a little relative to the baseline because the Phillips curve is flat, and it
remains about 0.1 percentage point below the 2 percent objective, on average, over the
simulation period. Monetary policy provides substantial accommodation: Even under the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule assumed here, starting in the third quarter of 2019, the
federal funds rate decreases 2.5 percentage points in response to the rapid increase in economic
slack, and it comes within ½ percentage point of its effective lower bound at the end of 2020.
Stronger Aggregate Demand [EDO]
Although the baseline projection assumes that economic growth will slow notably this
year from its strong pace in 2018, real private domestic final purchases in the second half of last
year were unexpectedly robust, and incoming labor market data have also been stronger than
expected. In contrast to the previous recession scenarios, this scenario assumes that the upbeat
readings on real activity are a signal that the strong economic momentum from last year will
continue this year.

Stronger Aggregate Supply [MQS-LM Model]
The staff projects that the labor force participation rate (LFPR) will remain essentially
constant over much of the medium term against the backdrop of a declining structural trend.
However, our assessment of the trend is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, and, indeed, the
LFPR has shown surprising strength over the past year. Moreover, business-sector productivity
growth picked up last year and could continue at that faster pace in coming years. In this
scenario, we assume that the underlying trend in the LFPR is higher and that total factor
productivity (TFP) growth is faster than in the baseline. Specifically, starting in 2017, we
assume a highly persistent exogenous increase in the willingness of households to supply labor
relative to baseline, which ultimately leaves the LFPR ½ percentage point above the baseline in
2021. Similarly, we assume that structural TFP growth since 2017 has been increasing
¼ percentage point faster than estimated by the staff and will continue to be ¼ percentage point
faster than baseline over the simulation period.
With the faster growth in potential output in this scenario, real GDP growth is
0.1 percentage point and 0.4 percentage point above the baseline in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The unemployment rate declines gradually and is about 0.1 percentage point below baseline in
2024, as most of the additional job searchers find employment rapidly and, over the longer term,
more intensive recruiting also gradually decreases the stock of unemployed workers. Inflation is
almost ½ percentage point below baseline in 2020, as the increase in TFP growth lowers firms’
costs. Mainly reflecting persistently lower inflation, the federal funds rate is around
¼ percentage point below baseline over the simulation period.
Supply Constraints [Gertler-Sala-Trigari Model]
In the baseline, although the unemployment rate is persistently below the natural rate of
unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consistent with the modest response of prices to
resource utilization seen for some time. However, some measures of wage growth have picked
up in recent months, and wages could accelerate further if employers face an increasingly tight

labor market. In particular, when the unemployment rate is unusually low, filling a job vacancy
y
t
n
becomes increasingly difficult, which could imply a reduced pace of hiring and a substantially ai
t
r
steeper rise in wages, as the value to firms of filling a vacant job increases. In this scenario, e
c
n
tighter supply constraints in the labor market push up wages, and those higher wages pass U
&
through into prices, raising inflation above baseline. We illustrate this risk using simulations
s
k
s
from a nonlinear New Keynesian model with costly search and matching frictions in the labor Ri
market.5
With greater supply constraints, the unemployment rate continues to decline until the end
of 2019 but remains about ¼ percentage point above the baseline over the forecast horizon.
However, GDP growth is close to the baseline throughout the projection as, in this model, more
intense utilization of capital partially compensates for the reduction in labor input. Wage growth
is, on average, nearly ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline for the next two years, and
real wages remain above baseline through 2023. Because of higher recruiting costs and real
wage growth well in excess of productivity growth, inflation is around 2½ percent over the
medium term. Nonetheless, because policymakers interpret the higher unemployment rate as
indicative of less tight labor utilization, the federal funds rate is only 20 basis points above the
baseline over the simulation period, as the effect of higher inflation is largely offset by the effect
of the smaller perceived resource utilization gap.
China Slowdown [SIGMA]
The disappointing tone of incoming Chinese data has renewed concerns about the outlook
for China. In our baseline, we expect policy easing to allow output to expand at around a
6 percent pace over most of the forecast period. However, the recent moderation in activity may
prove more protracted and heighten China’s vulnerability to adverse developments—such as an
escalation of trade tensions or a property price bust. In this scenario, we assume that the risk of a
slowdown in China materializes, causing distress in EMEs by reducing demand for their exports
and thus tightening financial conditions. While this scenario assumes that financial spillovers are
largely contained to EMEs, the next scenario considers the possibility of global contagion.
Specifically, GDP growth in China falls to 3 percent, leading to both weaker exports and
higher borrowing spreads (by 150 basis points) in other EMEs that push their GDP growth down

follows a somewhat shallower path than in the baseline.
China Slowdown with Global Financial Spillovers [SIGMA]
Against the backdrop of the significant market volatility seen in recent months, an abrupt
slowdown of GDP growth in China would very likely trigger more severe reverberations on
global financial markets than envisioned in the previous scenario. Here, we assume that the
slowdown in China precipitates a sharp rise in borrowing costs around the globe, with corporate
spreads rising 250 basis points in EMEs and 150 basis points in both the United States and AFEs.
Flight-to-safety flows depress term premiums on U.S. government bonds and lead to an
appreciation of the broad real dollar of 12 percent.
As this scenario entails lower foreign demand, tighter financial conditions, and a stronger
dollar compared with the previous one, the effects on the U.S. economy are larger. U.S. GDP
growth falls to just 0.3 percent in 2020, about 1.5 percentage points lower than in the baseline,
and the unemployment rate rises to 5 percent by 2022. Lower resource utilization and falling
import prices reduce U.S. core inflation to 1.2 percent in 2020. In response to tepid output
growth and below-target inflation, the federal funds rate runs below 3 percent in 2020 (about
0.5 percentage point below the previous scenario) and remains there in subsequent years.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the

ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t

e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U

s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s

deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. Compared with the December Tealbook, the current
projection for the output gap is essentially unchanged in the near term but is somewhat
narrower over the next several years. The inflation projection is little changed from the
December Tealbook. In response to these revisions, the strategies considered herein
prescribe paths for the federal funds rate that are about 10 to 60 basis points lower at the
end of 2021 than in the December Tealbook. In a special exhibit, we examine optimal
control simulations when the underlying baseline projection is consistent with the median
responses to the December 2018 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) rather than the
staff forecast.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four simple policy rules: the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the
“balanced approach” rule), the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and a flexible
price-level targeting (FPLT) rule. These near-term prescriptions take as given the
Tealbook baseline projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown in the middle
panels.1 The top and middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal
funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2
The staff’s near-term projections for both resource utilization and inflation are
essentially unchanged from their December Tealbook values. Consequently, the
prescriptions of most of the policy rules are about unchanged from those in the previous
Tealbook.
1 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of
the output gap.
2 Except for the first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"

2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the December 2018 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline

• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.
• The near-term prescriptions of the first-difference rule, which responds to the
change in the expected output gap, are slightly lower than in the December
Tealbook, reflecting lower projected output growth for later this year.
• The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate the cumulative shortfall in the core
PCE price index of about 2.4 percent since the end of 2011, prescribes setting
the federal funds rate substantially below the current target range but about in
line with the prescriptions from this rule reported in the December Tealbook.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the December 2018 SEP.3 In
both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used to generate an estimate of r*. This
concept of r*, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real federal funds
rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in the current quarter, would
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. This concept of r* is a
summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into
account considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp
changes in the federal funds rate.
• At just over 3 percent, the current value of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US
r* is 18 basis points lower than its estimate for the same quarter based on the
December Tealbook projection, shown in the center column; the difference
reflects the staff’s slightly lower output gap projection.
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2021 (the
final year reported in the December 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a
smooth and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered
in the SEP. For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

• At almost 1.7 percent, the corresponding SEP-consistent FRB/US r* based on
the December SEP is significantly lower than the Tealbook-consistent
FRB/US r*. The difference stems from the fact that the SEP-consistent
projection has output exceeding potential by a considerably smaller amount
over the medium term than does the current Tealbook forecast. This smaller
anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the median path for the real
federal funds rate implied by the SEP projections averages 1 percentage point
less than the corresponding path in the Tealbook.

• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases about
1¼ percentage points this year, ¾ percentage point in 2020, and ¼ percentage
point in 2021, reaching 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. This
trajectory is a little lower than the one in the December Tealbook because of
the narrower projected output gap.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding
Tealbook baseline values through 2021. This higher path is associated with
only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10-year Treasury yield than in
the baseline throughout 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter, because the
Taylor (1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate
4 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in
the top panel of the first exhibit.

for most of the decade. Inflation is somewhat higher than in the baseline
projection.5 The path for the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook
baseline path over the next few years, but it subsequently lies below and takes
a bit longer to return to its natural rate.
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sizable increase in the
federal funds rate. Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to
the positive output gaps that occur in the projection period, this rule prescribes
lower rates than does the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown. The
prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook
baseline through late 2020 but subsequently fall below the baseline path for a
sustained period. As a result, inflation is higher, and the real 10-year Treasury
yield is lower, than their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.
The more accommodative conditions also engender a lower unemployment
rate than in the Tealbook projection.
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first-difference rule lies a
touch above the path in the Tealbook baseline through late 2020 but then runs
below the baseline path for some years, reflecting the fact that this rule reacts
to the expected future change in the output gap rather than its level. The
associated lower path for the federal funds rate, together with the expectation
of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer-term real interest rates
and thus lower unemployment than in the Tealbook baseline.
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate, the shortfall that has
cumulated between the level of core PCE prices and a target path for that price
level that grows at an annual rate of 2 percent from the end of 2011 onward.
Eliminating the current 2.4 percent shortfall of the core PCE price index
requires inflation to run above 2 percent in coming years. To achieve this
5 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this simulation, despite higher
levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption that price and wage setters
perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond the next several years
and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage setting decisions. The box
“Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June
2018 Tealbook A presented results for a scenario in which price and wage setters lack such a perfect
understanding. In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non-inertial policy rule led to a significant
decline in inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate at the start of the simulation in response to an
unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

outcome, the FPLT rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate somewhat
below the current target range until early 2021 and below the federal funds
rate path in the Tealbook baseline through 2027 (not shown). Because the
simulation embeds the assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to
closing this gap over time and that financial market participants, price setters,
and wage setters correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal
funds rate, the path of the real 10-year Treasury rate drops and remains below
the Tealbook baseline for the next six years. The unemployment rate is
substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations
shown, dropping to 2.6 percent in 2021.
• Compared with the corresponding results shown in the December Tealbook,
the prescribed paths for the federal funds rate are lower at the end of 2021 by
12 to 24 basis points.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by three specifications of the loss function.6
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may improve economic outcomes.7
The first two of the three optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline projection, for two reasons. First, high
levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up to its
natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the unemployment rate
does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the FRB/US model. Second,
because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the
front-loading of policy tightening is not disruptive. In practice, however, if the FOMC
6 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
7 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that may not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

were to raise the real federal funds rate as abruptly as in these simulations, wage and
price setters and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions
and may anticipate tighter monetary policy than policymakers envision, leading to less
benign macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.8 By contrast, the third optimal
control policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels not experienced since
the 1950s. Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those
predicted by the simulations.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path. This strategy is designed to temper
the projected sizable undershooting, over the next several years, by the
unemployment rate of its natural rate that occurs in the Tealbook baseline—an
outcome that policymakers with the equal-weights loss function judge to be
costly. The smaller unemployment gap generates only moderately lower
inflation because, as already indicated, the response in the FRB/US model of
inflation to the current level of resource utilization is small.
• The second simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. This
simulated policy seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even
faster than under the equal-weights specification. The federal funds rate soars
to 10 percent by mid-2019 and then averages around 7 percent from 2020
through 2024.
• The third simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function that
assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate
when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but the loss function is
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate
is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds

rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with
equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path until the end of 2024; it
then exceeds the policy rate paths implied by the other two optimal control
strategies and the Tealbook baseline starting in mid-2025 (not shown). With
the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this more accommodative
path for the policy rate because their desire to keep inflation close to 2 percent
is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of
unemployment. The tighter labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent
than in the case of equal weights. Beyond the period shown, the
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as

OPTIMAL CONTROL USING A PROJECTION CONSISTENT WITH THE SEP
The optimal control simulations presented so far show how different assumptions
regarding policymakers’ preferences give rise to different policy prescriptions and
macroeconomic outcomes under the Tealbook baseline. In particular, the path for the
policy rate in the Tealbook baseline and associated macroeconomic outcomes fall
between those obtained from optimal control simulations under the equal-weights and the
asymmetric-weight-on-ugap loss functions. Here, we show that, under the SEP-
consistent baseline, the assumption that policymakers’ preferences are described by the
asymmetric loss function results in policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes that
resemble those under the SEP baseline.9
• The SEP-consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline differ in several ways.
9 As before, the simulations are carried out using the FRB/US model, implying that the marginal
effects of changes in the federal funds rate are the same under the SEP-consistent baseline as they are under
the Tealbook baseline. It is also the case that policymakers commit to following the optimal policy and that
these promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

As shown in the upper-right panel, the unemployment gap in the SEP-
o
consistent baseline is less negative from mid-2020 on than in the
Tealbook baseline. In the longer run, the natural rate of unemployment
in the SEP-consistent projection, at 4.4 percent, is somewhat lower than
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, at 4.6 percent.10
At the same time, the path for the federal funds rate, shown in the upper-
o
left panel, is lower in the SEP-consistent baseline than in the Tealbook
baseline. This lower policy path does not result in markedly higher
inflation and thus does not necessarily represent an easier stance of
policy; instead, it might reflect a lower neutral rate of interest over the
medium term.11
The path for inflation, shown in the bottom-right panel, is a touch higher
o
in the SEP-consistent baseline than in the Tealbook baseline over the
next few years.
• The policy path and macroeconomic outcomes under the SEP-consistent
baseline resemble the results of an optimal control strategy under the
asymmetric loss function based on that SEP-consistent baseline (the lines
labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap (SEP-consistent).”12
Through 2021, the deviation of the optimal control path from the path in
o
the SEP-consistent baseline averages about 40 basis points for the
federal funds rate, 5 basis points for the unemployment gap, and 3 basis
points for inflation.
10 Because of the differences in the estimates of the natural rate of unemployment in the SEP-
consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline, the unemployment gap in the Tealbook baseline differs from
the one implicit in the SEP baseline both going forward as well as in the recent past.
11 This result is reminiscent of the discussion of the medium-term notion of the equilibrium real
federal funds rate under the SEP-consistent baseline presented earlier.
12 This similarity is not found under the SEP-consistent baseline for the other loss functions
considered in this section. As an example, in a simulation with an equal-weights loss function (not shown),
the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the median SEP path (including its extension
in the SEP-consistent baseline) because the strategy seeks to temper the projected sizable undershooting by
the unemployment rate of its natural rate over the next several years.

By contrast, under the Tealbook baseline, these differences are
o
substantially larger overall, averaging about 110 basis points, 25 basis
points, and negative 3 basis points, respectively.
• Overall, these results suggest that a policymaker with an asymmetric loss
function would view the combination of the Tealbook inflation,
unemployment rate, and interest rate projections as suboptimal and would be
willing to let the unemployment rate drift substantially lower in order to
achieve somewhat higher inflation and a smoother funds rate path. By
contrast, when presented with the inflation, unemployment rate, and interest
rate projections based on the SEP medians, such a policymaker would find the
constellation of these paths nearly optimal.
• The analysis is subject to several caveats, of which we highlight two.
The median SEP projections used in the construction of the SEP-
o
consistent baseline need not correspond to the projections of any
particular respondent or of the Committee.
In constructing the SEP-consistent baseline as well as in performing the
o
simulations, the staff makes assumptions about the underlying economic
relationships that need not coincide with the perceived economic
tradeoffs of SEP respondents.
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and optimal control
simulations shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment.”

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
s
e
gi future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
e policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
t
a
r macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
t
S
commitment strategies.
y
c
li
o
P The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
y
r makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
a
e t variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
n
o uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
M
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular
model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a small
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

The first two rules in the table were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price gap like the FPLT rule have
been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1 An FPLT rule similar to the one above is
also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and chosen
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objectiv𝐿𝐿e𝐿𝐿 and an equilibrium real
𝑟𝑟
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent. The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are

value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection. This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
s
e
gi some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.2 The
e
t measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
a
r expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
t
S
y variables are determined solely by historical relationships.

e rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
n
o calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
M
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the
difference between four-quarter headline PCE price inflation, , and the Committee’s
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( , meas𝑃𝑃u𝑃𝑃r𝑃𝑃ed as the difference between
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the
𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
federal funds rate. In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, :

𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers three
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the
three specifications of the loss function. The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in
the three specifications.

The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.3 The third specification, “Asymmetric weight on
ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate
is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate
falling below the natural rate. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.
For each of these three specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is
subject to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates. Policy tools other than
the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as
