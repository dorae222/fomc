Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The tenor of the incoming information on economic activity, on balance, has D
n
become somewhat more downbeat of late. In particular, business fixed investment o
c
E
appears to have stalled in the second quarter, residential investment and manufacturing c
ti
s
output have posted outright declines so far this year, and the May reading on job growth e
m
was weak. Moreover, amid heightened concerns about trade tensions and slowing global o
D
growth, the dollar is stronger, and interest rates, equity prices, and longer-term profit
expectations have moved lower. To be sure, not all of the news has been negative: GDP
growth in the first quarter surprised us to the upside, the unemployment rate has moved
lower, and consumer spending growth appears to be on track to post a solid gain
following a weak first quarter. Even so, we now project that GDP growth will slow from
a pace of 2½ percent at an annual rate in the first half of this year to 1¾ percent in the
second half. Our forecast for the second half of 2019 is ½ percentage point below the
previous Tealbook forecast.
Many of the same factors that led us to revise down our near-term projection have
also led us to revise down our medium-term projection a little. We now expect GDP to
rise 2 percent next year and 1¾ percent the year after.1 By the end of 2021, we project
the output gap will be 2 percent, close to its level at the end of 2018 and ½ percentage
point narrower than in the April Tealbook. We now expect the unemployment rate to be
3.7 percent over the medium term; previously, we expected it to edge down to
3.5 percent.
Incoming price data are consistent with our view that the weak readings on core
price inflation earlier this year are likely to prove transitory, and, thus, we still expect the
12-month change in core PCE prices to edge up from 1.6 percent in April to 1.8 percent
by the end of this year. For the medium term, we continue to project core inflation to
edge up to 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, the same as in the April Tealbook. Total PCE
1 Our projection includes the effects of all tariffs implemented to date. We expect that by the end
of 2021, the cumulative direct effect of the tariffs enacted since the beginning of 2018 will reduce the level
of real GDP by about ¼ percent and will increase the level of core PCE prices by about ¼ percent. As
noted in the “Key Background Factors” discussion later in this section, we have not adjusted our forecast to
reflect the direct effects of possible new tariffs on imports from Mexico.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
v The staff’s projection for GDP growth is a little below the projections from both the Survey of
e
D
Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus in 2019, but it is nearly ½ percentage
n
o point higher than the Blue Chip in 2020. Correspondingly, the staff’s unemployment rate forecast is
c
E a little above the SPF and Blue Chip in 2019; the staff forecast is the same as the Blue Chip forecast
c
ti in 2020.
s
e
m
With regard to inflation, the staff’s forecast of CPI inflation is a bit lower than outside forecasters
o
D in 2019 and a bit higher in 2020. The staff’s projection of total PCE price inflation is lower than the
SPF in 2019; the staff and the SPF both have total PCE price inflation at 1.9 percent in 2020. For core
PCE price inflation, the staff is 0.1 percentage point above the SPF in 2019 and 0.1 percentage point
below the SPF in 2020.
Please note that the Blue Chip data are embargoed until June 10.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
e
D the March FOMC meeting. The following table compares the staff’s current economic
n
o projection with the one we presented in the March Tealbook.
c
E
c The staff’s projection is conditioned on a substantially lower path for the federal funds rate
ti
e s than in March, a reflection of the new policy rule that we incorporated in the April Tealbook.
m
In isolation, that lower funds rate path would have led us to strengthen our economic
o
D
projection materially. However, notwithstanding the upward surprise to published first-
quarter GDP growth, the incoming data on spending, income, and wealth have all been
below our expectations on balance; the recent movements in equity prices, the dollar, and
foreign economic growth point to a somewhat weaker outlook as well. On net, our
projection for real GDP growth is just a little stronger than in the March Tealbook.
Moreover, in assessing resource utilization, we discounted the strong GDP growth reading in
the first quarter, and, as a result, the output gap flattens out at a slightly lower level—and
the unemployment rate at a slightly higher level—than in March.
Our forecast for inflation is revised a little lower from the March Tealbook projection. In the
near term, the revision reflects surprisingly soft incoming inflation data, and further out, it
reflects the small downward revision we made in April to our estimate of underlying
inflation. Accordingly, core PCE inflation is now projected to be a bit below 2 percent
throughout the medium term.

o
o
price inflation is forecast to run below core inflation this year and to move in line with t l
u
O
core inflation in the next couple of years.
&
l
e
v
Our baseline projection incorporates our estimate of both the direct effects of e
D
recently implemented tariffs and the effects of trade tensions that feed through to changes n
o
c
in the stock market, expectations about future profits, and other financial measures. E
c
ti
Nevertheless, the recent softness in business investment and manufacturing production, s
e
m
along with the increased volatility in financial markets and the recent flatness in the yield
o
D
curve, could be signs that heightened uncertainty about trade tensions will have a more
adverse effect on the U.S. economy than we have assumed. Indeed, as discussed in the
Risks and Uncertainty section, we have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks
around our outlook to the downside.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 The baseline policy rule calls for the federal funds rate to remain at
2.4 percent in coming quarters before edging up to 2.6 percent by the end of
2021, about unchanged since the April Tealbook. By contrast, market quotes
and surveys suggest that financial market participants are anticipating a
federal funds rate that is either declining or flat over the projection period.
 Our assumptions for the SOMA portfolio, which will be detailed in the
Balance Sheet and Income Projections section of Tealbook B, imply that
downward pressure on the term premium in Treasury yields diminishes over
time.
Other Interest Rates and Equity Prices
 After declining markedly in recent weeks, the 10-year Treasury yield is
projected to rise gradually from the currently prevailing level of 2.1 percent to
3.1 percent by the end of 2021. We project that the term premium will rise
over the forecast period toward its long-run value—albeit to a slightly lower
level than in the April Tealbook—reflecting our assumption that the recent
decline in the term premium is mostly transitory. The path for the 10-year
Treasury yield is, on average, 14 basis points lower than we assumed in the
previous Tealbook.

 The projected triple-B corporate bond yield and 30-year fixed mortgage rate t l
u
O
have declined less than the 10-year Treasury yield since the April Tealbook,
&
l
resulting in slightly wider spreads. We assume that this widening is transitory e
v
e
and fades over the next two quarters. Thereafter, both rates move in tandem D
n
with the Treasury yield. o
c
E
c
ti
 Stock prices, which declined 2.1 percent since the April Tealbook (3.6 percent s
e
m
since the FOMC meeting), are expected to increase just under 2 percent per
o
D
year after the current quarter. We pushed up modestly the rate of stock price
appreciation, as the recent drop in stock prices and the 10-year Treasury yield
have eased valuation pressures somewhat. Overall, we project that the level
of stock prices at the end of the projection will be a touch lower than in the
April Tealbook. Our stock price forecast reflects our assumption that
concerns over trade tensions and global growth will gradually abate over the
forecast horizon.
Trade Policy
 Trade tensions escalated significantly in May; although we are not assuming
further escalation, it is a prominent risk. The United States increased tariffs
on $180 billion of imports from China, from a rate of 10 percent to 25 percent,
and China raised tariffs in retaliation as well.2 Additional tariffs on imports
from China have been threatened, but we have assumed that tariff rates will
remain at their current levels through the medium term.
 More recently, President Trump signaled that he would impose a tariff
increase of 5 percentage points on imports from Mexico starting June 10 in
response to migrant flows across the southern border. Until significant action
is taken by Mexican authorities to limit migrant flows, the tariffs would rise
each month, reaching 25 percent in October. As negotiations regarding these
tariffs are ongoing, we have not built them into our projection.3 If the tariffs
go into effect, passage of the USMCA trade deal may be more difficult;
2 We estimate that these tariff increases will raise core PCE prices by 11 basis points and will
lower the level of real GDP by 10 basis points after two years.
3 We estimate that a 5 percent tariff on all goods imports from Mexico would raise core PCE
prices by 6 basis points and lower the level of real GDP by 6 basis points after two years.

e
v
e  In addition, in mid-May, the Administration delayed until mid-November a
D
n decision on imposing auto tariffs. Trade developments will likely remain a
o
c
E focus of market attention and continue to pose a risk to the economic outlook.
c

s
e
m Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
o
D
 Our outlook for foreign activity is a bit weaker than in the April Tealbook.
Positive surprises in some AFEs were more than offset by weaker-than-
expected data in Canada and major EMEs, by the ratcheting up of concerns
about the escalation of trade tensions, and by the weaker U.S. outlook. We
now estimate that foreign GDP growth picked up only a touch in the first
quarter to an annual rate of 1.6 percent. We see growth abroad gradually
rising over the remainder of this year and reaching a near-potential pace of
2.5 percent by the middle of next year.
 Since the April Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated
1.4 percent. Looking ahead, we expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at
an annual rate of 1.0 percent through 2021, as market expectations for the
federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast. Due to the recent decline
in market expectations for the federal funds rate, this rate of appreciation is
notably steeper than in the April Tealbook. On net, the broad real dollar at the
end of 2021 is revised up 2.2 percent.
Fiscal Policy
 We assume that the expansionary fiscal policies enacted in 2017 and 2018 will
continue through the medium term. In particular, we assume that the current
level of discretionary federal spending will be maintained in real terms in
fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Realization of this assumption will require fiscal
policymakers to lift the discretionary spending caps for those years, consistent
with their actions in recent years; for fiscal 2020, policymakers would need to
enact legislation this year before the October 1 start of the next fiscal year.4
4 Separately, the federal government entered a debt issuance suspension period on March 4, during
which the government will use extraordinary measures to issue additional debt to the public. The

 Under these policy assumptions, the direct fiscal impetus from all levels of t l

v
e
0.5 percentage point in 2020 and 0.2 percentage point in 2021. D
n
o
c
 We expect the federal budget deficit, which was 4 percent of GDP in fiscal E
c
ti
2018, to widen to 4½ percent this fiscal year and to remain steady through the s
e
m
end of the medium term. Federal debt held by the public is projected to rise
o
D
from 78 percent of GDP in fiscal 2018 to 82 percent of GDP by the end of the
medium term.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has dropped $11 per barrel since the April
Tealbook, closing most recently at $61 per barrel. Prices rose initially in the
intermeeting period on the announcement that the United States would not
renew waivers for sanctions against Iranian oil exports. However, prices have
tumbled in recent weeks as trade tensions and softer economic data
exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth. As farther-dated
futures prices have fallen $7 per barrel, our projection for oil prices has moved
from downward sloping to nearly flat in the medium term.
 Nonfuel commodities prices have decreased 3 percent since the April
Tealbook. Metals prices have fallen about 7 percent, primarily because of
heightened trade tensions. Agricultural prices are down just 1 percent, as
trade-related declines in soybean and cotton prices have been largely offset by
rising corn and wheat prices stemming from heavy rains that have reduced
expected U.S. supply.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
In recent weeks, many of the incoming signals on economic activity have been on
the softer side, and sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated. New information for
the second quarter implied weaker-than-expected business investment that was largely
offset by stronger-than-expected consumer spending, leaving second-quarter growth at
anticipated breach date, when the federal government will no longer be able to meet its financial
obligations, is expected to occur between late August and the end of November. We assume that
policymakers will raise the statutory federal debt limit before this breach date.

1.8 percent, down only slightly from our April projection. Looking forward to the rest of t l
u
O
the year, however, we expect the weakness in the business sector to persist and gains in
&
consumer spending to step down from their second-quarter rate. Furthermore, we e l
v
e
anticipate that the pace of inventory accumulation will slow over the rest of the year D

 Business fixed investment (BFI) is the most important contributor to the lower
outlook for GDP growth in this projection. After increasing 7 percent in
2018, BFI rose at just a 3 percent pace in the first quarter and is expected to
edge down, on net, through the end of this year, a markedly slower path than
in the April Tealbook. The new path reflects disappointing data on orders,
shipments, and imports of nondefense capital goods, as well as more
downbeat business surveys and a sharp deterioration in analysts’ expectations
of firms’ longer-term profit growth. The increase in tariffs on imports from
China should push up the relative price of capital goods and the user cost of
capital, but the negative effect on overall business investment is expected to
be minimal this year. In contrast, we assume that the grounding of Boeing’s
737 MAX aircraft will exert a more pronounced restraint (particularly in the
third quarter). As for investment in structures, we expect weakness in drilling
and mining to weigh on growth this year, consistent with our assumed path for
oil prices.
 After having declined in 2018, residential investment is projected to contract
further in the first half of 2019 before increasing in the second half. Recent
signals from the housing sector have been choppy and somewhat mixed.
Single-family permits declined through April, but home sales have trended
higher and builders’ sentiment has improved, likely reflecting the more than
1 percentage point decline in mortgage rates from last fall’s peak. We expect
5 We assume that the grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft will hold down GDP growth by
less than 0.1 percentage point this year and will boost growth next year by the same amount. (Although the
overall effect on GDP is small, there are noticeable effects on some components of spending.)
6 It is worth noting that GDI has been notably weaker than GDP. Over the past four quarters, GDI
rose only 1.9 percent, more than 1 percentage point less than GDP. Any difference between these figures
reflects measurement error in the two indicators.

from the modest gain projected in the April Tealbook. Although lower output
o
D
for motor vehicles and aircraft has been an important source of weakness, the
recent declines for manufacturing have been broadly based. Measures of new
orders from the national and regional surveys of manufacturers have also
turned down recently and suggest that output will remain soft in the coming
months.
 In contrast to the weakness in other segments of the economy, consumer
spending has picked up since earlier in the year, and the most recent readings
for retail sales and motor vehicle sales have surprised us to the upside.7
Looking ahead, we project that favorable sentiment and expected gains in
labor income should continue to support spending, although our projection is
tempered somewhat in response to a downward revision to personal income
data for the fourth quarter of last year. All told, we expect PCE to increase
about 3 percent in the second quarter and a little under 2½ percent in the
second half of the year.
 Net exports are expected to provide a small boost to GDP growth over the first
half, in part because imports have been restrained relative to fundamentals. In
the first quarter, net exports added 1 percentage point to GDP growth, about
0.4 percentage point more than expected in the April Tealbook, as exports
surprised to the upside. In April, imports fell, with large declines for capital
and consumer goods categories, and we now expect that net exports will
7 A preliminary, and noisy, measure of consumer spending using credit and debit card transactions
provided by First Data fell back sharply in May. We are still gaining experience with these data, which can
revise substantially; moreover, the May reading was driven by unusually large declines in a few spending
categories, raising the possibility of underlying data-quality issues. Thus, we have for now taken only a
little signal from this drop and continue to estimate that retail spending rose modestly last month. We will
have a better read on May retail sales with the Census Bureau’s official data release on June 14, after the
Tealbook has closed but before the June FOMC meeting.

 We project that the contribution of government purchases to real GDP growth
o
D
will step down from 0.6 percentage point in the first half of the year to
0.2 percentage point in the second half. This contour largely reflects a surge
in infrastructure investment by state and local governments in the first four
months of the year that is expected to partially unwind over the remainder of
the year.
After having advanced 3 percent last year, GDP is projected to grow 2 percent
this year and next before stepping down to 1¾ percent in 2021; this gradual deceleration
in GDP reflects both the lagged effects of past removal of monetary accommodation and
the waning effects of fiscal policy impetus. This outlook for growth is lower than in the
April Tealbook, as we expect the negative effects from concerns about trade policy and
the global outlook to diminish only gradually.
 On average, GDP growth is projected to run in line with potential after this
year, leaving the output gap fairly flat over this period. By the end of 2021,
GDP exceeds its potential level by 2 percent—about ½ percentage point less
than in the April Tealbook but still indicative of a very tight economy.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
The labor market has continued to tighten so far this year but at a slower pace
than last year. Job gains have been solid, on average, the unemployment rate has moved
lower, and the employment-to-population ratio has been unchanged, on net, from late last
year.
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 224,000 in April and 75,000 last month. On
average, these readings are a little lower than what we expected in the April
Tealbook but still well above the gains (85,000 to 115,000) that we estimate

are needed to keep labor utilization constant.8 Over the first five months of t l

O
the year, payroll gains averaged 164,000 per month, down substantially from
&
their strong pace in 2018. Given the projected slowing in aggregate demand e l

m
microdata from the payroll-processing firm ADP has also decelerated
o
D
markedly relative to its pace last year and showed a sharp step-down from
April to May.
o Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained near historically
low levels, contributing to our decision to take only limited signal for our
near-term outlook from the weak employment gain in May.
 The unemployment rate moved down to 3.6 percent in April and May from
3.9 percent in the first quarter. The LFPR also declined, from 63.1 percent in
the first quarter to 62.8 percent in April and May. Combining the signal from
these measures, the employment-to-population ratio ticked down to
60.6 percent, and we expect it to hold steady through the third quarter,
0.1 percentage point less than we had expected in the April Tealbook. The
unemployment rate is expected to edge up to 3.7 percent next quarter.
In the medium term, we expect the labor market to remain tight. However, in
contrast with recent Tealbooks, we expect essentially no further tightening from the
middle of this year through the end of 2021. This less robust outlook for the labor market
reflects the downward revisions to output growth.
 Average monthly total job gains slow over the projection, from about
160,000 per month this year to about 140,000 in 2020 and 100,000 in 2021.9
Payrolls are projected to expand about 10,000 per month more slowly over the
medium term than in the April Tealbook.
8 This range assumes that the LFPR declines in line with the staff’s estimate of its trend. With an
unchanged participation rate, the pace of monthly job gains required to keep the unemployment rate
constant ranges from 115,000 to 145,000.
9 The payroll forecast is boosted in the first part of 2020, but not for the year as a whole, by the
government’s hiring of temporary census workers.

 Business-sector productivity rose 2.4 percent over the four quarters ending in D
the first quarter of this year, well above the pace we expected in the April
Tealbook. However, we have taken little signal from this strong reading, in
part because some of the strength reflects reported declines in a volatile
component of business-sector hours, and also because even these annual
figures can be quite erratic. We project productivity growth to slow to around
1¼ percent per year for the rest of the medium term. One of the alternative
simulations in the Risks and Uncertainty section explores the implications of a
stronger underlying productivity trend (together with a lower natural rate of
unemployment and a higher LFPR trend) than we have assumed.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
After surprisingly soft monthly readings earlier in the year, core PCE prices
posted a larger gain in April, and we continue to expect the 12-month change in core PCE
prices to move back up over the second half of this year and to be 1.8 percent for 2019 as
a whole. Looking further ahead, we continue to project core PCE inflation to edge up to
1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, a bit above our estimate of underlying inflation, as the
boost from a tight labor market is only partly offset by subdued import price inflation.
We project headline PCE inflation to be below core inflation this year but to move in line
with core for the rest of the medium term, reflecting increases in food prices and a
lessening of the projected downward pull of oil prices on consumer energy prices.
 Since the beginning of the year, core PCE inflation has been held down by
unusually weak readings for a few categories. However, the pace of monthly
increases picked up in April to 0.2 percent (from an average pace of less than
0.1 percent in the first quarter), and we expect this higher pace to continue
through the near term. In addition, the imprint from last year’s exceptionally
low August reading will soon drop out of the 12-month window. As a result,

 We expect that the tariffs on imports from China implemented in May will
boost effective import prices this year, but the upward revision to the path of
the dollar and lower commodity prices should provide a partial offset.10 On
net, we have revised up our projection of 2019 effective import price inflation
from 0.9 percent in the previous Tealbook to a moderate 1.5 percent currently.
 Total PCE prices rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and we
expect this measure of inflation to remain close to this pace through
September as recent declines in crude oil prices feed through to lower
consumer energy prices.
o We expect consumer food prices to partially offset these energy price
movements. The 12-month change in food prices was only 0.8 percent in
April, but, consistent with the rise in futures prices for some farm
commodities, we expect the change in consumer food prices to increase to
around 2 percent by the end of the third quarter.
 The most recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations suggest that these expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
Although TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation have
decreased further since the April Tealbook, we attribute much of this
movement to a narrowing in risk premiums rather than to a decline in inflation
expectations.
10 Published import price indexes exclude tariffs. However, tariffs add to the prices that
purchasers of imports actually pay—that is, effective import prices.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will remain at
4.6 percent. We also still assume that potential output growth will slow after
2021 to 1.7 percent per year in the longer run, as the boost to potential growth
from the 2017 tax cuts wanes.
 We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equilibrium federal
funds rate will be 0.5 percent. The nominal yield on 10-year Treasury
securities is 3.4 percent in the longer run.

 GDP growth slows from 1.7 percent in 2021 to 1.4 percent in 2024, as the
contribution from fiscal policy impetus fades. The unemployment rate moves
up gradually from 3.7 percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural
rate in subsequent years. PCE price inflation moves up from 1.9 percent in
2021 to 2.0 percent at the end of 2024.
 Given the outlook for inflation and resource utilization, the nominal federal
funds rate remains a little below 2.7 percent from the end of the medium term
to the end of 2024, and it declines slowly to its long-run value of 2.5 percent
thereafter.

O Using New Microdata to Measure Wages and Labor Compensation
&
l
e The staff closely monitors a variety of measures of labor compensation, each of which has relative
v
e advantages in terms of timeliness and comprehensiveness. Although these measures tend to
D
n move in a broadly similar manner over long horizons, they often send different signals over shorter
o
c periods. To sharpen our understanding of labor compensation growth, we have been working with
E
microdata from the payroll-processing company ADP to create alternative measures of
c
ti compensation growth that can complement the official statistics.1
s
e
m
o The ADP payroll data include linked employer–employee records from firms that hire ADP to
D
manage their payrolls. The ADP data cover roughly 20 percent of private-sector jobs.2 The records
include information for each worker on earnings, pay rates, hours worked, other components of
total compensation (such as bonuses), and some demographic, industry, and geographic
information. Federal Reserve staff typically have access to the data within 10 days of the month’s
end, comparable to the release schedule of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment
Situation report. The ADP data provide a unique combination of accuracy, detail, timeliness,
and coverage.3
In this discussion we focus on two measures of compensation derived from the ADP payroll
microdata. First, we create a broad measure of compensation per hour (ADP-CPH), in which
compensation is defined as base pay (the contractual hourly wage or per-pay-period salary) plus
tips, commissions, and bonuses. The inclusion of bonuses makes it somewhat comparable to the
broad BLS-CPH measure from the productivity and costs release. That said, our measure does not
cover other benefits.4 Second, we build a measure similar to the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker
(WGT) by following the same workers for 12 months and calculating the median year-over-year
change in individuals’ hourly wages.
The ADP-CPH and BLS-CPH measures (shown in panel A of figure 1) tended to track each other
relatively well until the surprisingly low BLS-CPH readings in 2016. This divergence is at least in part
due to sharp declines in the growth of employers’ insurance and retirement contributions in that
year, which are not captured in our ADP measure. Since 2011, both measures of CPH rose about
2½ percent per year; both measures show some acceleration since 2017, with the BLS-CPH measure
averaging a little under 3 percent and the ADP-CPH measure averaging a little above 3 percent.
Importantly, the ADP wage microdata are considerably more timely than BLS-CPH, which is
available about one month after the end of the quarter and continues to revise substantially for
1 The ADP confidential worker-level data are protected by strict technical protocols governing access to the
microdata, and tabulated data are released only after a disclosure review process.
2 Only firms that hire ADP are included in the data, which may produce a sample that is not representative of
the U.S. workforce. However, as with the ADP employment measures we have been reporting for over a year, we
attempt to make our series more representative by weighting the microdata by firm size and industry.
3 The measures introduced in this discussion are based on data for roughly 20 million workers for quarterly
changes and 11 million workers for the matched year-over-year growth rates.
4 The BLS-CPH measure includes employer-provided benefits, such as contributions to health insurance and
retirement plans, which we have found difficult to account for in the ADP data. We are in the process of building a
series comparable to the BLS measure of average hourly earnings, which is a narrower measure that does not
include benefits or bonuses.

up to half a year after the end of the quarter.5 The timely and comprehensive nature of the ADP-
CPH series would have been particularly useful at the end of 2012, for example, when employers
pulled forward bonus pay because of the anticipated increase in 2013 income tax rates. The initial
releases of BLS-CPH for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 did not reflect any
timing change in compensation (the blue bars in panel B of figure 1). It was only several months
later, in mid-2013, that revisions showed BLS-CPH growth had surged in 2012:Q4 before falling in
2013:Q1 (the green bars). In contrast, the ADP-CPH measure revealed the shift in bonuses in near
real time (the red bars).
Measures of average compensation, like BLS-CPH and BLS Average Hourly Earnings (AHE), have
some disadvantages: They can be influenced by changes in the composition of employment, and
they give more weight to high earners. A more direct measure of wage pressure may be the
change in wages paid to the same workers, the approach taken by the WGT published by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In figure 2 we plot median wage changes from the ADP payroll
microdata and the WGT. ADP hourly wages (including tips and commissions)—the red line—have
tracked the WGT series reasonably well in recent years, though there is a gap earlier in the sample.
Median individual growth in base pay—the dashed blue line in figure 2—appears to be remarkably
5 That is, until tabulations from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages are available to measure the
near-totality of U.S. payrolls. In the initial releases, BLS-CPH is estimated using limited information from BLS-AHE
and various measures of hours.

O stable and smooth, and it runs somewhat below median ADP hourly wage growth. The gap
& between the ADP series and the WGT may reflect a number of factors, including topcoding in the
e l Current Population Survey (CPS, the source data for the WGT), measurement error, and differences
v
e in earnings and hours definitions between the source data.6
D
n
o In fact, the ADP data provide us with direct evidence of measurement error in the individual-level
c
E
CPS reports, though it is unclear how much it contributes to the differences between the ADP- and
c
ti CPS-based time series. Figure 3 shows part of the distribution of 12-month wage changes for a
s
e representative month. The ADP distribution is heavily bunched around round numbers,
m
o corresponding to raises of 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 percent per year. In contrast, the CPS distribution is more
D
diffuse and shows almost no bunching.7 We take this dispersion as an indication of measurement
error in the CPS responses: Many workers receive round-number raises, but CPS wage changes are
calculated from respondent-reported earnings and hours levels, so small reporting errors may
obscure the pattern of round-number raises in the CPS.8
The results of the staff’s analysis of this new source of compensation data are encouraging, and we
are hopeful that these data will improve our understanding of the conditions faced by U.S.
workers. Importantly, the data confirm the gradual step-up in compensation growth seen in both
the BLS series and the WGT over the past several years. Nonetheless, the work is preliminary.
Constructing measures of compensation that can be compared to official statistics is daunting,
partly because the complexity of compensation makes it difficult to construct equivalent measures.
Looking forward, the richness of the ADP data provides many further avenues to explore, such as
creating a measure of average hourly earnings and further analyzing the importance of bunching in
wage changes.
Figure 3: Distribution of Wage Changes (March 2015)
6 In the CPS, households with earnings above $150,000 per year are shown as earning $150,000 (topcoding) so
that any changes in those households’ earnings will not be visible. In addition, earnings are self-reported, leaving
room for considerable reporting error. Moreover, the ADP measures have a substantially larger sample size and
include workers who change residence, so long as ADP continues to process their payrolls.
7 The bunching in figure 3 helps explain some features of figure 2. When the median of a series is at a bunching
point, moderate changes in the distribution will cause little or no change in the median. Thus, median ADP base pay
hovers at 3 percent (a bunching point) for years, while the CPS series is volatile over the same window.
8 This reasoning is also consistent with the higher cross-sectional variance in CPS wage growth as well as
results in the academic literature emphasizing survey response error in questions about income and hours.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Our optimism about growth abroad in the April Tealbook—guarded though it
was—has been undermined by several factors: data flow that, on the whole, has been
disappointing; an abrupt escalation of trade tensions; a markdown to U.S. growth; and the
resurgence of other risks (Brexit, Italy). These developments have roiled markets,
increased uncertainty, and dimmed the growth outlook for foreign economies.
At the time of the April Tealbook, we had received some encouraging data from
k
China and the euro area. We had hoped to find confirmation in subsequent data that o
o
l
global growth was firming. However, recent data have disappointed on balance. April u t
O
data for China were downbeat, and the recovery from last year’s growth slowdown now &
l
e
seems more tentative, raising questions about prospects for emerging Asia. In Latin v
e
D
America, Mexico and Brazil continued to languish, surprising us with first-quarter
n
o
contractions. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), weaker-than-expected c
E
Canadian GDP growth in the first quarter offset stronger-than-expected growth ’ l
t
n
I
elsewhere. Indicators for the current quarter suggest that the expected pickup in
Canadian growth is in train, but growth in other AFEs is slowing.
We expect foreign growth to improve somewhat, to an annual rate of 2.2 percent
this quarter, from a substantially below-potential rate of 1.6 percent in the first. Our
conviction around this pickup is not strong, however, as it comes mainly from a rebound
in Latin America. Beyond the current quarter, we have total foreign growth edging up
further as growth rises a bit more in the emerging market economies (EMEs), while AFE
growth stabilizes around potential. We expect the Latin American recovery to gain
traction, and emerging Asia ex-China should benefit from an upswing in the high-tech
cycle, of which we are beginning to see some tentative signs (see the box “Accounting
for the Asian Tech Cycle”).
Relative to the previous Tealbook, we revised down foreign GDP growth in the
first half on weaker-than-expected data from the EMEs described above. Further out, we
revised down our forecast a touch, given the markdown in U.S. growth and the recent
escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China and Mexico, which led
to an increase in implemented tariffs and exacerbated policy uncertainty.

Accounting for the Asian Tech Cycle
Global trade weakened markedly at the end of 2018, with particular weakness in the emerging
market economies (EMEs). EME exports contracted almost 7 percent at an annual rate in the
fourth quarter and a further 3½ percent in the first quarter of this year. Emerging Asia’s tech
sector has been especially weak, with production and export of high-tech products falling
substantially in recent quarters. These developments raise the question of whether the tech
slowdown has been a driver of the broader slowdown in global trade, perhaps due to supply-side
factors such as the timing of new product releases, or whether the tech slowdown merely reflects
either a broader slowdown in global demand or the effects of recent tariff hikes and trade
tensions. This discussion argues that slowing Chinese domestic demand, more than supply-side
developments or tariffs, was the primary driver of recent developments in the Asian tech sector.
k
o
o Highly integrated global supply chains for consumer electronics have created a correlated pattern
l
t
u of production and trade in electronics and software across economies, particularly in emerging
O
Asia, now commonly referred to as the tech cycle. The tech cycle is increasingly dictated by
&
smartphones, for which sales have generally eclipsed those of other tech products: Global
l
e
v smartphone sales were about 1.4 billion units in 2018, compared to 260 million units for personal
e
D computers. This trend is reflected in regional trade patterns, with about half of Asian
n
semiconductor exports now directed to China, the final assembler of most mobile phones.
o
E
c
’ l Technological advances in the semiconductor industry are often viewed as the fundamental
t
n
I driver of the tech cycle. The high rate of obsolescence for new chips leads to relatively short
product life cycles for high-end electronics. Upturns in the tech cycle may therefore reflect the
production and export of components associated with new product releases, which are
prompted by innovations in semiconductor and circuit technology.
We first examine the historical relationship between product releases and high-tech data.
Specifically, we run country-level regressions of semiconductor inventories, high-tech production,
and high-tech exports on smartphone release date indicators, controlling for trend growth and
lunar New Year effects. We find that release dates can help explain the inventory cycle in
semiconductors. However, new releases have little explanatory power for trade and production.1
1 This exercise closely follows Benjamin Carton, Joannes Mongardini, and Yiqun Li (2018), “A New
Smartphone for Every Fifth Person on Earth: Quantifying the New Tech Cycle,” IMF Working Paper No. 18/22
(Washington: International Monetary Fund, January 24). However, their paper uses non-seasonally adjusted data
as dependent variables. While we believe this approach has merits, there are likely seasonal factors influencing
these data beyond smartphone releases; hence, we use seasonally adjusted data.

What about developments over the past year? Semiconductor inventories continued to grow in
2018 (the blue line in figure 1), and the previous analysis suggests that product releases in late
2018 and early 2019 could partially explain this trend. In spite of new releases, however, phone
production has remained weak. Figure 2 shows that Chinese phone production (the black line)
has been in decline since 2017. This contraction, amid still-robust semiconductor output in
emerging Asia, including Korea and Singapore (the red and blue lines, respectively), helped drive
the run-up in inventories and depressed semiconductor prices (the black line in figure 1), which
subsequently weighed on trade through 2018.
What accounts for the weakness of phone production since 2017? The most notable factor is a
broad-based slowdown in Chinese demand, likely reflecting in part the authorities’ financial
deleveraging campaign. As can be seen in figure 3, beginning in 2017, Chinese domestic
consumption slowed for mobile phones, household durables, and autos, with purchases of
k
phones showing particular weakness toward the end of last year. With China accounting for o
o
about one-third of global smartphone consumption, this falloff in demand has been sufficient to
l
t
drive the downturn in the regional supply chain. u
O
&
What are the prospects for a recovery in the high-tech industry in 2019? Data received since the l
e
v
April Tealbook show some signs of the tech sector stabilizing. Chinese mobile phone production e
D
picked up in April for the third successive month. Likely supported by this strengthening in
n
demand, Singapore’s tech exports stepped up in April, and Korean semiconductor exports this o
c
quarter are up through May. More generally, after a contraction in high-tech industrial E
l
production across emerging Asia in March, data for April have thus far been promising, with t ’
n
rebounds in Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. I
Semiconductor equity prices provide a useful forward-looking indicator of global electronics
trade. We construct a tech equities indicator by extracting common variation from the stock
prices of 133 firms in the semiconductor industry globally. As can be seen in figure 4, changes in
our headline indicator track global semiconductor shipments growth quite closely.
Our tech indicator suggests that investor sentiment bottomed out at the turn of the year.
Expectations of recovery are likely driven by a more optimistic growth outlook in China and the
rollout of 5G networks globally, which should accelerate product releases in 2019 and 2020.
However, heightened U.S.–Chinese trade tensions, including U.S. restrictions on business with
Huawei, drove semiconductor equities down in May and remain the most prominent downside
risks to a recovery in the industry.

Of course, trade policy developments have proved fluid and unpredictable. In our
baseline forecast, we are assuming the United States and China reach a “ceasefire” in
which tariffs are neither rolled back nor increased. For now, we are also assuming no
imposition of tariffs on Mexico, although that could well change by June 10, when the
Administration may implement the first 5 percent tariff hike on imports from that
country. However, it is possible that trade tensions could subside if a U.S.–China trade
deal, perhaps as early as at the G-20 Leaders’ Summit later this month, rolls back earlier
tariff hikes. Conversely, escalation is also quite possible, with the United States
imposing tariffs on the remainder of its imports from China and proceeding with a series
of tariff hikes on Mexico, prompting retaliation. We explore both these scenarios in the
k
o
o Risks and Uncertainty section.
l
t
u
O
& Some other key downside risks have also reemerged. The most prominent are the
l
e increased probability of a “no deal” Brexit and renewed concerns about the sustainability
v
e
D of Italy’s public debt. And, as mentioned above, our confidence in a Latin American
n
o
c recovery is not high, given repeated disappointment over the past few years.
E
l

t

I Against this global backdrop of modest growth and elevated policy uncertainty,
foreign inflation remained moderate, and we anticipate it will remain so throughout the
forecast horizon. Among the AFEs, the latest readings of 12-month core inflation were
below 1 percent in both the euro area and Japan. As such, we expect monetary policies in
these countries to remain highly accommodative, and we now assume the European
Central Bank (ECB) will wait until early 2021 to start lifting its policy rate, two quarters
later than previously anticipated. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its policy rate in
response to below-target inflation and weak economic growth. Several EME central
banks—including those in India, Malaysia, and the Philippines—also reduced their
interest rates, citing subdued underlying inflation, slowing growth, and heightened
downside risks in the global economy.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Euro Area. Following lackluster growth of only 0.8 percent in the second half of
2018, real GDP rebounded 1.6 percent in the first quarter, 0.2 percentage point higher
than our April Tealbook forecast. However, the rebound likely reflects the unwinding
of some temporary headwinds from last year, and indicators through May, such as
PMIs, continue to indicate weak underlying momentum, particularly in
manufacturing. Accordingly, we expect GDP growth to slow to a subdued
Page 42 of 136

--- Page 46 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 7, 2019
1.2 percent in the second quarter and stay around 1 percent the rest of this year.
Growth should then gradually increase to 1.7 percent in 2021, supported by still-
accommodative monetary policy. We revised down a touch our forecast for 2020
because of the recent increase in global trade tensions, the markdown to U.S. and
global growth, and renewed concerns over Italian fiscal policy. The fiscal outlook for
Italy worsened, as key members of the Italian government called for new fiscal
stimulus even as the European Commission officially reprimanded Italy for breaching
EU budgetary rules.
Core inflation came in at 0.8 percent in May on a 12-month basis. We expect
k
headline inflation to be held down in the near term by the recent fall in oil prices, o
o
l
before edging up to 1.3 percent by 2021, as economic slack diminishes. In line with t
u
O
this low-inflation environment, at its June 6 meeting, the ECB said that it expected to
&
l
hold policy rates steady at least through the first half of 2020. We now assume that e

the ECB will not start raising its deposit rate, currently at negative 0.4 percent, until D
n
the first quarter of 2021, reaching 0 percent by late 2021, and will continue o
c
E
reinvesting maturing assets well after that. The ECB also announced details of the ’ l
t
n
new quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations program, which will have a I
maturity of two years and entail an interest rate as low as 10 basis points above the
ECB deposit rate.
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth picked up from 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter
to 2 percent in the first, 0.5 percentage point higher than our April Tealbook forecast.
Economic activity was supported by robust domestic demand, largely due to
stockpiling by households and businesses ahead of the original Brexit date. As this
boost unwinds, we forecast growth in the second quarter to slow to 0.7 percent. Even
so, this projection is slightly higher than our previous forecast, largely because of
positive surprises in services PMIs, which point to stronger-than-expected domestic
demand.
Brexit-related uncertainty has increased again, following the resignation of Prime
Minister May, who could be replaced by a new Conservative Party leader that favors
a no-deal Brexit. As such, we project that growth in the second half of this year will
stay subdued, at 1.2 percent, with uncertainty weighing on economic activity. Further
out, we assume in our baseline forecast a non-disruptive resolution of Brexit, with
uncertainty noticeably reduced by the end of the year (either by ratifying a Brexit
deal, providing yet another extension, or canceling the Brexit process). Growth

should then pick up to 1.6 percent next year, close to its potential rate. That said, in
our view, recent political developments put the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit at
an all-time high.
 Canada. GDP growth in the first quarter remained low at 0.4 percent, 0.6 percentage
point weaker than estimated in the April Tealbook, because of shutdowns in oil
production and harsh winter weather. Recent indicators such as monthly GDP for
March and employment for April are upbeat and consistent with a growth pickup to
2.1 percent this quarter. We then expect GDP growth to settle at a near-potential pace
of around 1.7 percent. Relative to the April Tealbook, the medium-term outlook is
k
o somewhat weaker because of the lower path for oil prices and the markdown to U.S.
o
t l growth.
u
O
&
l We expect headline inflation to settle at the current pace of core inflation of 2 percent
e
v
e by late 2019. The Bank of Canada (BOC) kept its policy rate unchanged at
D
n 1.75 percent in its May 29 meeting. Given the weaker economic outlook, we now
o
c
E expect that the BOC will wait until late 2020 to resume gradually tightening its policy
l
’
t
n stance, two quarters later than previously assumed.
I
 Japan. Real GDP expanded 2.1 percent in the first quarter, well above our April
Tealbook forecast of 0.3 percent. That said, private consumption and exports both
declined, and the positive GDP growth mainly reflected plummeting imports. Recent
indicators have been mixed and, on net, suggest real GDP will stagnate this quarter.
Looking through the volatility from the consumption tax hike scheduled for late 2019,
we expect GDP to barely edge up in the second half of the year. Over the remainder
of the forecast period, we expect GDP growth to be slightly above its potential pace
of 0.7 percent, supported by additional spending related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
and very accommodative monetary policy.
The 12-month changes in total and core CPI picked up to 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent,
respectively, in April. Given the recent decline in oil prices and the yen appreciation,
we expect inflation to slow a bit over the near term, but then we expect it to edge up
to around 1 percent by the end of 2020. With inflation still far lower than the Bank of
Japan’s (BOJ) 2 percent target, we expect the BOJ to keep its deposit rate at negative
0.1 percent throughout the forecast period, while continued asset purchases should
keep the 10-year sovereign yield around the current target of zero percent.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. After rebounding to a brisk 7.3 percent in the first quarter following a broad-
based slowdown last year, China’s GDP growth is expected to step down to
6.1 percent in the current quarter, 0.5 percentage point lower than in the previous
forecast. April’s activity indicators disappointed, with industrial production
contracting sharply and retail sales growing at the slowest pace in more than a
decade. The extent of the softening suggests that some key areas of the Chinese
economy continue to struggle to gain a solid footing.
We expect the escalation of the trade conflict with the United States since early May k
o
o
to weigh further on China’s growth outlook, both through direct effects of higher
l
t
u
tariffs on China’s exports and through indirect effects from prolonged uncertainty O
&
weighing on investment. Indeed, recent data on manufacturing investment, l
e
v
particularly for machinery and equipment, have weakened notably. That said, we e
D
expect policy stimulus to partly offset the drag from heightened trade policy n
o
c
uncertainty. All told, we see growth holding relatively steady at around 6 percent for E
l
’
t
the rest of the year before falling to 5.7 percent next year, in line with declining n
I
potential growth. Compared with the April Tealbook, our forecast is down an
average of 0.2 percentage point over the forecast period.
 Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth slowed a touch to a subpar 2.6 percent in
the first quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of below-trend growth. On balance,
growth was in line with our April forecast; a surprising contraction in Korea and a
slowdown in India were offset by stronger-than-expected growth in Hong Kong.
Available data on PMIs, industrial production, and exports for the second quarter
suggest that manufacturing, though weaker than expected, is stabilizing. We expect
this improvement, together with support from fiscal policy in some countries, to boost
growth to 3.1 percent in the current quarter and to 3.5 percent in the second half of
the year. Our forecast is down a touch from that in April, reflecting the weaker-than-
expected incoming data and spillovers from lower growth in China.
 Mexico. After stagnating in the fourth quarter, real GDP contracted 0.7 percent in the
first. Household consumption remained weak, and external demand appears to have
been a drag, with weakness in U.S. manufacturing weighing on Mexican exports and
export-oriented services. However, some of the weakness in the export sector
reflected disruptions from labor unrest that have faded, contributing to a rise in
Page 45 of 136

--- Page 49 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 7, 2019
manufacturing exports in April. As such, we see growth turning positive in the
current quarter. That said, a downward revision to U.S. manufacturing output and
increased uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy toward Mexico led us to revise
down the outlook. We now see growth limping along at below 2 percent for the rest
of this year and then rising to 2.5 percent by the end of next year. Moreover, the
possibility of a further escalation in trade tensions has greatly increased the downside
risks to the outlook.
Downplaying the recent weak pace of growth, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) left its
policy rate unchanged at 8.25 percent at its May meeting. Although headline
k inflation dropped sharply in the first quarter as a result of the fall in energy prices, the
o
o
t l BOM expressed concerns that wage inflation has been high and that core inflation has
u
O
been persistently above the 3 percent inflation target.
&
l
e
v
e  Brazil. Brazil’s sluggish climb out of its deepest recession on record faltered yet
D
n again in the first quarter, with the economy contracting 0.6 percent after barely eking
o
c
E out positive growth in the fourth quarter. Some of the weakness is the result of
l
’
t
n temporary disruptions related to a large dam disaster, and we expect growth to pick
I
up some in the current quarter but remain weak at 1.2 percent. Plummeting demand
from neighboring Argentina and a deterioration in confidence and survey indicators,
amid delays in an important pension reform, point to a slower recovery than we
anticipated. We now have growth reaching only 2.5 percent by the second half of
next year, 0.2 percentage point below that in the April Tealbook.

Financial Market Developments
Outside of this box, the Financial Market Developments section of the Tealbook is
based on information that was available by 5:00 p.m. EDT on June 6. On June 7, at
8:30 a.m. EDT, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Employment Situation
Report for May 2019. The release was reportedly interpreted by market participants
as weaker than expected. Nominal yields were down 9 basis points and 5 basis points
at the 2- and 10-year maturities, respectively, in the first 30 minutes of trading
subsequent to the release. Equity index futures were little changed on net.
Negative news about international trade tensions and, to a lesser extent, soft U.S.
and foreign economic data increased investors’ concerns about downside risks to the
economic outlook and weighed on financial markets over the intermeeting period.
Nominal Treasury yields posted very large declines, and the expected path of policy—
whether adjusted for term premiums or not—shifted down considerably over the period.
Investors now appear to be putting substantial weight on a policy easing by as early as the
July meeting. Equity prices declined, on net, and corporate bond spreads widened
appreciably.
 Nominal Treasury yields fell 37 basis points at both 2- and 10-year maturities.

 A straight read of OIS forward rates suggests that investors expect the federal FFii
funds rate to decrease about 60 basis points by the end of this year and an
additional 30 basis points in 2020. A staff model that adjusts for term
premiums indicates a 30 basis point decline in the rate by year-end 2019 and a
modest additional decline next year. Both the adjusted and unadjusted paths
shifted down considerably over the intermeeting period.
 On net over the period, the S&P 500 index decreased 3.5 percent. Stock
prices declined notably through the end of May but subsequently rose
somewhat, reflecting in part FOMC communications that were perceived to
increase the likelihood of a near-term policy easing. Option-implied volatility

on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—increased, though it remained well below
levels reached in December. Investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond
spreads widened 20 basis points and 47 basis points, respectively.
 Foreign equity prices and sovereign yields in the advanced foreign economies
(AFEs) decreased markedly over the intermeeting period. The broad dollar
index rose, with notable appreciation of the dollar against the Chinese
renminbi and Mexican peso.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
The large declines in nominal Treasury yields over the intermeeting period were
driven primarily by negative headlines about trade tensions between the United States
and two major trading partners, China and Mexico.1 Softer-than-expected domestic
economic news also contributed to the declines. A relatively weak preliminary May U.S.
Markit PMI release appeared to have had an unusually large negative effect on yields in
late May, reportedly because it was interpreted as indicating that trade developments had
begun to affect macroeconomic outcomes. Nominal yields also dropped in response to
weaker-than-expected ADP employment data.
FOMC communications had little net effect on yields. Yields rose modestly
following the Chair’s May FOMC press conference comments about inflation but, later in
s
the period, moved down on FOMC participants’ remarks that reportedly were seen as t
e
k
signaling an increased likelihood of near-term policy easing. Five-year and 5-to-10-year r

which was about flat for the next two years at the beginning of the period, currently

Revision to the Staff’s Term‐Premium‐Adjusted Policy Rate Path
Forward rate curves fitted to overnight index swap (OIS) rates have often been used as a
measure of the market’s expected path of the policy rate. Most recently, such a “straight read”
based on OIS (the blue lines in figure 1) implies expected federal funds rates of 1.81 percent for
year‐end 2019 and 1.43 percent for year‐end 2020. These numbers stand in contrast to recent
Blue Chip survey forecasts (the yellow diamonds in figure 1), which are relatively flat over the next
several years. The gap between OIS forward rates and survey forecasts suggests the possibility
of negative term premiums in OIS markets.
The staff employs a variety of tools to gauge the magnitude of these premiums. The measure
used in previous Tealbooks to construct a term‐premium‐adjusted policy rate path came from a
shadow rate term structure model estimated with historical OIS rates and Blue Chip survey
forecasts (the red lines in figure 1).1 The model produces results consistent with an effective
lower bound on OIS rates by specifying a “shadow federal funds rate” that is permitted to move
freely and allowed to turn negative; the model‐implied federal funds rate is equal to the shadow
rate when the shadow rate is above the lower bound and is constrained at the lower bound
otherwise. The previous version of this model had been estimated on a sample beginning in 1991
and ending in 2016.2
Consistent with the state of the art in academic research and data limitations at the time, the
model was thus effectively premised on the assumption that the dynamics of the shadow rate as
well as the pricing of interest rate risks are described by the same set of model parameters before
and after the onset of the Global Financial Crisis. However, this assumption of structural stability
may be called into question for several reasons:
 Many macro models imply that the joint behavior of key macroeconomic variables
changes once the policy rate hits the effective lower bound, as conventional monetary
s
t policy can no longer respond to a changing macroeconomic outlook.
e
k
a r  It is not clear that the effects of the unconventional policy tools used by the Federal
M
Reserve are well described by the same shadow rate model parameters as those that
l
a
ci described the pre‐crisis years.
n
a  Long‐term trends as well as the fallout from the Great Recession may have caused lasting
n
Fi structural changes (such as a downshift in (cid:1870)∗). Indeed, recent staff research finds that
various formal statistical tests reject the hypothesis of structural stability of the shadow
rate model.3
1 A complementary measure based on a macro‐finance model was introduced in the box “A Macro‐Finance
Measure of Term Premiums in Federal Funds Futures Rates” in the Financial Markets section of the April 2019
Tealbook A.
2 The model is described in detail in Marcel A. Priebsch (2017), “A Shadow Rate Model of Intermediate‐Term
Policy Rate Expectations,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
October 4), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds‐notes/shadow‐rate‐model‐of‐intermediate‐term‐
policy‐rate‐expectations‐20171004.htm.

In a revised version of the staff’s shadow rate model, different sets of model parameters are used
to describe the period before December 2008 and the period after December 2008. In other
words, the revised shadow rate model has a structural break around the time of the onset of the
Global Financial Crisis. Consequently, the estimated parameters of the model that are relevant
for yield dynamics in recent years are based on a substantially shorter sample (December 2008 to
March 2019) than the previous model. In the staff’s best judgement, the benefit of the revised
model in terms of topicality now outweighs the greater estimation uncertainty associated with a
shorter sample period.4
The green lines in figure 1 show the implied path for the federal funds rate from the revised
model. The revised model suggests a substantially flatter federal funds rate path over the next
several years than the unadjusted path. In contrast, the previous model indicates further gradual
rate increases over the medium term. Put differently, the revised model currently implies less
negative term premiums compared with the previous model. Longer‐range expectations from
the revised model—that is, expectations for the average federal funds rate 5 to 10 years ahead—
have also been notably lower than those from the previous model in recent years (figure 2).
Nevertheless, the expectations implied by both models share certain qualitative features such as
the prominent increase in long‐term expectations after the U.S. presidential election in late 2016,
which was not mirrored in long‐range Blue Chip survey forecasts. That said, the revised model
better captures the preceding decline in long‐range survey forecasts in 2015 and 2016 and the
lower level of those forecasts seen since.
Going forward, the staff will show the term‐premium‐adjusted federal funds rate path based on
the revised model. In light of the still‐limited post‐2008 data, the staff will monitor the model’s
output closely and make further updates as judged appropriate.

horizons in its estimation.

Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey, conducted through May 24, continued to suggest a
flat policy path through the third quarter of 2020. Options prices (unadjusted for term
premiums) suggest that investors have attached better-than-even odds of a rate cut by the
July 2019 meeting.
Reflecting the sharper downward tilt of the unadjusted OIS-implied policy path,
the near-term forward spread on Treasury securities—defined as the difference between
the six-quarter-ahead forward rate and the three-month Treasury bill yield—has moved
down further since the May FOMC meeting and now stands at negative 58 basis points,
its lowest level since the beginning of 2008. The spread between 10-year and three-
month Treasury yields fell to negative 13 basis points, a level it last reached in early
2007. Both spreads are in the bottom decile of their respective distributions since 1971.3
The current low levels of these spreads suggest, in a reduced-form analysis, that the
probability that the United States will enter a recession over the next four quarters is
roughly 70 percent. To be sure, such probabilities should be interpreted with caution,
given the long sample periods over which the models are estimated and secular trends (in
particular, declining term premiums) that may materially affect predictions.4
The S&P 500 index fell 3.5 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period,
primarily in response to the escalation of trade tensions with China. Although stock price
declines were fairly broad based, firms with high China exposure and those in cyclical
sectors—such as energy, information technology, consumer discretionary, ss
tt
ee
communication services, and banks—posted particularly large losses. The announcement kk
rr
aa
MM
of possible additional tariffs on Mexican imports also contributed temporarily to stock
ll
aa
price declines, particularly for the automotive sector. Later in the period, stock prices ccii
nn
aa
regained some of their losses amid an easing of trade tensions with Mexico and nn
FFii
expectations of a more accommodative stance of policy. On net, one-month option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index (the VIX) increased to 16 percent, just below the
median of its historical range. During the period, the VIX moved as high as 21 percent
but remained well below the 36 percent peak reached in December 2018.
3 The near-term forward spread has been shown to be a bit more informative in terms of predicting
a transition to recession in the subsequent four quarters, compared with some popular measures such as the
spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields.
4 Model-based recession probability estimates, along with estimates derived from stochastic
simulations around the staff baseline forecast and the FRB/US model forecast, are also shown in the Risks
and Uncertainty section.

Spreads on investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds over
comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened 20 basis points and 47 basis points,
respectively. Even so, spreads on both types of corporate bonds are currently near the
midpoints of their respective historical ranges.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Global risky asset prices fell sharply and the prices of safe-haven assets increased
as risk sentiment turned decidedly negative over the intermeeting period. The ongoing
trade policy dispute between the United States and China, the prospect of additional
tariffs on imports from Mexico, and soft economic data weighed on investor confidence.
Developments in Europe, including an increase in the probability of a “no deal” Brexit, a
worsening of the fiscal situation in Italy, and stress in the euro-area banking sector, also
contributed to the decline in risk sentiment.
Equity indexes in AFEs and emerging market economies (EMEs) fell. Increased
trade uncertainty and trade restrictions placed on the Chinese technology sector had a
strong effect on Asian equity prices—the Hong Kong and Shanghai indexes fell
9.2 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively. Mexican equity prices fell 3.2 percent,
primarily on news regarding potential tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States.
Foreign equity price declines were accompanied by outflows from EME-dedicated funds,

year-forward euro-area inflation compensation declined 12 basis points to 1.29 percent,
close to its lowest level since mid-2016. Despite the risk-off sentiment, euro-area
peripheral bond spreads over German yields generally narrowed, and yields reached
record lows in Greece and Portugal. The notable exception was Italy, where spreads
widened 18 basis points as the country’s fiscal outlook worsened. Key members of the
Italian government called for additional fiscal stimulus measures, even while the
European Commission officially warned Italy that it was already in breach of European
Union budget rules.

The dollar generally appreciated against EME currencies and depreciated against
AFE currencies, leaving the broad dollar index 0.77 percent higher since the previous
FOMC meeting. Safe-haven flows contributed to the dollar’s depreciation against the
Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar rose 2.7 percent against the British pound
amid increased Brexit uncertainty. In the EMEs, the announcement of potential tariffs on
Mexican imports and the downgrade of Mexican sovereign debt weighed on the peso,
which depreciated 3.9 percent over the intermeeting period. The sizable 2.6 percent
decline of the Chinese renminbi against the dollar notably occurred as the PBOC was
leaning against the depreciation (see the box “Recent Depreciation of the Chinese

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS

Recent Depreciation of the Chinese Renminbi
The Chinese renminbi (RMB) has come under pressure since trade tensions escalated over
the past month. In this discussion, we review recent exchange rate moves and actions by
Chinese authorities to stabilize the currency, and we compare the current situation to
previous episodes of RMB weakness.
The RMB has fallen 2.5 percent against the U.S. dollar since trade tensions escalated in early
May, and the spot exchange rate is approaching the psychological barrier of 7 yuan per
dollar for the third time since its unexpected depreciation in August 2015 (figure 1). There
are signs of continued depreciation pressure, albeit modest, as the offshore RMB has
consistently been trading at a weaker level than the onshore RMB. In addition, investor
demand for protection against further RMB depreciation (relative to appreciation) as
measured by risk reversals spiked in recent weeks, though to still‐low levels (figure 2).
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has not engaged in direct sales of foreign reserves and
instead has used other measures to support the currency. In recent weeks, the PBOC has set
the daily central parity rate of the onshore RMB stronger than would have been expected
based on its de jure central parity fixing rule (figure 3).1 Market participants generally
interpret stronger‐than‐expected fixings as a signal that the PBOC prefers a stronger RMB.
Indeed, the recent fixing is remarkably stable at 6.9 (figure 4).

1 In early 2016, the PBOC detailed the rule for fixing the RMB’s daily central parity rate, which serves as
the midpoint for the intraday trading range of 2 percent, as the sum of the previous day’s market close of
the RMB to the dollar and the change that would offset overnight changes in a trade‐weighted basket of
currencies.

The PBOC has also attempted to discourage the shorting of the offshore RMB by selling
short‐term bills in Hong Kong to tighten offshore liquidity, as evidenced by a jump in
offshore RMB interbank lending rates, with announced plans for further issuances in the
near term. Finally, the PBOC has used communications to signal support for the RMB,
including a public statement saying that China is “capable and confident” of keeping the
RMB stable.2
The latest bout of depreciation and policy responses by the PBOC is most reminiscent of an
episode in June 2018, when the RMB depreciated 4 percent within three weeks following an
escalation of trade tensions with the United States and weaker‐than‐expected Chinese data
releases. At that time, the PBOC also used communications to signal its intention to keep
the RMB stable, fixed the central parity rate stronger, and did not draw down on its foreign
exchange reserves (figure 5).
Both the current and the June 2018 episodes are very different from the RMB weakness in
2015 and 2016, in that these more recent sharp depreciations have not been accompanied by
expectations of future depreciation in the forwards market (figure 1) and private capital
outflows have been much more modest (figure 6). We attribute the observed attenuation
of recent market swings to better PBOC communication and credibility, tightened capital
controls, and better fundamentals in the Chinese economy relative to the 2015–16 episode.
Furthermore, even though the RMB is still managed, it is more market determined now than
it was in 2015 and 2016.
Currently, market participants view 7 yuan per dollar as a soft floor and expect it to be
defended at least until the G‐20 summit at the end of June, as further depreciation of the
RMB could hinder trade negotiations.3 Indeed, we believe that the PBOC would be able to
defend the value of the RMB if it decided to do so, using the more powerful policy tools at
its disposal. For example, it could direct offshore state banks to sell the U.S. dollar for yuan
or use some of its $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.
ss
tt
ee
kk
We think it is unlikely, however, that the PBOC would defend the RMB by running down its rr
aa
MM
foreign exchange reserves as much as it did during the 2015–16 episode, as the PBOC seems
ll
to have a higher tolerance for exchange rate flexibility now than it did in that earlier episode. aa
ccii
Thus, a breakdown in trade negotiations or further signs of slowing Chinese growth may nn
aa
cause the RMB to break through the level of 7 yuan per dollar. nn
FFii
2 PBOC Vice Governor Liu Guoqiang made the remarks in an interview with Financial News on May 24, 2019.
3 Of the 25 most recent forecasts in Bloomberg, none expects the RMB to trade weaker than 7 yuan per
dollar by the end of the second quarter, and only 4 expect it to trade below that level by the end of the year.

heightened concern in financial markets about the outlook for the economy. As such,
financing conditions remain generally supportive of spending, except perhaps for
ongoing tight conditions for households with low credit scores.
• Corporate bond issuance was strong in May, and the calendar for upcoming
deals appears robust. However, a few corporations reportedly chose not to
issue as spreads and market volatility increased.
• Business lending overall appeared to decelerate somewhat in the second
quarter, with the slowdown beginning before the recent market volatility.
Strong issuance of corporate bonds was counterbalanced by subdued C&I loan
growth and muted issuance of new-money institutional leveraged loans.
• Mortgage rates decreased notably and now stand at levels last seen in 2017,
facilitating a solid pace of home-purchase originations. Refinance
originations increased but remained relatively muted.
• Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the first quarter. Interest
rates on consumer debt remained above their levels in late 2015 and appeared
to weigh somewhat on the demand for consumer credit.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
The market volatility over the intermeeting period has left, so far, little discernible
imprint on the flow of credit to corporations, and we judge that financing conditions for
businesses overall have remained accommodative, with yields having remained low by
historical standards. A few corporations reportedly chose not to issue bonds in this
s
n
climate, but the calendar for upcoming deals appears robust. Early reports also do not o

quarter pace. Gross issuance of corporate bonds was strong in May, even if a bit below
market expectations, following a spell of seasonal weakness in April. Meanwhile, new-
money institutional leveraged loan issuance was muted in April. C&I loan growth also
slowed somewhat in April and May after a period of stronger growth in the first quarter.
Public equity issuance has been very strong in the second quarter even as equity
prices have fallen. Gross equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings
remained robust in April and May. Looking ahead, several sizable offerings are expected
over the next few months.
Near-term measures of corporate credit quality appeared to remain solid. The
volume of nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades outpaced that of downgrades in May.
Similarly, the KMV expected year-ahead default rate continued to tick down in April and
May, reaching its lowest point since last September, and it currently stands near the
midpoint of its historical distribution. After having been revised downward for several
months, expectations of year-ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms were little
revised in recent months.1
Even so, preliminary information about firm balance sheets from the first quarter
indicates that the aggregate ratio of liquid assets to total assets continued to recede from
the extraordinarily high levels of recent years. Some of the decrease in the liquid asset
ratio is likely the result of the robust pace of share repurchases over the past year that was
sparked by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Meanwhile, the aggregate debt-to-asset
ratio increased notably in the first quarter, reportedly because of an accounting change
that requires firms to bring operating leases onto their balance sheets.2
Small Business
Available data suggest that the supply of credit to small businesses remained
accommodative, while demand continued to be somewhat weak. The percentage of
respondents to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) monthly member
polls reporting in April that their borrowing needs were not satisfied remained low.

capital expenditures in the next six months held steady at a relatively low level. Call
Report data show continued slow growth in large banks’ outstanding balances of small
loans to businesses in the first quarter of this year.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions remained generally accommodative for commercial real
estate (CRE). Bank CRE lending expanded in April and May at a slower rate than in the
first quarter. In CMBS markets, triple-A spreads widened slightly but remained near the
low end of their post-crisis range, and agency and non-agency CMBS issuance was solid
in May. New commitments from life insurance companies to fund CRE mortgages
continued to be robust through the first quarter, roughly matching their average pace over
the past several years.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative. Gross
issuance of municipal bonds was solid in April and May, with new capital raising
accounting for the majority of the issuance. Municipal bond yields in both the secondary
and primary markets decreased somewhat, while spreads over comparable-maturity
Treasury securities widened somewhat in the secondary market. Moreover, the credit
quality of general obligation bonds continued to improve as the number of credit rating
upgrades strongly outpaced that of downgrades in both April and May.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased moderately over
the intermeeting period, as the rate on 30-year conforming mortgages moved down
35 basis points, in line with yields on 10-year Treasury securities. With mortgage rates
down more than 1 full percentage point since last November, home-purchase originations
have returned to the solid levels seen in 2017. In contrast, refinancing volumes moved up
but remained fairly low, as many borrowers appear to have locked in financing during
other low-rate periods in the past few years. Cash-out refinancing volumes also remained
low despite sustained increases in aggregate home equity. Credit availability—as
measured by our estimate of lenders’ maximum available debt-to-income ratio—for
residential mortgages to prime and near-prime borrowers looked to be accommodative

and in line with levels seen in the early 2000s but remained relatively tight for borrowers
with low credit scores.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets appeared to remain generally
supportive of growth in consumer spending, although supply conditions continued to be
tight for subprime credit card borrowers. Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace
in the first quarter, with bank credit data pointing to a pickup in April and May. The
moderate pace of consumer credit growth may reflect, in part, a restraint on demand
brought about by the sustained increases in the past couple of years in consumer interest
rates, which tend to be tied to shorter-term rates. (The box “Drivers of Recent Changes
in Credit Card Interest Rates” provides more information on the change in credit card
rates since December 2015.) In recent months, though, auto interest rates have moved
sideways, and the share of respondents to the University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers reporting favorable financing conditions for auto loans has risen, albeit from
subdued levels. In consumer ABS markets, issuance was robust, and spreads were little
changed at low levels.
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS INDEXES
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial
corporations indicates that financing conditions have tightened slightly, on net, over the
intermeeting period but remained accommodative relative to historical standards. The
tightening in the financing conditions index is consistent with the decline in equity prices
and widening of corporate spreads over the same period. As shown in the appendix to
this Tealbook section, financial conditions indexes that aggregate large sets of financial
variables into summary series also generally pointed to tighter but broadly
accommodative financial conditions.

Drivers of Recent Changes in Credit Card Interest Rates
Credit card interest rates, plotted in figure 1, have increased substantially over the past few years
and have risen as much as 290 basis points since the December 2015 liftoff of the target federal
funds rate from its effective lower bound. They now stand at their highest levels since the first
quarter of 2001.
Figure 2 plots the spread of credit card interest rates over the prime rate (the top of the target
range for the federal funds rate plus 300 basis points). The vast majority of credit cards have
variable rates that are linked to prime rates. The spreads are much flatter than the card interest
rates, with increases since December 2015 of about 35 to 65 basis points. Thus, more than
three-fourths of the rise in credit card rates since late 2015 reflect increases in the federal funds
rate.
The increases in spreads since December 2015 may be related to a greater prevalence of credit
card rewards payments and rises in nonprime delinquencies. Supervisory data (the FR Y-14M)
show a substantial increase in credit card rewards over the past few years. The increase in rates
may help offset greater rewards costs to card issuers. From the second quarter of 2015 through
the first quarter of 2019, near-prime and subprime delinquency rates of 30 days or more increased
about 75 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively.
As shown in the table, the changes in spreads differ substantially by credit score, with spreads for
prime accounts falling about 20 basis points, but spreads for near-prime and subprime accounts
rising about 60 basis points and 85 basis points, respectively. As subprime and near-prime
borrowers are more likely to revolve balances and less likely to have cards with rewards than
prime borrowers, they are probably bearing the increase in rates more heavily.

Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere. The historical
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes.”

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 7, 2019
The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations, measures financing
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1 This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade. To the extent
that speculative-grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment-grade
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.
The second index in the table measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending
Practices. Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on
their balance sheets.2
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary
series using various statistical methods. While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial
market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both changes in financing conditions
and other shocks to the economy.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS U

s

We have become more concerned about downside risks to our economic projection since s
Ri
the previous Tealbook and now consider the risks to our baseline projection as tilted to the
downside over the next year. Beyond the next year, we continue to see the risks as skewed to the
downside.
Beginning with our assessment for the next year, while uncertainties have increased since
April, we still view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity as being
broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by the FOMC; that
period includes a number of episodes with elevated uncertainty and market volatility. However,
we now judge the risks around our baseline projection for real GDP growth to be tilted to the
downside, with a skew to the upside for the unemployment rate. An important factor in our
assessment is that trade policies and foreign economic developments, along with financial
market reactions, seem more likely to move further in directions that would have more
significant negative effects on U.S. economic activity than to resolve more favorably than
assumed. Also, the soft tone of some recent economic indicators, such as business investment
and industrial production, could be pointing to a more substantial slowing in economic growth
than in the baseline. On the upside, many of the underlying fundamentals for household
spending and business investment remain solid—bolstered, in part, by the 2017 tax cuts—with
strong labor market conditions, low interest rates, and quite upbeat readings on consumer
sentiment. In these circumstances, consumer spending and investment could expand at a pace
that is faster than in the staff projection.
As shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit,
the probability estimate of moving into recession over the next year based on a term spread
model has moved up to 67 percent, and the estimate from a model-averaging approach, which
uses a selection of real and financial variables, has climbed to 51 percent; both estimates are
higher than in the previous Tealbook and well above the unconditional recession probability of
23 percent. In contrast, the four-quarter-ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth
and the unemployment rate, presented in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year
Ahead,” are still not unusually wide or skewed.

Beyond a year ahead, we continue to be concerned about downside risks to our economic
y
t
n
projection, given the historically low unemployment rate projected over the medium term. As ai
t
r
shown in the exhibit “Conditional Distributions of Macroeconomic Variables 2 Years Ahead,” e
c
n
the estimated distributions are currently skewed to the upside for the unemployment rate and U
&
skewed to the downside for GDP growth two years ahead.1 In addition, as indicated in the
s
k
s
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk,” the estimated probability of returning to the effective Ri
lower bound (ELB) over the next three years is currently 19 percent, and it rises further to around
34 percent by the end of the medium term. Given the proximity of the federal funds rate to the
ELB, monetary policy may have less capacity to offset negative economic shocks than positive
ones, contributing to a downside skew in economic outcomes.
With regard to inflation, the staff still sees average uncertainty around the projection, but
with the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation
projection would also tend to have a downward skew. To the downside, the soft data on
consumer prices earlier this year could be more persistent than assumed in the baseline. In
addition, underlying inflation could currently be even lower than assumed in the baseline. Also,
the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more than expected and put downward pressure
on inflation. To the upside, an extended period with unusually tight resource utilization could
eventually lead to greater upward pressure on wages and prices, consistent with the predictions
of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation. In addition, an
unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to higher inflation.
Inflation risks would tend to be of relatively modest size as long as inflation expectations
remained reasonably well anchored. However, the risks could increase substantially, in either
direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down. Such movements in
expectations could induce changes in inflation to build upon themselves and thus lead inflation to
deviate more significantly and persistently from 2 percent.
1 The results shown in the exhibit are consistent with recent research, using quantile regressions, on the
distribution of fluctuations in the unemployment rate and in real GDP growth. For the unemployment rate, see
Michael Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018-067 (Washington:
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067. For real
GDP growth, see Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Nellie Liang, and Sheheryar Malik (2018), “The Term
Structure of Growth-at-Risk,” Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Working Paper 42 (Washington:
Brookings Institute, August), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WP42-NL-updated.pdf. The
results of their research suggest that the upside risk to the unemployment rate and downside risk to GDP growth are
more pronounced in the medium term—specifically, two to three years ahead—particularly when the unemployment
rate is low or credit growth is high.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS y
t
n
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline
ai
t
r
e
projection using simulations of staff models. We simulate each of these scenarios using one of c
n
U
two models maintained by the staff, which embed different macroeconomic structures and
&
dynamics.2 In four of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the baseline policy rule k s
s
introduced in the April Tealbook, which assumes a smaller coefficient on the output gap.
Ri
However, in the two scenarios that feature deteriorating economic conditions, we assume the
same parameter values in the policy rule used in earlier Tealbooks, which puts more weight on
the output gap than in the new baseline rule specification. Under the conditions in these two
scenarios, we judge it unlikely that monetary policy would react in the manner embodied in the
new baseline rule, because output growth slows notably. Finally, the size and composition of the
SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios.
Increased Uncertainty [FRB/US]
The recent softness in some spending and production indicators may indicate that
macroeconomic uncertainty is having a more adverse effect on the U.S. economy than assumed
in the baseline projection. In this scenario, we assume that uncertainty increases substantially
more over the coming quarters and that this results in weaker business investment and consumer
durable outlays both this year and next year.
All told, GDP growth is 0.7 percent in the second half of this year and 1.6 percent in
2020, comparable with the slowing seen in the 2015–16 period, and the unemployment rate starts
rising this year, reaching 4 percent in the second half of 2020. With a more subdued path for
economic activity, inflation runs slightly below the baseline over the projection period. In this
scenario, policymakers begin cutting rates this year, and the federal funds rate edges down to
roughly 2 percent by 2021, as policymakers respond to the slowdown in economic activity in
accordance with a policy rule that puts a greater weight on the output gap than in the baseline
rule.3
2 The two models used are (1) FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy, and (2) GEMUS, which is a calibrated two-country DSGE model.
3 Specifically, the policy rule used in this scenario assumes a coefficient of 1 on the output gap.
Alternatively, if we used the baseline policy rule with an output gap coefficient of 0.2, the federal funds rate would
remain roughly flat. In this case, the unemployment rate would reach 4.1 percent by the end of 2020. GDP growth
would still be 0.7 percent in the second half of this year but a bit lower than in the scenario at 1.5 percent in 2020.

Lower Inflation Expectations [FRB/US] y
t
n
ai
t
Total and core PCE price inflation have, on average, run below the Committee’s e r
c
n
2 percent objective for most of the past decade. In addition, some measures of longer-run U
&
inflation expectations have drifted down in the past several years. In the baseline projection,
s
k
longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting are assumed to generate an Ri s
underlying inflation trend that remains at 1.8 percent through the medium term. However, there
is a risk that actual inflation expectations are anchored at a level somewhat below what is
assumed in the baseline. In this scenario, we consider the possibility that the private sector’s
longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with underlying trend inflation that has been at
1.5 percent for a year now and that it will remain at that level for an extended period of time.
Policymakers are assumed to currently recognize this lower underlying inflation trend.
Lower inflation expectations lead to actual inflation running below the baseline and
hovering slightly above 1.5 percent over the projection period. Lower realized inflation implies
that the federal funds rate stays below the baseline throughout the projection period and stands
almost ½ percent below the baseline by 2024. Real GDP growth as well as the unemployment
rate are little changed over the projection period, as the nominal federal funds rate evolves in
tandem with inflation, leaving real interest rates essentially unchanged.
Stronger Aggregate Supply [FRB/US]
The unemployment rate is currently about 1 percentage point below the staff’s
4.6 percent estimate for its natural rate. Nevertheless, wage gains have remained modest in
recent years because, in the staff’s assessment, underlying inflation has been below 2 percent and
trend productivity growth has been slow. However, another way of reconciling modest wage
growth with a very low unemployment rate is that resource utilization may be less tight than
assumed in the baseline. In this scenario, the level of potential output in recent years is assumed
to have been higher than judged in the baseline, such that the output gap was close to zero in the
middle of last year. Moreover, this scenario assumes that potential output growth in future years
is faster than in the baseline. Specifically, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has
been lower in the past several years than in the baseline and continues to fall to 3.75 percent at
the end of 2019, more than ¾ percentage point lower than in the baseline.4 We also assume that
4 A natural rate of 3.75 percent is comparable to the average of the 10 lowest forecasts for the longer-run
unemployment rate submitted by respondents in the March 2019 long-range Blue Chip survey.

Because we assume that households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential s
Ri
growth and its implications for income and profits, consumer spending and investment are
stronger. GDP growth is, on average, about 1 percentage point per year above the baseline. The
unemployment rate falls further than in the baseline and declines to just below 2¾ percent by the
end of 2024, almost 1½ percentage points lower than in the staff projection. Nevertheless, the
path for inflation is slightly below the baseline, on average, reflecting primarily the stronger
productivity growth in this scenario. Because policymakers are assumed to recognize the
supply-side conditions and see the smaller positive output gap persisting for several years, the
path of the federal funds rate is about 25 basis points lower, on average, than in the baseline.
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US]
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment
remain solid, including quite upbeat readings on consumer sentiment, strong labor market
conditions, and low interest rates. In this scenario, we assume that consumer spending and, in
turn, investment expand at a pace faster than in the baseline. Given the strong cyclical
improvement in labor force participation in recent years, we assume that these favorable
conditions bring about greater labor force participation, a feature that is similar to what is in the
staff baseline projection.
Under these assumptions, GDP increases 3 percent, on average, in 2019 and 2020, which
is a pace comparable with that in 2018. With a greater-than-typical response from labor force
participation boosting the supply of available workers, the unemployment rate declines to about
3 percent in 2021, a smaller decline than what the model’s Okun’s law relationship would
suggest. Inflation increases slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2024. In response to the stronger
economy, and with inflation little changed, the federal funds rate rises relative to the baseline,
reaching about 3 percent in 2022.

y Escalation of Trade Tensions [GEMUS]
t
n
ai
t
r
e Our current baseline assumes a ceasefire in ongoing trade disputes, meaning that the
c
n
U United States and its trading partners impose no new tariffs but that existing tariffs, including
&
those raised in May on a sizable tranche of Chinese imports, remain in place. However,
s
k
s
Ri President Trump has also threatened additional tariffs on all remaining imports from China not
yet subject to tariffs. In addition, the President announced a plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican
imports starting on June 10, with the tariff rate gradually increasing in the second half of this year.
While the effects of the tariffs imposed so far have been modest, it is likely that
widespread and sustained increases in future tariffs would entail sizable adverse effects. This
scenario assumes that, in the second half of 2019, tariffs of 25 percent are imposed on about
$300 billion of imports from Mexico and $275 billion of imports not previously tariffed from
China and that Mexico and China partially retaliate. Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports,
while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies have only a small effect on the
trade balance. However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods depresses household
spending while business spending declines, both as a result of the higher cost of imported capital
goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing spreads to rise and equity prices
to fall. In addition, we assume that the heightened trade tensions cause a widespread decline in
global sentiment, which, adding to the pressures previously described, leads to an overall decline
in equity prices of about 20 percent by the end of 2019.
All told, these developments result in a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy that
lasts through 2020. Real GDP growth drops to only 0.3 percent in the second half of 2019 and
rises to only 1.3 percent in 2020. Higher import prices boost core PCE inflation to 3.5 percent in
the second half of this year before inflation falls below the baseline as the effect of the new
tariffs dies out and as the economy slows down. Because the jump in inflation is transitory, we
assume that policymakers decide to “see through” it and focus on the weakness in economic
activity. Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline,
declining to 1.9 percent by the end of 2020, 0.7 percentage point below the baseline.5
5 This scenario considers a policy rule that assumes a coefficient of 1 on the output gap. Alternatively, if
we used the baseline policy rule with an output gap coefficient of 0.2, GDP growth would average about 0.2 percent
over the next two years, and the unemployment rate would rise to 4.9 percent by the end of 2021.

Favorable Trade Deals [GEMUS] y

ai
t
On the upside, there could be positive news on trade. In this scenario, we assume not e r
c
n
only that the United States avoids imposing tariffs on Mexico (as in our baseline), but that it U
&
reaches a trade deal with China, perhaps as soon as the proposed Trump–Xi summit on the
s
k
sidelines of the G-20 meeting on June 28 and June 29. In particular, we assume that the Ri s
25 percent tariff imposed by the United States on $180 billion in imports from China since
September 2018, as well as the retaliation to these measures by China, are rolled back. For the
case of Mexico, we assume that some manner of resolution reduces uncertainty around trade
with this country, thus boosting consumer and business confidence.
Lower tariffs, stronger global confidence, and improved financial conditions boost
economic activity in the United States and abroad. U.S. real GDP expands 2.1 percent in the
second half of 2019 and 2.4 percent in 2020. Lower import prices caused by the rollback of the
previously imposed tariffs cause core PCE inflation to drop to 1.7 percent in the second half of
this year, before inflation returns to close to the baseline in 2020. The federal funds rate is only
slightly higher, on average, over the projection horizon.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, the FRB/US model projects real
GDP growth to slow from 3 percent in 2018 to about 1¾ percent in 2019 and to roughly
1½ percent in the next two years.6 The forecast of real GDP growth is revised up 0.3 percentage
point in 2019 compared with the previous Tealbook. The revision primarily reflects both better-
than-expected (from the model’s perspective) consumption growth and a downward revision to
the path of long-term interest rates in the first half (the model now conditions on the data and the
staff forecast through the second quarter). In terms of contour, the projected deceleration in real
GDP mainly reflects the projection that both consumption and business investment growth fall
back from what the model perceives as unusually strong readings in recent years. In the case of
consumption, the model could not explain those positive surprises based on fundamentals
(wealth and income) and hence does not carry that strength forward in the projection; instead, it
has consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend. The model’s assessment that asset
prices (equity and property wealth) are currently above normal valuations and thus will fall or
6 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projections for variables from the U.S. government
sector, foreign real GDP growth, foreign inflation, and the paths of the U.S. dollar and oil prices. The federal funds
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline.

The EDO model projects real GDP growth to average 2¼ percent over the next three
years, close to the model’s estimate of average potential growth. The output gap is currently
estimated to be negative 0.2 percent, and it remains slightly negative through 2021. Core
inflation hovers around the Committee’s 2 percent objective after 2019. For a number of years,
wages have been below the level consistent with the model’s wage Phillips curve, holding down
marginal costs and depressing inflation over that period. The model expects these wage shocks
to fade gradually.

s This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection y
t
n
errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of ai
t
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction e r
c
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the n
U
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and &
s
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any k
s
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
Ri
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. Compared with the April Tealbook, the current
projection of the output gap is narrower, as GDP growth is now anticipated to be slower
this year and next year, while the inflation forecast is little changed. In light of the staff’s
revisions to the outlook, the prescribed paths of the strategies over the medium run are
generally lower than in the April Tealbook, though for most strategies, the differences
are small.
A special exhibit compares the stabilization properties of flexible average
inflation targeting—a strategy in which policymakers seek to offset past inflation misses
that occur over a fixed-length reference period—with those of flexible price-level
targeting (FPLT), under which policymakers seek to offset all the inflation misses
accumulated since a given reference date. An additional exhibit provides updated
estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four simple policy rules: the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and an FPLT rule.1 These near-term
prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for the output gap and core
inflation, which are shown in the middle panels.2 The top and middle panels also provide
the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate.
• Reflecting the narrower output gap, the near-term prescriptions of the policy
rules are slightly lower than in the April Tealbook.
1 The appendix in this Tealbook section provides technical details on these simple policy rules.
Except for the first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of
the projection of the output gap.

1. The lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for
inflation and resource slack. Rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable are conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the March 2019 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r*.

• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes higher policy rates than the
Tealbook baseline, because it responds more strongly to the positive output
gap than the conditional attenuated rule underlying the Tealbook baseline
projection.
• The Taylor (1993) rule, which does not feature an interest rate smoothing
term, calls for higher policy rates than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule.
• The first-difference rule, which responds to the change in the expected output
gap, advises keeping the federal funds rate fairly close to its current level
because of the projection that the output gap will remain similar to its current
size, on balance, over the next year.
• The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the core PCE
price index of 2.6 percent since the end of 2011, prescribes a decrease in the
federal funds rate in the third quarter and a further decline to less than
2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*) generated under two baselines: the
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March 2019
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).3 In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US
model are used. This concept of r*, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the
real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in the current
quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. This
concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy and
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2021 (the
final year reported in the March 2019 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth
and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the
SEP. For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or
avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate.
• The current value of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*, at 1.79 percent, is
about 25 basis points lower than its estimate in the April Tealbook; the
difference reflects the staff’s projection of a narrower output gap.
• At 0.91 percent, the corresponding March SEP-consistent FRB/US r* remains
significantly lower than the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The difference
stems from the fact that the SEP-consistent projection has output exceeding
e s potential by a smaller amount over the medium term than does the current

n simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993)
o
M
rule, the first-difference rule, and the FPLT rule. These simulations reflect the
endogenous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different federal funds
rate paths implied by the policy rules. The simulations for each rule are carried out under
the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the
implications for interest rates and the economy. Compared with the previous Tealbook,
most simple rules prescribe lower paths for the federal funds rate. Over the near term, the
size of the decrease varies by rule, but by 2023, all the simple rules imply policy rate
paths that are lower by about 15 to 30 basis points relative to the corresponding
prescriptions in the April Tealbook.
• Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook
baseline, the federal funds rate edges up by about ¼ percentage point over the
next few years, leaving the policy rate little changed from the path in the April
Tealbook.
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output

gap, calls for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace and to reach
nearly 3½ percent by mid-2021, after which it remains above the Tealbook
baseline path for an extended period of time. The less accommodative
monetary conditions also produce an unemployment rate that, unlike in the
Tealbook baseline, rises steadily toward the staff’s estimate of the natural rate
of unemployment. As a result, inflation is lower, and the real 10-year
Treasury yield is higher, than the corresponding values in the Tealbook
projection.
• Similarly, the Taylor (1993) rule calls for increases in the federal funds rate
over the rest of this year and early next year. After that, the federal funds rate
path prescribed by this rule is below the corresponding path under the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule but above the path in the Tealbook baseline. This initial
difference arises because the Taylor (1993) rule has no inertial component and
therefore adjusts the path of policy upward immediately in response to the
high level of the current output gap. The magnitude of the output-gap
response in the Taylor (1993) rule is lower than in the inertial Taylor (1999)
rule but greater than in the baseline rule underlying the staff’s projection. As
a result, the paths for the real 10-year Treasury yield, unemployment rate, and
inflation rate implied by the Taylor (1993) rule are between the corresponding
paths under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline.
• The first-difference rule, which reacts to the expected change in the output
gap rather than its level, prescribes small, gradual increases in the federal
funds rate through 2020, followed by a sequence of reductions when the
output gap is projected to narrow. Later in the projection, the federal funds
rate path under this rule drops slightly below its Tealbook counterpart. As a
result, relative to the Tealbook baseline, this prescription generates a similar
near-term, but lower medium-term, unemployment rate path and somewhat
higher inflation.
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate, the cumulative shortfall of
the level of core PCE prices from a target path for that price level that grows
at an annual rate of 2 percent from the end of 2011 onward. Eliminating the
current 2.6 percent shortfall of the core PCE price index requires inflation to
run above 2 percent in coming years. Because the simulation embeds the
assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

time and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters
correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the
path of the real 10-year Treasury rate immediately drops and remains below
the Tealbook baseline throughout the period shown. As a result, the
unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline and all
other simulations, dropping below 3¼ percent in 2021. Inflation exceeds
2 percent by nearly ¼ percentage point, on average, over the next decade
before slowly returning to 2 percent.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under two different
assumptions about policymakers’ preferences captured by different specifications of the
loss function.4 The concept of optimal control employed here assumes policymakers are
able to commit future policymakers to their plans; such a commitment, where feasible,
may lead to improved economic outcomes.5
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path, though this path has been revised
down, relative to the April Tealbook, about 30 to 50 basis points over the next
two years.6 This strategy is designed to counter the projected sizable and
persistent undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate that
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that may not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.
6 Because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and credible, changes in the
federal funds rate are not disruptive, regardless of the magnitude of their departure from historical norms.
In practice, however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate extraordinarily abruptly, wage
and price setters and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may
anticipate tighter monetary policy than policymakers envision, in which case macroeconomic outcomes
may be less favorable than would otherwise be the case.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

occurs in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with the
equal-weights loss function judge to be undesirable. The smaller
unemployment gap generates only moderate downward pressure on inflation
because, in the FRB/US model, the response of inflation to the current level of
resource utilization is small.
• The second simulation, labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss
function that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the
natural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but is
otherwise identical to the specification with equal weights. Under this
strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is considerably below the path
under equal weights, but it is little changed relative to the April Tealbook and
only slightly below the current Tealbook baseline path. Policymakers choose
this slightly more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire
to keep inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the
unemployment rate falling below its natural rate. The tighter labor market
pushes inflation more promptly toward 2 percent than in the case of
equal weights.
MAKEUP STRATEGIES IN A DISINFLATION SCENARIO
The exhibit “Makeup Strategies in a Disinflation Scenario” examines monetary
policy strategies that aim to undo, in part or in full, past deviations of inflation from its
2 percent objective. We present the effects of three makeup strategies: a version of the
FPLT rule and two parameterizations of a flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT)
rule.7 To illustrate the differences between these strategies, we consider their effects in a
disinflation scenario. Under the FPLT rule, policymakers commit to making up all
inflation misses since the reference date, taken here to be 2011:Q4; inflation misses since
that reference date never become bygones. Under the FAIT rules we consider here,
policymakers seek to make up for the cumulative deviation of inflation from 2 percent
over a rolling window of fixed length: four or eight years. Specifically, under FAIT with
an eight-year window, the reference interval ranges initially from 2011:Q4 to 2019:Q3,
then from 2012:Q1 to 2019:Q4 in the subsequent quarter, and so forth; past inflation
7 In order to facilitate comparison across rules, the version of the FPLT rule used in this exhibit
differs from the version used elsewhere in this section of Tealbook A. The FPLT rule here, as well as the
FAIT rules used in this exhibit, feature the same coefficient on the output gap as the conditional attenuated
rule in the Tealbook baseline. See the appendix to this section for more detail.

misses that drop out of the eight-year window are no longer relevant for policy and
become bygones. As with the FPLT rule, we assume that the commitment to pursue
FAIT is viewed as credible.
• In the disinflation scenario, which is constructed using the conditional
attenuated rule, persistent downward pressure causes inflation to fall from
1.6 percent in 2019:Q3 to 1.2 percent in early 2021 before slowly recovering
to 2 percent by the end of 2026.8 All three makeup strategies call for notably
lower paths of the policy rate than the path implied by the conditional
attenuated rule (the black line). The prescribed decline in the policy rate is
larger under makeup rules that consider longer windows of past inflation
misses, with the prescriptions of the eight-year FAIT rule and the FPLT rule
remaining below 1 percent for several years.
• The path for core PCE inflation is shown in the middle panel of the exhibit.
The shaded areas highlight past deviations of inflation from the 2 percent
objective over the four- and eight-year intervals ending in 2019:Q3, the start
date of the simulation. Because the initial cumulative inflation gap under the
eight-year FAIT rule (shown by the yellow cross-hatched area) is considerably
larger than under the four-year FAIT rule (shown in red), the eight-year FAIT
rule prescribes a much lower path for the federal funds rate than the four-year
FAIT rule. The shaded areas in the panel translate into the initial values in
2019:Q3 under the respective FAIT rules, shown in the lower-right panel,
“Rule-Specific Cumulative Inflation Gaps.”
• The differences between FAIT and FPLT stem from the fact that past inflation
misses, should they not be offset in a timely fashion by subsequent above-
target inflation readings, will eventually become bygones under the FAIT
rules but not under FPLT. The “Rule-Specific Cumulative Inflation Gaps”
panel reports the value of the cumulative inflation deviation from 2 percent,
conditional on the relevant window associated with each makeup rule. Under
FPLT, this interval expands over time and, therefore, a negative cumulative
inflation gap can only be resolved by periods of inflation exceeding 2 percent,
like the one beginning in late 2022. By contrast, under the FAIT rules, the
8 The scenario is accomplished through a constant anticipated sequence of small, exogenous
shocks to the FRB/US model equation for core inflation from 2019:Q3 through 2027:Q2.

negative cumulative inflation gap can be ameliorated not just by periods of
inflation exceeding 2 percent, but also by the passage of time, as previous
inflation deviations fall out of the relevant window. Under the eight-year
FAIT rule in this simulation, inflation returns to 2 percent in mid-2024, but
the cumulative inflation gap moves up almost two years earlier, when large
inflation misses that occurred in 2014 and 2015 become bygones.
• When faced with persistent undershooting or overshooting of the 2 percent
inflation objective, policy rules that seek to make up for inflation deviations
over relatively long periods can be associated with more severe time-
s
e inconsistency problems than policy rules with shorter windows. In particular,

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The next exhibit updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds
rate in the longer run, denoted rLR. This concept is the rate consistent with the economy
operating at its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated.
This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer-run level
of the nominal federal funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and
economic models. In addition, rLR is also a parameter in many of the simple policy rules,
including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of
Tealbook A.
• The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of historical values through
2019:Q1 for several model-based time-series estimates of rLR.9 The estimates
9 See the appendix to this section for sources and methodology. Although the modeling
approaches and econometric techniques differ across models, the studies have the common feature that they

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 7, 2019
for 2019:Q1 range from 0.3 to 2 percent, with a mean of roughly 1 percent.
The range and mean of the 2019:Q1 point estimates are only slightly changed
from the corresponding statistics reported for 2018:Q4 in the March
Tealbook.10
• Time-series estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as
depicted in the middle panel. The sources of this uncertainty vary across the
studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach as well
as the uncertainty that exists within each model about the prevailing state of
the economy and of the model’s parameter estimates.
• The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer-term forecasts of the real federal
funds rate from selected sources. The Tealbook baseline assumption, at
½ percent, is below the other measures, which range from 0.74 to
1.13 percent. That said, the evidence presented in this exhibit, taken as a
whole, indicates that the Tealbook baseline assumption is consistent with
time-series and survey estimates, especially in light of the fact that all of these
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty.
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and optimal control
simulations shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment.”
use time-series methods to infer rLR from the co-movement of either macroeconomic series (like inflation,
interest rates, and output) or both macroeconomic and financial data (like TIPS yields).
10 For a discussion of time-series estimates of rLR over history, see the Monetary Policy Strategies
section of the October 2017 Tealbook A. There are differences in the historical paths of rLR across the
studies. The top panel reports the range of one-sided estimates, meaning that the estimates for a particular
date only condition on data up to that date. All of the point estimates used to compute the range have
declined since the early 2000s. Estimates that condition on all available data generally suggest a slow
decline of rLR, which is consistent with the importance of secular factors such as changes in demographics
or a productivity growth slowdown.

Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the
Tealbook baseline projection.1 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy
for quarter t; for quarters prior to the projection period under consideration, corresponds to the

The first rule in the table was studied by Taylor (1993). The inertial Taylor (1999) rule
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time compared with the
Taylor (1993) rule. The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap, like the
FPLT rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 The conditional
attenuated rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but places a coefficient of α
on the output gap that is conditional on economic conditions; in the current Tealbook projection,
α is set to 0.2. Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and
chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objecti𝐿𝐿v𝐿𝐿e and an
𝑟𝑟
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent. The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
2 For applications, see, for example, Erceg and others (2012). An FPLT rule similar to the one
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).

and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection. This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.3 The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the
difference between four-quarter headline PCE price inflation, , and the Committee’s
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( , meas𝑃𝑃u𝑃𝑃r𝑃𝑃ed as the difference between
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the
𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
federal funds rate. In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, :

The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the
absolute) values of the weights.
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates. Policy tools other than the
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy
decisions made prior to the simulation period.

MAKEUP STRATEGIES IN A DISINFLATION SCENARIO
The two types of simple rules shown in the special exhibit “Makeup Strategies in a
Disinflation Scenario” have been harmonized to use the same form as the staff’s conditional
attenuated rule, with an inertial coefficient of 0.85 and a smaller response to the output gap. The
FPLT rule used in the special exhibit differs from the one used in the “Simple Policy Rules”
section, as it responds to = 0.2 times the output gap rather than the unemployment gap with a
coefficient of -1. The table “Makeup Rules” gives the exact expressions for the two simple

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The top panel of the exhibit “Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of from eight time-series models based on the
following studies: Christensen and Rudebusc𝐿𝐿h𝐿𝐿 (forthcoming); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni,
𝑟𝑟
and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016);
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2019); and Lubik and
Matthes (2015). For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data
through 2019:Q1. Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they
make use of historical data only up to that point in time. As a result, their historical movements
can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each
model’s point estimate for 2019:Q1. The computation and interpretation of these bands are
specific to each study.
The bottom panel shows values from selected forecasters. These values were
obtained as follows: 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿
𝑟𝑟
• “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real
federal funds rate in the longer run.
• “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal funds
rate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the
March 2019 SEP.
