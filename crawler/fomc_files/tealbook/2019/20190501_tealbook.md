Monetary Policy Alternatives
Information received since the Committee met in March indicates that the labor
market has remained strong. Payrolls rose 196,000 in March, following the weak reading
in February. For the first quarter as a whole, job gains averaged 180,000 per month—a
solid rate of job growth but slower than the average monthly pace for 2018. The
unemployment rate held steady at 3.8 percent in March. Recent data on household
spending and business fixed investment have been consistent with GDP growth slowing
in the first quarter from its strong pace in 2018, albeit by less than previously projected.
Consumer price data have been softer than expected in recent months. Based on current
information, the staff estimates that core PCE inflation was 1.6 percent over the
12 months ending in March and projects it to edge up to 1.8 percent by the end of the
year.
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presented below offer a
range of options for communicating the likely future path of monetary policy.
Alternative B is intended to reaffirm the policy message that was conveyed in the March
postmeeting statement. The case for a “patient” approach to monetary policy is
buttressed by the recent downside surprise to inflation as well as by remaining
uncertainty about the extent to which the recent softness in economic indicators will
prove to be transitory. Alternative B continues to indicate that, based on the current
stance of policy, the Committee views sustained expansion of economic activity, strong
labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent
objective as the most likely outcomes.
Alternative A conveys a more-accommodative posture than Alternative B by
replacing the “patient” characterization with a signal that a cut in the federal funds rate
may soon be appropriate. This alternative notes that inflation is “softening” and that,
consequently, the Committee will “assess whether it may soon become appropriate to
adjust the target range” to achieve the Committee’s desired outcomes.
Alternative C is based on some future scenario in which the economy continues to
perform well and another increase in the federal funds rate may be seen as appropriate.
Under such a scenario, the characterization of incoming data in the first paragraph could
go a long way in shaping expectations for policy. Because current data do not support
such an assessment, and continuing the practice followed in the March Tealbook, no first

paragraph is presented for Alternative C. As noted in the second paragraph, the
Committee could mention the developments justifying a firmer policy stance and signal
that “it may soon become appropriate to adjust the target range.”
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A, B, and C:
 The assessment of the incoming data:
o Alternatives A and B share the same characterization of the incoming data.
Both alternatives note that the labor market remains strong, that the
unemployment rate remains low, and that average job gains in recent months
have been “solid.” Alternatives A and B state that “economic activity has
been rising at a moderate rate” and that “growth of household spending and
business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter.” The alternatives also
note that “overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy
have declined and are running below 2 percent.” Regarding indicators of
inflation expectations, Alternatives A and B continue to state that “on balance,
market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent
months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are
little changed.”
o As noted above, Alternative C omits a description of the incoming data
because it is intended to be considered in some future scenario in which the
data point toward a potential need for further policy firming.
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation:
o Under all three alternatives, the outlook for economic activity and inflation is
unchanged from the March statement. However, to achieve the outcomes of
“sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,
and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective” the
alternatives condition on potentially different paths for the federal funds rate.
 For the current policy decision and the outlook for policy:
o All three alternatives maintain the current target range for the federal funds
rate.
o Alternative B maintains the March perspective that “global economic and
financial developments and muted inflation pressures” are factors that shape
the outlook for policy and states that the Committee “will be patient as it

--- Page 6 ---

determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds
rate may be appropriate” to support the Committee’s outlook.
o Alternative A links the policy outlook predominantly to inflation. In
particular, it states that “in light of softening inflation, the Committee will
assess whether it may soon become appropriate to adjust the target range for
the federal funds rate.”
o By contrast, Alternative C offers an illustrative selection of circumstances
under which an increase in the federal funds rate “may soon become
appropriate.” Specifically, the alternative lists “firmer inflation readings,”
“tightening resource utilization,” or “diminished risks to the outlook” as
possible reasons for considering a change in the stance of policy.

The 199596 Mid‐Cycle Rate Adjustments
A number of market commentaries have discussed whether, in light of recent lower
inflation readings, a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate might
become appropriate to support a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent alongside
strong labor market conditions. With inflation running below 2 percent and economic
growth moderating, inflation expectations could drift downward, potentially making
the current setting of the federal funds rate unwantedly restrictive. Some
commentaries pointed back to several instances in the mid‐1990s when the Committee
was perceived as taking out insurance by cutting the federal funds rate after a series of
rate hikes. This box analyzes the circumstances behind the mid‐cycle adjustments of
policy rates during 1995 and 1996.
Starting in February 1994, the FOMC began raising interest rates to forestall an increase
in inflation. Over the next year, the Committee raised the federal funds rate from
3 percent to 6 percent (figure 1). These rate hikes prevented inflation from rising, while
the unemployment rate continued to decline (figure 2). After the final tightening step
in February 1995, participants viewed the economy as having moved to a more
sustainable path, even though some inflationary pressures still persisted. By the time of
the July 1995 meeting, however, signs of a sharp slowing in economic activity were
accumulating. At that meeting, the Committee decided to cut the federal funds rate
target by 25 basis points. Two more 25 basis point reductions occurred in December
1995 and January 1996. These adjustments were intended to provide insurance against
the risk of an undue weakening of economic activity.
The news leading up to the July 1995 meeting consisted almost entirely of surprises on
the downside. The economy had softened to a greater extent than participants had
anticipated. Nonfarm payroll employment had fallen in April and May, and the
unemployment rate in May had risen somewhat from its first‐quarter average. The
central tendency of participants’ projections, submitted for the Monetary Policy Report,
for real GDP growth in 1995 fell from 2 to 3 percent in February to 1½ to 2 percent in
early July. Pessimism brought on by the decline in jobs was reinforced by the string of
negative reports on retail sales, industrial production, and the leading indicators.
At the July 1995 meeting, most participants perceived the pause in the expansion to be
temporary and anticipated that economic activity would grow near its potential rate
later in the year. However, the risk of a more pronounced slowdown figured
prominently in the Committee’s discussion. With inflation still running near 3 percent,
above what participants considered to be consistent with the price stability mandate,
the key question the Committee confronted was whether an easing in the stance of
policy to support the expansion would risk forestalling further progress toward
reducing inflation. In the event, and as noted earlier, the Committee cut the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points. Participants viewed this adjustment as appropriate
insurance against the risk of a more persistent slowdown. Although participants
discussed a 50 basis point cut, that option was dismissed because, as Chairman

Greenspan put it, they were “concerned about spooking the markets.” They agreed
that there was little harm in leaving a further reduction to a future meeting.
In the following months, the economic expansion picked up again without notable
upward pressure on inflation. Towards the end of the year, however, the economy
again showed signs of slowing. Moreover, the minutes of the December 1995 FOMC
meeting noted that “inflation had slowed from the elevated pace observed in the early
part of the year.” Measures of inflation expectations had also declined over the
previous months, suggesting that the real federal funds rate had increased. Against the
backdrop of a policy stance that most judged as somewhat restrictive, participants at
the December meeting discussed the merits of taking an “opportunistic approach” to
achieving further disinflation. Easing the stance of policy somewhat further was seen
as reducing the risk of a more pronounced economic slowdown without forestalling
further gradual disinflation, as participants noted emerging signs of positive supply side
developments as well as muted inflation pressures abroad. In light of these
considerations, at both the December 1995 and January 1996 meetings, the Committee
decided to reduce the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points.
1995 ended with inflation below 3 percent, alongside a low and steady unemployment
rate of around 5½ percent. Real GDP growth came down from around 4 percent in
1994 to about 2 percent in 1995, but no recession ensued. After the rate cut in January
1996, the federal funds rate target remained stable until the fall of 1998, with the
exception of one rate increase in March 1997. During this period, real GDP growth
rebounded and the unemployment rate drifted lower, while the Committee’s
discussions paid considerable attention to the evolution of actual and projected
inflation. Although high resource utilization started to be reflected in wage increases,
core inflation continued to trend lower. Starting in early 1997, participants expressed
greater confidence in the possible role of faster‐than‐reported productivity increases as
the source of the benign behavior of inflation.

MARCH 2019 FOMC STATEMENT
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January
indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic
activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter. Payroll employment
was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in
recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Recent indicators
point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in
the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a
result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy
remains near 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation
compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of
longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided
to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.
The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity,
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2
percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and
financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be
patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.
3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2
percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Data received in recent weeks suggest that the risk of a pronounced slowing of the
economy has diminished. The staff now estimates that real GDP in the first quarter
rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent; this estimate is about 1 percentage point higher
than projected in the March Tealbook, as data on housing, state and local
construction, and net exports came in stronger than anticipated. Moreover, retail
sales, after declining in February, bounced back in the following month, reflecting
delayed tax refunds that pushed some February spending into March. Household
spending and business fixed investment are estimated to have slowed in the first
quarter, consistent with the expectation that GDP growth is stepping down from its
strong pace in 2018. For the current year as a whole, GDP is projected to grow at a
rate little above the growth rate of potential output.
 Available data indicate that the labor market remains strong.
o After the weakness in February, payrolls rose by 196,000 in March. Given the
very strong figures for January, payroll gains averaged a solid 180,000 per
month for the first quarter, well above the pace that the staff estimates to be
consistent with no change in resource utilization.
o The labor force participation rate ticked down to 63.0 percent in March, while
the unemployment rate stayed at 3.8 percent. Although the unemployment
rate remains below all participants’ estimates of the longer-run rate of
unemployment in the March Summary of Economic Projections,
policymakers do not expect high levels of labor utilization to generate notable
upward pressure on inflation.
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in
March, up from 2.8 percent a year earlier. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta’s wage growth tracker also had a higher reading than a year earlier,
but none of these rates suggest that the labor market is overheating.
 Headline and core PCE inflation rates have declined and are running below the
Committee’s 2 percent objective. Inflation is expected to move up later this year, as
the effects of idiosyncratic and temporary factors that are currently holding down
inflation dissipate.
sevitanretlA

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) April 25, 2019
Page 11 of 36

--- Page 15 ---

o The staff estimates the 12-month change in core PCE prices at 1.6 percent for
March, reflecting in part unusual and notable declines in a few categories.
Staff projects 12-month core inflation to stay around 1.6 percent before
moving up by the end of the summer. For 2019 as a whole, core PCE prices
are expected to increase 1.8 percent. Thereafter, core price inflation is
expected to edge up to 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021. 12-month headline
inflation is expected to run close to core inflation over the projection period.
o Indicators of inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, since the
March Tealbook and suggest that long-term inflation expectations remain
well-anchored.
 Increases in equity prices and declines in corporate-bond yields and spreads have
continued to produce easier financing conditions for businesses and households.
 Although downside risks have diminished somewhat, several persist.
o The factors that have caused the decline in inflation may turn out to be more
persistent than the staff currently projects. In addition, indicators of longer-
term inflation expectations bear watching.
o The possibility that softer household and business spending will turn out to be
more persistent poses downside risks for economic activity.
o The staff has revised up its projection for economic growth in emerging
market economies, although growth in advanced foreign economies is likely
to languish in the near term. Notably, soft euro-area data, especially in
manufacturing, may be signaling more pronounced weakness.
o While a “no-deal, no-transition” Brexit seems to have been avoided for now,
the prolonged uncertainty associated with the Brexit process will weigh on
investment and spending in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, despite
reported progress towards a U.S.-China trade agreement, the outcomes of the
ongoing negotiations remain uncertain.
Policy Strategy
 Policymakers may have anticipated a moderation in overall output growth from
2018 to 2019, and see the first-quarter dip in estimated growth of household and
business spending as transitory. Consequently, they may anticipate a rebound in
spending over the remainder of 2019 and therefore continue to see economic
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) April 25, 2019
Page 12 of 36

--- Page 16 ---

conditions evolving broadly in line with their expectations, notwithstanding notable
risks.
 Policymakers may interpret the decline in inflation as having been caused largely or
entirely by idiosyncratic and temporary factors. Thus, policymakers may be
confident that, under the current monetary policy stance, inflation will rise to the
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
o Policymakers may also anticipate that price pressures from resource
utilization will facilitate the return of inflation to 2 percent.
o In addition, they may judge long-term inflation expectations to be
sufficiently well-anchored to withstand the temporary decline in inflation.
 Seeing muted inflation pressures in the context of near-potential growth and the
policy rate within the range of estimates of its neutral level, policymakers may deem
the current stance of policy as appropriate.
 Market quotes along with responses to the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers
and market participants indicate that a change in the target range at the May meeting
is seen as very unlikely. A statement such as Alternative B also appears generally in
line with the expectations of respondents to the Desk’s surveys. Consequently, a
statement along the lines of Alternative B seems unlikely to generate appreciable
changes in asset prices.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty
Measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate based on financial
market prices moved down a bit, on net, over the intermeeting period. Early in
the period, policy expectations declined notably in reaction to FOMC
communications following the March meeting, including the larger‐than‐
expected downward revisions to FOMC participants’ March SEP assessments for
the federal funds rate. These declines were partly reversed later in the period as
U.S. and Chinese data were, on balance, stronger than expected and as
sentiment improved regarding trade negotiations between the United States and
China. Compared with the March surveys, respondents to the Desk’s April/May
surveys revised down their federal funds rate projections modestly.
A straight read of the probability distribution of the federal funds rate at the end
of 2019 implied by the most recent quotes on options and not adjusted for risk
premiums (figure 1) suggests that the federal funds rate is most likely to end the
year in the 2 to 2.25 percent range. The probability distribution shows a notable
shift since March towards lower outcomes, leaving only marginal probability on
outcomes above the current target range. By comparison, Desk survey
respondents on average assigned the greatest probability to an unchanged year‐
end target range and judged the odds on higher rates as slightly outweighing
those on lower rates (not shown).
Figure 2 shows how option‐implied policy rate expectations at the six‐month
horizon have evolved since the September 2018 FOMC meeting. The bars depict
the probabilities that the target range six months ahead would be lower (in
blue), unchanged (in yellow), or higher (in red) relative to the target range in
effect just before each meeting. As shown in the leftmost bar, ahead of the
September 2018 meeting markets priced in a higher future policy rate in six
months’ time with virtual certainty. By the time of the January meeting,
however, substantial probability of an unchanged or lower future target range
had emerged. At the January meeting the FOMC indicated it would take a
“patient” approach going forward. Between the January and March meetings,
the implied probability that the policy rate would be unchanged at the six‐month
horizon—which can be interpreted as one measure of perceived patience—rose
significantly. Since March, the implied probability of no change in the target
range has held relatively steady while the odds on lower outcomes have
increased.
Figure 3 compares various measures of the expected federal funds rate over the
next few years. A straight read of forward rates derived from overnight index
swaps (the solid blue line) suggests that the federal funds rate will decline
roughly 20 basis points this year and about 25 basis points in 2020. In contrast,
the latest expected path from a staff term structure model that adjusts for term
premiums (the solid red line) continues to suggest further gradual increases in
sevitanretlA

the federal funds rate of about 20 to 25 basis points per year over the next
several years. The path from the staff’s model beyond 2019 lies notably above
the modal path reported by the median respondent to the Desk’s April/May
surveys (the brown line), which was flat. Relative to the March surveys, the
median respondent no longer anticipates a rate hike by the end of this year as
the modal outcome and expects the target range for the federal funds rate to
remain unchanged through 2021. As shown by the dashed lines in figure 3, both
the unadjusted and adjusted market‐based paths declined somewhat on net,
following more notable declines earlier in the intermeeting period.
Figure 4 shows the median and interquartile range of respondents’ modal federal
funds rate projections from the Desk’s April/May surveys (in blue) relative to the
March surveys (in green). The median projection (the orange bars) declined by
25 basis points at each of the next three year‐ends. The median for the longer‐
run modal projection has remained unchanged. While the interquartile range has
converged on the median for the end of 2019, its width has stayed about
unchanged for the end of 2020 and has expanded for the end of 2021.
Figure 5 shows measures of the longer‐run expected federal funds rate. A
straight read of forward rates at longer horizons implied by Treasury yields (the
blue line) suggests that investors’ current expectation for the average federal
funds rate 5 to 10 years ahead declined a touch further, to about 2.75 percent.
Adjusting for term premiums using various staff term structure models (with the
light‐red‐shaded region showing a range of three such model estimates)
continues to suggest that 5‐to‐10‐year‐ahead expectations are above the
unadjusted forward rates, at between 3.1 and 3.9 percent, consistent with a
negative term premium at those horizons. In contrast, surveys of professional
forecasters project rates closer to the unadjusted forward rates; the average
longer‐run forecast from the December Blue Chip survey (the yellow diamonds)
and the median forecast from the Desk’s April/May surveys (the green diamonds)
are 3.1 and 2.75 percent, respectively.
The Desk’s April/May surveys also asked respondents for their assessments of the
rate of PCE inflation two to three years ahead. Figure 6 shows the average
probability distribution across respondents from the current surveys (the red
bars) together with that from the June 2018 surveys (the black dashed line), the
last time a comparable question was asked. These medium‐term forward PCE
inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, with respondents
continuing to assign the highest average probability to the 1.76 to 2.25 percent
range. Respondents also continue to assign greater odds to the next‐lower
range for PCE inflation (1.26 to 1.75 percent) than to the next‐higher range (2.26‐
2.75 percent). Meanwhile, the median forecast in the survey of primary dealers
for core PCE inflation in 2019 and 2020 has declined by 20 and 4 basis points,
respectively, since the March survey (not shown).

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A
If policymakers judge that the softening in inflation indicates an increased risk of
inflation running persistently below the 2 percent objective, they may want to
communicate that they stand ready to adjust rates. With Alternative A, the Committee
would signal the potential for rate cuts in the near term by stating that, in light of
“softening” inflation, it will “assess whether it may soon become appropriate to adjust the
target range for the federal funds rate.” Under Alternative A, the “patient” language used
in Alternative B would be removed.
Policymakers may judge that solid job growth and gradually firming wage data
indicate that the labor market strengthened at a steady pace over the past few years
without generating a sizable increase in inflation. Meanwhile, recent data suggest that
the growth rates of household and business spending have been slowing from their pace
last year. With inflation already running below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent
objective, policymakers may see significant risks that inflation could fail to return to
2 percent on a sustained basis, particularly if resource utilization were to soften. In this
case, the credibility of the Committee’s commitment to its 2 percent longer-run inflation
objective could be damaged or longer-term inflation expectations may erode.
In addition, policymakers may deem it prudent to emphasize their commitment to
support a sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.
Consequently, Alternative A stresses that adjustments to the target range may be
“appropriate” to support the outcome of “inflation near the Committee’s symmetric
2 percent objective.”
While Alternative A signals an inclination to reduce the target range in the future,
the inclusion of the phrase “assess whether it may soon become appropriate to adjust the
target range” does not lock the Committee into making such an adjustment. Hence, the
Committee may see this communication as reducing the risk of a policy surprise while
preserving optionality for a future rate reduction.
A statement from the Committee such as Alternative A could be seen by market
participants as signaling a more accommodative path for the policy rate than had been
anticipated and market expectations for the federal funds rate would likely fall. If, in
addition, market participants judged Alternative A as indicating a more accommodative
policy reaction function, then equity prices and inflation compensation would likely rise.

The effect on the dollar might be more ambiguous, with lower real rates and higher future
inflation pointing to depreciation, but stronger economic activity suggesting the opposite.
If, by contrast, market participants inferred from Alternative A that the Committee had
lowered its outlook for economic activity and inflation, equity prices would likely fall
together with the exchange value of the dollar, and possibly inflation compensation.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C
Alternative C provides a possible template for a statement the Committee could
consider in circumstances in which the economy continues to perform well and the case
for further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate has materially
strengthened. Because Alternative C is primarily meant to spur thinking on future
statement language in circumstances different from those currently prevailing, it omits
the usual discussion of recent data in the first paragraph. Presumably, at a time when
Alternative C became appropriate, the language of the first paragraph would convey a
view of firming inflation, a strengthening economy, or diminished risks to the outlook; it
is also possible that one or more of these signals would be in postmeeting statements
prior to the removal of the “patient” language.
If policymakers see a growing likelihood for another increase in the target range,
the language characterizing the Committee’s approach as “patient” would need to change.
The March Tealbook offered two possibilities for altering this language. The first was to
simply delete the last sentence of the second paragraph, and the second was to replace
that sentence with the thought that “some further policy firming may become
appropriate.” The current version of Alternative C takes a slightly different approach by
modifying the last sentence of the second paragraph to identify the economic conditions
that may justify a subsequent increase in the target range. In particular, Alternative C
states: “In light of [firmer inflation readings | tightening resource utilization | diminished
risks to the outlook], the Committee will assess whether it may soon become appropriate
to adjust the target range for the federal funds rate.”
Policymakers may see this statement as addressing a need to provide more clarity
about the future course of policy than is given by simply deleting the sentence containing
the “patient” language. While the sentence indicates a bias toward an increase in the
target range in the future, the language does not commit to such an adjustment. As with
Alternative A, the Committee may view this communication as reducing the risk of a
surprise change in policy, while creating optionality for future rate hikes.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
Under any of the Alternatives, the Committee would issue an implementation note
that indicates no change to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates—the interest rate on
required and excess reserve balances, the offering rate on overnight reverse repurchase
agreements, and the primary credit rate. The draft implementation note on the following
pages reflects the Committee’s decision, announced March 20, 2019, to reduce the
monthly cap on Treasury securities redemptions from its current level of $30 billion to
$15 billion beginning May 2019. As usual, struck-out text indicates language deleted
from the March directive and implementation note, bold red underlined text indicates
added language, and blue underlined text indicates text that links to websites.

Implementation Note for May 2019 (all Alternatives)
Release Date: May 1, 2019
Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on March 20,
2019 May 1, 2019:
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ]
to maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at
2.40 percent, effective March 21, 2019 May 2, 2019.
 As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy
directive:
“Effective March 21, 2019 May 2, 2019, the Federal Open Market
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as
necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to
2-1/2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and
reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading
conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts limited only
by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
Effective May 2, 2019, the Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling
over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar
month that exceeds $30 $15 billion. , and The Committee directs the
Desk to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the
amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each
calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these
amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon
swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.”
 In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
voted [ unanimously ] to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate
at the existing level of 3.00 percent.

Balance Sheet and Income Projections
The staff has prepared projections of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the
associated income statement that are consistent with the baseline forecast in Tealbook A.
These projections are substantially revised from those presented in the previous Tealbook
for two principal reasons.
First, the staff’s revised financial projections in Tealbook A imply a much flatter
path for the federal funds rate relative to the March Tealbook, with the short-term policy
rate 140 basis points lower at the end of the medium term, in 2021:Q4. Over the medium
run, the paths for the 10-year Treasury yield and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate are both,
on average, 50 basis points below the March Tealbook projection. As a result of these
revisions to the forecast, the projected path of prepayments from agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) is higher, which induces a steeper pace of decline in SOMA
MBS holdings throughout the projection horizon.
Second, the projections incorporate new policy assumptions regarding the
evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, which embed the Balance Sheet
Normalization Principles and Plans released after the March FOMC meeting. Over the
current quarter and the next, these plans lead to a slower balance sheet runoff, which
comes to a conclusion at the end of September 2019. After this date, the size of the
SOMA portfolio will be held roughly constant for some time, while allowing for gradual
declines in reserves to accommodate growth in currency and other nonreserve liabilities.1
In our projections, we continue to assume that reserve balances will decline until they
reach $1 trillion, which will take place in the fourth quarter of 2021, nearly two years
later than in the March Tealbook.2
1 Runoff of Treasury securities is slowed by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from
$30 billion to $15 billion beginning in May 2019. Beginning in October 2019, proceeds from principal
payments of agency securities will be reinvested in Treasury securities subject to a monthly cap of
$20 billion, with purchases roughly matching the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
Principal payments of agency securities in excess of the monthly cap will continue to be reinvested in
agency MBS.
2 Because reserve balances are expected to reach $1 trillion later than in the previous Tealbook,
and, thus, at a time when nominal GDP is projected to be at a higher level, the size of the balance sheet as a
share of GDP is projected to be slightly smaller over the longer term. However, as discussed in the March
FOMC memo “Transitioning to an Ample Reserves Regime with Lower Reserves,” the actual level at

Evolution of the SOMA portfolio. Under the balance sheet normalization
program initiated in October 2017 and revised in March 2019, cumulative redemptions
are projected to reach $747 billion by the time the reduction in the size of SOMA
holdings concludes at the end of the third quarter. Of this total, redemptions of Treasury
and agency securities will amount to $419 billion and $328 billion, respectively (see the
table in the exhibit “Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments”).
Through the same date, cumulative reinvestments of principal payments in Treasury and
agency securities are projected to be $363 billion and $153 billion, respectively.3
Relative to the March Tealbook, lower redemptions of Treasury securities through the
third quarter of 2019 and the corresponding higher reinvestments reflect the new policy
assumptions for the evolution of the balance sheet. In addition, the projection for
cumulative redemptions of agency securities is $10 billion higher than in the March
Tealbook given the lower projected paths of longer-term interest rates and the resulting
faster pace of MBS prepayments over coming months.
By the time the reduction in total securities holdings concludes at the end
of 2019:Q3, the size of the SOMA portfolio is projected to be slightly above $3.5 trillion,
consisting of about $2.1 trillion of Treasury securities and $1.5 trillion in agency
securities. At that time, the balance sheet is projected to stand at about 17 percent of
nominal GDP, with nonreserve liabilities totaling 11 percent (see the bottom panels of the
exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items”). Starting from the fourth
quarter of 2021, when reserves are projected to reach $1 trillion, the size of the balance
sheet is projected to remain a nearly 16 percent share of GDP.4 For comparison, the size
of the balance sheet as a share of GDP peaked at about 25 percent in the fourth quarter of
2014 and averaged about 5 percent over the decade prior to the crisis. After reserves
reach $1 trillion, SOMA holdings are projected to start rising in line with nominal GDP,
keeping pace with increases in Federal Reserve liabilities and Federal Reserve Bank
capital.
which the decline in reserves ceases will need to be chosen in light of information on banks’ reserve
demand.
3 MBS prepayments are projected to slightly exceed the $20 billion per month redemption cap in
June so that $300 million of reinvestments in agency MBS are projected to occur in that month. However,
the projections for agency MBS are subject to considerable uncertainty because of unscheduled
prepayments. In particular, should longer-term interest rates decline significantly from the current
projected paths, prepayments of MBS are likely to rise and may more frequently exceed the monthly cap of
$20 billion.
4 At that time, the SOMA portfolio is comprised of about $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities and
$1.1 trillion in agency securities.

The share of agency MBS in the SOMA portfolio, which currently stands at
42 percent, is expected to decline somewhat more rapidly than projected in the March
Tealbook, and reach about 19 percent by the end of 2025 given the higher projected pace
of MBS prepayments.
SOMA portfolio characteristics. The weighted-average duration of the SOMA
Treasury portfolio is currently about six and a half years (see the top panel of the exhibit
titled “Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings”).
Duration is projected to edge up to nearly seven years as redemptions continue over this
quarter and the next and longer-duration securities become a larger share of the
portfolio.5 As in the March Tealbook we continue to assume that, once the level of
reserves reaches $1 trillion, all principal payments received on maturing Treasury
securities and on agency securities is entirely reinvested in Treasury bills until the share
of Treasury bills in the Treasury securities portfolio reaches about one-third, close to their
pre-crisis share.6 This process is expected to take about 5 quarters and leads to a sharp
reduction in the weighted-average duration to just over 5 years. Thereafter, further
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum
(see the bottom panel of the exhibit).
Federal Reserve remittances. Remittances to the Treasury are projected to
decline to $49 billion this year from $65 billion in 2018 (see the exhibit “Income
Projections”), mainly reflecting the decline in interest income resulting from the
reduction in SOMA securities holdings.7 Total interest expense is projected to be little
5 Consistent with the Desk’s current practice, these projections assume that rollovers of maturing
Treasury securities will be allocated across newly issued securities at Treasury auctions on a pro-rata basis
in proportion with the amount being issued. Consistent with the Desk’s plans for reinvesting principal
payments from agency debt and MBS into Treasury securities beginning in October 2019, these projections
also assume that these purchases will be made across the Treasury curve during each month. Purchase
amounts will be allocated to sectors in line with the amounts outstanding in those sectors. Secondary-
market purchases of Treasury securities will be distributed across eight sectors for nominal coupon
securities and one sector each for bills, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and Floating Rate
Notes (FRNs). Of note, the share of these purchases allocated to bills will be 15 percent, while the share
allocated to coupon securities with residual maturity shorter than three years will be 41 percent.
6 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operations, the SOMA portfolio currently
contains no Treasury bills.
7 Remittances in 2018 included two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the
statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus. First, $2.5 billion was transferred in February 2018
following an amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018,
enacted in that month. Second, $675 million was transferred in June 2018, reflecting another amendment

changed at $42 billion this year.8 Remittances are expected to increase to $55 billion in
2020. Thereafter, remittances rise reflecting an increase in interest income associated
with a growing balance sheet.
Relative to the previous Tealbook, the projected path for remittances has been
revised up over the next few years and revised down in the longer term. These revisions
reflect the differential effects over time that the revised financial projections have on
interest expense and interest income. Over the medium term, remittances are somewhat
higher than previously projected primarily because the lower path for the interest rate
paid on reserve balances reduces interest expense. In the longer term, this effect is more
than offset by a downward revision to interest income stemming from a shift in the
composition of the portfolio. In particular, the faster pace of prepayments from relatively
higher-yielding MBS results in larger reinvestments into lower-yielding Treasury
securities, thus reducing interest income. As shown in the middle right panel of the
exhibit “Income Projections”, annual remittances are projected to rise gradually from
around 0.25 percent of nominal GDP next year to just below 0.3 percent by the end of the
projection horizon.
Unrealized gains or losses. The SOMA portfolio was in a net unrealized gain
position of about $61 billion at the end of March. The staff estimates that the SOMA
portfolio will be in a net unrealized gain position of about $41 billion at the end of April.9
This amount is attributable to a $53 billion unrealized gain position in Treasury securities
which more than offsets a $13 billion unrealized loss position in agency MBS. With
longer-term interest rates projected to rise, the unrealized gain position is expected to turn
into an unrealized loss position during the second half of 2020. The unrealized loss
position is expected to reach a peak around $86 billion in 2023:Q2. Compared with the
to Section 7 by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in
May 2018.
8 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25-basis-point-wide target range for the federal
funds rate throughout the projection period. Consistent with the FOMC’s December 2018 Implementation
Note, we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will be set 10 basis points below the top of
the target range. We continue to assume that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom
of the range.
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “What Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to be in an
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (June 2018) for an explanation of the accounting notions of unrealized and
realized gain and loss positions, as well as their implications for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its
obligations.

March Tealbook, the path for the unrealized position of the SOMA portfolio is generally
higher reflecting the lower projections for longer-term interest rates.
Total term premium effect: SOMA securities holdings are estimated to be
reducing the term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasury yield by about 131 basis
points in the current quarter (see the exhibit “Projections for the 10-year Treasury Total
Term Premium Effect”). Relative to the March projection, the level of this total term
premium effect (TTPE) is slightly more negative over the coming year, but it is slightly
less negative over the longer term.
Over the next year, the downward effect on the TTPE resulting from the slower
pace of securities redemptions and larger SOMA holdings more than offsets the upward
effect stemming from faster MBS prepayments due to the revised financial assumptions,
thereby leading to a slightly more negative TTPE. However, by the end of 2021, the
effect of the slower pace of securities redemptions fades, and, through the end of the
projection horizon, a slightly less negative TTPE results from the projected more rapid
shift in the composition of the portfolio from MBS towards Treasury securities arising
from the lower path for longer-term interest rates.10,11
10 The lower path of longer-term interest rates, which induces faster MBS prepayments and higher
reinvestments of MBS proceeds into Treasury securities, leads to a shift in the composition of the portfolio
from MBS towards Treasury securities. Shifts of such nature reduce the projected magnitude of the TTPE,
because in the term-structure model on which the TTPE estimates are based MBS holdings are measured at
par value, whereas Treasury securities are measured on a 10-year equivalents basis.
11 The slightly less negative path of the TTPE is also due, in part, to the smaller size of the balance
sheet relative to GDP in the longer run.
