Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The information received since the June Tealbook suggests that economic activity D
n
expanded at a solid pace of 2¾ percent in the first half of the year, led by strong gains in o
c
E
consumer spending and government purchases.1 In addition, payroll gains rebounded in c
ti
s
June from a weak May reading and posted solid gains, on average, in the second quarter, e
m
while the unemployment rate moved lower, on net, last quarter. However, growth of o
D
business investment has slowed noticeably, and most indicators of investment spending
remain downbeat. We expect GDP growth to step down to a 1¾ percent pace in the
second half, as government spending moderates and business investment is held down by
trade tensions and concerns about global growth. Relative to the June Tealbook, GDP
growth in the first half is revised up nearly ½ percentage point, boosted primarily by
better-than-expected retail sales reports, while second-half growth is essentially
unrevised.
We expect that real activity will decelerate further after this year, largely
reflecting the waning impetus from fiscal policy. In addition, we anticipate that concerns
about trade policy and global growth will continue to weigh on the level of aggregate
demand throughout the projection period. Specifically, after slowing from 3 percent in
2018 to 2¼ percent this year, GDP growth is projected to be 2 percent in 2020 and
1¾ percent in 2021. With GDP growth outpacing its potential rate through 2020, the
output gap is projected to widen a bit to nearly 2½ percent by the end of next year and
then narrow slightly to 2¼ percent in 2021, when GDP growth slips below its potential
rate. Accordingly, the unemployment rate is projected to edge down from 3.7 percent at
the end of this year to 3.6 percent next year, 1 percentage point below our estimate of its
natural rate, and then to stay at that level through the end of 2021.
Relative to the June Tealbook, GDP growth is revised up this year, reflecting the
incoming spending data. Our financial assumptions are a little more accommodative than
in June, and we have revised up our medium-term growth projection slightly in response.
1 The BEA will release the advance estimate of second-quarter GDP growth and five years of
revised NIPA data on July 26. We will incorporate the revised data in our usual pre-FOMC forecast
update. On the first day of the FOMC meeting, the BEA will release PCE prices for June.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
&
l
e
v The staff’s projection for GDP growth in 2019 is well aligned with the projections from both the
e
D
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus, but it is about ½ percentage
n
o point higher than the Blue Chip in 2020. Correspondingly, the staff’s unemployment rate forecast is
c
E close to the SPF and Blue Chip projections in 2019 but below the Blue Chip forecast in 2020.
c
ti
s
e With regard to core PCE price inflation, the staff projection is 0.2 percentage point above the SPF
m
projection in 2019. Otherwise, the staff’s inflation projections are close to those of the Blue Chip and
o
D the SPF.

t l On average, the output gap is about ¼ percentage point wider than in our previous
u
O
projection, while the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point lower.
&
l
e
v
e We now estimate that the 12-month change in core PCE prices rose from
D
n 1.5 percent in March to 1.7 percent in June, consistent with our assessment that the weak
o
c
E monthly inflation readings seen earlier this year would be transitory. We expect the
c
ti
s 12-month change to rise further and be 1.9 percent at the end of the year. These figures
e
m
are 0.1 percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook, reflecting incoming data that
o
D
were, on balance, a little above our expectations. For the medium term, we now expect
core PCE inflation to remain at 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, as tight resource utilization
holds inflation slightly above our estimate of its underlying pace. Total PCE price
inflation is forecast to run a bit below core inflation over the forecast period because of
the projected downward-sloping path of oil prices.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Note: The financial assumptions underlying the Tealbook projection are
conditioned on financial market data through 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, July 17. The
effects of any subsequent market moves will be incorporated into our usual pre-FOMC
forecast update on July 26.
Monetary Policy
 The baseline policy rule calls for the federal funds rate to hold flat at
2.4 percent this year and then edge up to 2.7 percent by the end of 2021. In
contrast, term-premium-adjusted market quotes suggest that market
participants expect the federal funds rate to decline roughly 50 basis points by
the end of 2020, with most of the decline occurring this year.
 Our assumptions for the SOMA portfolio, which will be detailed in the
Balance Sheet and Income Projections section of Tealbook B, imply that
downward pressure on the term premium in Treasury yields diminishes over
time.
Other Interest Rates
 We project that the 10-year Treasury yield will rise from an average of
2.1 percent this quarter to 2.9 percent by the end of 2021, largely reflecting
our assumption that the term premium will increase toward a more normal
Page 4 of 120

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 19, 2019
k
o
o
level during the next few years. On average, the 10-year Treasury yield is t l
u
O
15 basis points lower than we had projected in June, as we now assume that
&
the downward pressure on term premiums from global growth concerns, e l
v
e
prospective foreign monetary policy actions, and uncertainty regarding D
n
international trade will be more persistent. o
c
E
c
 The spread of the triple-B corporate bond yield over the 10-year Treasury s
ti
e
m
yield has decreased more than we had previously assumed, and we revised
o
D
down the path for the triple-B yield by more than the Treasury yield. By
contrast, mortgage rate spreads have widened, and we revised down the path
for mortgage rates by a bit less than the 10-year Treasury rate.
Equity Prices
 Stock prices have increased 5.4 percent since the time of the June Tealbook,
with some of the gains apparently supported by expectations of more
accommodative monetary policy. As market expectations for the federal
funds rate are assumed to converge toward our policy path, we expect
essentially no further appreciation in stock prices over the medium term,
compared with 2 percent per year in our June projection. All told, by the end
of 2021, equity prices are little revised.
Trade Policy
 At the G-20 Leaders Summit at the end of June, Presidents Trump and Xi
agreed to restart trade negotiations and to postpone additional broad-based
tariff increases indefinitely; however, they did not alter the tariffs already in
place, including the 15 percentage point tariff increase on $180 billion of
imports from China that occurred on May 10.
 On Friday, June 7, after the close of the June Tealbook, the United States
removed the threat of additional tariffs on imports from Mexico after the two
countries reached an agreement to limit migration from Central America.
 Notwithstanding these developments, trade policy will likely remain a focus
of attention and a significant source of uncertainty for the economic outlook.

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar t l
u
O
 We estimate that foreign real GDP growth stepped up from 1½ percent in the &
l
first quarter to 2 percent in the second quarter, a pace still below our estimate e
v
e
of potential growth. Much of the second-quarter step-up in growth comes D
n
o
from a rebound in Canada and some recovery in Mexico and South America. c
E
However, growth in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and China slowed, c
ti
s
and our overall estimate of foreign growth has been revised slightly lower in e
m
o
the first half of this year. Although we forecast foreign growth to pick up to D
about 2½ percent by next year, supported by very accommodative monetary
policy, the outlook remains murky.
 Since the June Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has depreciated about
1 percent, with somewhat more depreciation against EME currencies. From a
lower starting point, the broad real dollar is projected to appreciate at an
annual rate of 1.2 percent, a bit faster than in the June Tealbook, reflecting our
revised expectations for more accommodative monetary policy in the AFEs.
All told, the broad real dollar is revised slightly lower by 2021.
Fiscal Policy
 We assume that fiscal policymakers will lift the discretionary spending caps,
as they have in recent years, so that the current level of discretionary federal
spending will be maintained in real terms through 2021. To lift the caps for
fiscal year 2020, policymakers will need to enact legislation before the fiscal
year begins on October 1.2
 Under these policy assumptions, the direct fiscal impetus from all levels of
government contributes 0.7 percentage point to the growth rate in aggregate
demand this year—about the same as in 2018—before tapering to
0.4 percentage point in 2020 and 0.2 percentage point in 2021.3
2 The federal government is currently in a debt issuance suspension period. Absent additional
borrowing authority, we expect that the debt limit will most likely be breached in the first week of October,
although there is a significant risk that the limit could be breached in early September. We continue to
assume that policymakers will raise the statutory debt limit before the breach date.
3 If appropriations were to return to the lower levels of the budget caps later this year, we estimate
that the level of GDP would be about ½ percent lower at the end of 2021.

t l  We expect the federal budget deficit, which was 4 percent of GDP in fiscal
u
O
2018, to widen to 4½ percent this fiscal year and to remain at about that level
&
e l through the end of the medium term. Federal debt held by the public is
v
e
D projected to rise from 78 percent of GDP in fiscal 2018 to 81 percent of GDP
n
o by the end of the medium term.

c
ti
s Oil Prices
e
m
o  The spot price of Brent crude oil is up about $3 per barrel from the June
D
Tealbook, closing most recently at $64 per barrel. Farther-dated futures prices
are up by a similar amount, and the futures curve continues to slope down
modestly. Tensions with Iran and the nine-month extension of an OPEC
agreement to keep production low contributed to the higher oil prices.
However, the upward pressure on prices has likely been muted by continued
concerns about the outlook for global growth.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP
We estimate that real GDP growth slowed from about 3 percent in the first quarter
to 2½ percent in the second, reflecting a sharp step-down in the growth of business fixed
investment (BFI) and the reversal of substantial boosts to first-quarter growth from net
exports and inventory investment. These second-quarter drags more than offset a strong
rebound in consumer spending growth and a bounceback in federal purchases following
the government shutdown. Compared with the June Tealbook, we have revised up our
forecast for second-quarter GDP growth ¾ percentage point, primarily reflecting the
positive news on consumption. We project GDP growth to slow from 2¾ percent in the
first half to 1¾ percent in the second half, as infrastructure investment by state and local
governments declines and business investment remains sluggish amid ongoing concerns
about trade tensions and global growth; in contrast, growth in consumer spending is
projected to continue at about its first-half pace.4
 Growth in consumer spending appears to have picked up in the second quarter
by more than we had previously expected, as the May and June readings for
retail sales and June data for motor vehicle sales surprised us to the upside. In
4 We now assume that Midwest flooding has been holding down farm-sector output and will
reduce GDP growth this year by 0.1 percentage point. We continue to assume that production disruptions
for the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will deduct less than 0.1 percentage point from GDP growth this year.

o
the near term, favorable sentiment and gains in labor income should continue t l
u
O
to support spending, and we project PCE growth of 2.5 percent in the second
&
half of the year, the same as the average pace in the first half. e l
v
e
D
 The outlook for BFI remains weak. After rising 7 percent last year and at a n
o
c
4½ percent pace in the first quarter, BFI is expected to be about unchanged E
c
through the end of this year. The box “The Weak Outlook for Business Fixed s
ti
e
m
Investment” discusses our forecast for BFI in more detail.
o
D
 We estimate that residential investment continued to contract through the first
half of 2019, but we anticipate that the recent decline in mortgage rates will
result in a modest upturn in housing activity in the second half. The
information received since the June Tealbook is generally supportive of this
projection: Sales of new and existing homes have moved up so far this year,
and construction permits for single-family houses moved a little higher in
May and June after having declined steadily since September of last year.
 Manufacturing production increased in May and June, led by a rebound in the
production of motor vehicles and parts. Nevertheless, over the first half of the
year, factory output declined at an annual rate of 2¼ percent on net. Looking
ahead, we expect some further gains in vehicle production; however,
excluding motor vehicles, we anticipate that factory output will remain soft in
the second half, as indexes of new orders from manufacturing surveys remain
subdued, BFI has decelerated, and trade policy concerns are still elevated.
 We estimate that, on balance, net exports provided a modest positive
contribution to U.S. GDP growth in the first half of the year. Although export
growth was depressed by the suspension of exports of the Boeing 737 MAX
aircraft, goods imports declined following substantial strength in late 2018.
We expect that net exports will be neutral for GDP growth in the second half.
 Growth in government purchases was unusually strong in the first half, partly
reflecting a blistering 25 percent rate of increase in state and local government
infrastructure investment that is expected to partially unwind over the

The Weak Outlook for Business Fixed Investment
&
l
e
v Growth of business fixed investment (BFI) slowed from a brisk 7 percent pace in 2018 to an
e
D
estimated 2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year. At the same time, the tenor of a wide
n
o array of indicators that inform our investment outlook has become decidedly more downbeat,
c
E
leading us to project no growth in BFI over the second half of the year.
c
ti
s
e
As shown in figure 1, the slowdown in 2019:H1 is centered in equipment investment (blue bars),
m
o which appears to have moved sideways over this period: Nominal shipments of nondefense
D
capital goods (excluding aircraft) have been roughly flat since late last year, while capital goods
imports have turned down. Moreover, new orders for capital goods have gradually moved down
and now stand well below shipments, indicating little impetus to equipment spending in coming
months.
Investment in drilling and mining structures (green bars) has declined in response to lower oil
prices, and we expect it will decline further, reflecting the staff’s projected oil price path.
Investment in other nonresidential structures (yellow bars) has also been lackluster, and a recent
drop in architectural billings (not shown) points to further weakness ahead. In contrast,
investment in intellectual property (red bars) like software and R&D has remained solid.
We expect BFI to be little changed in the second half of the year and then to rise modestly over
the medium term. Some slowing in BFI growth this year would be consistent with the staff’s
outlook for output growth and interest rates.1 However, our forecast is weaker than what is
implied by those two forces alone, as it reflects our reaction to a number of additional factors.
Two factors that are modest drags on our projection for BFI are the delayed deliveries of the
Boeing 737 Max and the direct effect of currently imposed tariffs.
A more significant factor is heightened concern over trade policy, which has likely contributed to
softer business sentiment (figure 2) and a pullback in capital spending plans. The ISM
1 The staff currently estimates that the 2017 tax cuts boosted BFI growth about ¾ percentage point in 2018
and will contribute a similar amount in 2019. However, the strength in BFI last year and the slowdown this year
could suggest more front‐loaded effects from the tax cuts than we assumed.

manufacturing (black line) and nonmanufacturing (blue line) composite indexes are down since O
last year, while the Philadelphia Fed general activity index (red line) has been volatile, dropping in &
l
June and popping back up in July. Most other regional Fed manufacturing surveys and indicators e
v
e
from private sources, such as the Markit and Duke CFO surveys, have also weakened somewhat.
D
n
o
Beige Book commentary tying concerns about trade policy to reduced investment plans has c
E
become increasingly prevalent. More anecdotes in business surveys have linked a weaker c
ti
outlook for economic activity and capital expenditures to recent tariff actions and increased s
e
m
trade tensions. And measures of economic policy uncertainty and the staff’s trade policy
o
uncertainty index have soared. However, corporate bond spreads and the VIX—which also proxy D
for business uncertainty—remain historically low, and financing conditions more generally still
appear accommodative for businesses.2
Finally, analysts’ expectations for longer‐term profits growth, shown in figure 3, have
deteriorated sharply and reversed the run‐up that followed the enactment of the 2017 tax cuts.
Some of the decline could be related to those tax changes—growth expectations should slow
once profits reach a permanently higher level—but we think such a slowing would unfold more
gradually. Instead, we think the recent deterioration in profit expectations more likely reflects
other factors like the escalation in trade tensions and concerns about the global outlook.
As shown in figure 4, including profit expectations in our workhorse investment model for
equipment and intangibles (E&I) improves its fit and implies a more pessimistic investment
outlook this year.3 The model improvement likely reflects the forward‐looking nature of profit
expectations and their ability to capture unobserved “animal spirits,” an influence that is largely
absent from our measures of business output and the user cost.4 All told, the diverse set of
factors previously mentioned suggest that BFI will remain anemic this year.
2 The uncertainty measures based on news articles or other text sources are more volatile and appear to
have less predictive power for BFI than do the uncertainty proxies based on financial markets.
3 We project E&I investment growth this year to be between the two models, consistent with the experience
in 2018.
4 Our model takes more signal from changes in this series than from its level. Large changes may capture
major shocks to profitability that are not reflected in other investment fundamentals.

u
O
contributes ½ percentage point to the second-half deceleration in GDP.
&
l
e
v
e After increasing 2¼ percent this year, real GDP growth is projected to slow to
D
n 2 percent in 2020 and 1¾ percent in 2021. This gradual deceleration reflects the waning
o
c
E impetus from fiscal policy and, to a lesser extent, the lagged effects of the earlier removal
c
s
ti
of monetary accommodation. Although this forecast is conditioned on slightly lower
e
m
interest rates through 2021 due to a downward revision to the projected term premium,
o
D
we think that some of the factors that have pushed down the term premium recently—
most notably, global growth concerns and uncertainty regarding trade policy—will also
weigh more persistently on economic activity than we had previously expected. Thus,
although we have revised up GDP growth about ¼ percentage point this year in response
to incoming data, growth over 2020 and 2021 is revised up just a touch.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
The labor market has continued to tighten so far this year but at a more gradual
pace than in 2018. Job gains have been solid, on average, and the unemployment rate has
moved lower, on net, from late last year. Looking ahead, we expect payroll gains to slow
further over the medium term and the labor market to tighten only a little further.
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 224,000 in June following gains of 72,000 in May
and 216,000 in April. On average, these readings are a little higher than what
we expected in the June Tealbook and well above the monthly gains of 90,000
to 120,000 that we estimate are needed to keep labor utilization constant.6
With GDP projected to decelerate over the medium term, we expect payroll
gains to slow from an average monthly pace of 155,000 in the second half of
this year to about 110,000 in 2021.
o Private nonfarm payrolls, both as reported by the BLS and based on the
staff’s measure that is derived from microdata from the payroll-processing
5 The increase in infrastructure investment may reflect latent demand, as these expenditures have
been quite subdued for many years. Moreover, in recent years, a majority of states have legislated
increases in their motor fuel taxes, which are generally earmarked for transportation infrastructure.
However, in part because infrastructure investment tends to be very volatile, we expect it to drop back
somewhat over the rest of the year.
6 This is the range that would be, on average, consistent with no change in the unemployment rate
and a decline in the participation rate in line with its trend over the next year.

 The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent in June from 3.6 percent in e

o
c
Looking ahead, we expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7 percent E
c
through year-end and then to edge down to 3.6 percent in early 2020. In 2020 s
ti
e
m
and 2021, the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point below the June
o
D
Tealbook projection, reflecting the wider output gap in this projection.
 The LFPR edged up to 62.9 percent in June from 62.8 percent in the previous
two months. The LFPR has moved in a wide range over the past year but has
been little changed on net. When judged against its aging-related downward
trend, an unchanged LFPR represents a modest tightening in labor market
utilization. We expect some further tightening along this margin, as the LFPR
remains flat through 2020 and then starts to edge down in 2021.
 We estimate that output per hour in the business sector increased at an average
annual rate of 3½ percent in the first half of this year after having increased at
a 1¾ percent pace in 2018. This recent surge likely overstates the true gains
in productivity, as it reflects in large part a steep decline in a poorly measured
and volatile component of aggregate hours. Moreover, with GDI growth
looking weaker than GDP growth early this year, it is also possible that output
growth was overstated. Given these factors, we have not yet taken much
signal from the strong readings on productivity for our medium-term
projection.7 With productivity expected to post a small decline in the second
half (largely reflecting a partial reversal of the unusual hours movements), we
project productivity to rise about 1½ percent this year, about ¼ percentage
point faster than both our previous projection and its structural rate. We
continue to expect that productivity growth will slow further in 2020 and 2021
to a pace slightly below its structural rate, as the tight labor market continues
to draw in workers with lower-than-average skills.
7 We will revisit our assumptions for structural productivity and other components of the supply
side in the September Tealbook after we have digested the implications of the upcoming NIPA annual
revisions.

t l THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
u
O
&
Core PCE inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 percent through the medium term,
l
e
v
e a little above our estimate of its underlying pace of 1.8 percent, as the effects of tight
D
n resource utilization more than offset a slight drag from import prices that emerges after
o
c
E this year. (The box “The Unemployment Rate Consistent with 2 Percent Inflation”
c
ti
provides a simple calculation of the unemployment rate needed to achieve a 2 percent
s
e
m
inflation rate given our estimate of underlying inflation.) With energy prices expected to
o
D
edge down over the forecast period, total PCE inflation is projected to run just a little
below core inflation through 2021.
 Monthly increases in core PCE prices stepped up noticeably in the second
quarter from their transitorily low first-quarter readings; as a result, the
12-month change in core PCE prices, which had dipped to 1.5 percent in
March, is estimated to have moved up to 1.7 percent in June. The 12-month
change is then expected to rise to 1.9 percent in August, as last August’s
particularly weak reading drops out of the calculation, and to remain at
1.9 percent through December. Core inflation in the second half is also
boosted by the pass-through of this May’s tariff increases.
o The incoming monthly inflation data, including the CPI and PPI for
May and June and PCE prices through May, were, on balance, a little
above our expectations in the June Tealbook. However, the upside
surprises were concentrated in the volatile nonmarket category of PCE
prices, which tends to have little signal for future price changes.
Accordingly, we did not materially change our forecast for monthly
price increases in the second half of this year; the resulting 12-month
changes in core PCE prices are 0.1 percentage point higher than in the
June Tealbook.
o We estimate that total PCE prices rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months
ending in June, and we expect this measure of inflation to increase to
1.8 percent in December. In addition to the anticipated step-up in core
inflation, we expect food prices to rise more rapidly in the second half
of the year, driven by recent increases in livestock and crop
commodity prices.

 We estimate that the effective price for imported core goods (which includes t l
u
O
the effect of tariffs) rose 0.6 percent in the first half of the year, somewhat less
&
l
than we expected in the June Tealbook, as falling prices for imported foods e
v
e
and industrial supplies, particularly metals, partially offset a boost from the D
n
most recent increase in tariffs on imports from China.8 For the second half of o
c
E
the year, we expect effective core import price inflation to step up to c
ti
s
2.3 percent as tariff effects continue to be felt and the drag from falling metals e
m
prices wanes. After this year, core import price inflation averages 0.9 percent, o
D
reflecting moderate foreign inflation and an appreciating dollar.
 The preliminary July reading of median long-run inflation expectations from
the University of Michigan moved up to 2.6 percent from 2.3 percent in June.
After drifting lower over 2015 and 2016, this measure has moved sideways
since then, fluctuating around 2.5 percent.
o In the current projection, we have maintained our view that underlying
inflation is 1.8 percent and that it will hold steady at this level over the
medium term. This assumption is informed by estimates of underlying
inflation obtained from a variety of statistical models, some of which
incorporate information on inflation expectations.
We continue to expect increases in hourly compensation to remain moderate over
the medium term. The employment cost index (ECI) is projected to rise 2¾ percent per
year, close to the average pace over the past couple of years. In contrast, we project that
compensation per hour in the business sector, which is more cyclically sensitive than the
ECI (and also noisier), will step up from around 3 percent this year to around 3½ percent
next year, as this year’s particularly low first-quarter reading is not repeated.
 Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in June,
about as projected in the June Tealbook, and we expect the 12-month change
will remain between 3 and 3¼ percent over the coming months.9
8 The estimated boost to effective import price inflation from the May 10 increase in tariffs is
spread over the second and third quarters.
9 The BLS will release the June estimate of the ECI on the second day of the FOMC meeting.

The Unemployment Rate Consistent with 2 Percent Inflation
&
l
e The staff assesses that underlying inflation—the rate of inflation that will prevail when the
v
e unemployment rate is equal to its natural rate, when relative prices of imports and energy remain
D
n unchanged, and when there are no other price shocks—is currently 1.8 percent. If underlying
o
c inflation were to remain unchanged at this level, what unemployment rate would be consistent
E
c with PCE price inflation running at the Committee’s 2 percent objective?1
ti
s
e
m
To answer this question, we use a stylized Phillips curve model that closely mimics the staff’s
o
D judgmental inflation framework. This framework is summarized by equation (1), which relates
core inflation ( ) to its own lag, underlying inflation ( the difference between the
unemployment rate and the natural rate , chan∗ges in core import prices and energy
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1),
prices relative to core PCE prices, and other shock∗s ( ):
(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡)
εt
∗ ∗
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1+ (1−𝛼𝛼)𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1− 𝛽𝛽(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡)+ 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎+ εt. (1)
For any given rate of underlying inflation ( and no changes in relative prices or other shocks,
we can calculate the unemployment rate co∗nsistent with 2 percent inflation as
𝜋𝜋 )
∗ 1−𝛼𝛼 ∗
𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 − (2−𝜋𝜋 ). (2)
𝛽𝛽
The factors that determine the difference between the unemployment rate consistent with
2 percent and the natural rate are α, which captures the persistence of inflation; β, the “slope” of
the Phillips curve; and the wedge between the underlying rate of inflation and 2 percent. Setting
the parameters in equation (2) to be consistent with those in the staff’s judgmental forecast—α
is 0.3; β is 0.12—the resulting unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, noticeably below the staff’s
natural rate of 4.6 percent.2
Of course, this estimate must be viewed with caution, given the uncertainty around the true
inflation process and the fact that this process could change over time, particularly if
unemployment were to remain persistently very low. For example, some model estimates
suggest that the Phillips curve could be flatter than we have assumed. If we assumed that β were
0.06, the unemployment rate would need to be even lower—around 2¼ percent—to achieve
2 percent inflation. Alternatively, the Phillips curve could be nonlinear, with a slope at low levels
of unemployment that is considerably steeper than we have assumed, which would raise the
required unemployment rate. Or underlying inflation could move up or down, pushing the
required unemployment rate up or down at the same time.3
1 In the staff’s projection, underlying inflation holds at 1.8 percent through 2021 but eventually moves up
to 2 percent.
2 In the staff projection, import prices are expected to rise more slowly than core PCE prices, on average,
in 2020 and 2021, exerting about a 0.1 percentage point drag on core PCE price inflation. Thus, in our medium-
term projection, the unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent PCE price inflation is lower than 3.4 percent.
3 In fact, if underlying inflation became more sensitive to past inflation, as in an accelerationist Phillips
curve, then the inflation objective could be sustainably achieved only with the unemployment rate equal to the
natural rate, as holding the unemployment rate below the natural rate would lead to persistently rising inflation.

 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will remain at
l
e
v
e 4.6 percent. We also still assume that potential output growth will slow after
D
n 2021 to 1.7 percent per year in the longer run, as the boost to potential growth
o
c
E from the 2017 tax cuts wanes.
c
ti
s
e
m  We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equilibrium federal
o
D funds rate will be 0.5 percent. The nominal yield on 10-year Treasury
securities is 3.4 percent in the longer run.
o We continue to assume that fiscal policymakers will eventually start to
gradually reduce primary deficits by an amount sufficient to stabilize
the debt-to-GDP ratio. We expect this ratio to level off at around
105 percent, 20 percentage points higher than would have occurred in
the absence of the 2017–18 federal tax and discretionary spending
changes and our assumption that the spending caps will not go back in
place this year. We also still assume that this 20 percentage point
increment to the debt-to-GDP ratio will push up the term premium on
10-year Treasury yields 50 basis points in the long run.
 GDP growth slows from 1.8 percent in 2021 to 1.3 percent in 2024, as
monetary policy provides some restraint and the contribution from fiscal
policy fades a little further. The unemployment rate moves up gradually from
3.6 percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural rate in subsequent
years. Core PCE price inflation moves up from 1.9 percent in 2021 to
2.0 percent by 2023.
 Given the outlook for inflation and resource utilization, the nominal federal
funds rate remains around 2.7 percent from the end of the medium term
through 2024, and it declines slowly to its long-run value of 2.5 percent
thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The outlook for the global economy remains murky. Incoming data are consistent
with a pickup in foreign economic growth last quarter from its very subdued pace earlier
this year, but growth likely remained below its potential pace. Moreover, activity
indicators have been a bit weaker than expected, leading us to revise down modestly our
estimate of growth in the first half of this year. Given concerns about the global outlook
and little underlying inflation pressure, we expect foreign central banks to pursue more
accommodative monetary policies than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook.
k
o
o
l
We estimate that growth abroad increased to an annual rate of 2.0 percent in the t
u
O
second quarter from the 1.5 percent pace observed in the previous two quarters but &
l
remained below its estimated potential pace of 2.4 percent. Nevertheless, we are not sure e
v
e
that the global economy has made it out of its soft patch. The pickup in growth is D
n
o
concentrated in Canada and, to a lesser extent, Mexico (countries that have a particularly
c
E
large imprint on our trade-weighted measure of foreign growth). In addition, global ’ l
t
n
manufacturing remains depressed, with Germany showing particular weakness and only I
sparse positive signs elsewhere.
We expect foreign growth to edge up to a pace close to its potential by early next
year, with growth stabilizing in advanced foreign economies (AFEs), being supported by
accommodative monetary policy, and rising in emerging market economies (EMEs) due,
in part, to an improvement in the high-tech sector. However, this outlook is hardly
assured. Most notably, the global slide in the manufacturing sector may extend further,
perhaps because the elevated uncertainty around trade policies could weigh on
investment to a greater degree than we have assumed in our baseline outlook. Moreover,
trade tensions could escalate, with the United States imposing additional tariffs on
imports from China and Mexico and on automobile imports. We explore both of these
scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section. We also anticipate a resurfacing of risks
surrounding a “no deal” Brexit in the fall.
Foreign inflation is estimated to have stepped up in the second quarter, reflecting
an acceleration in energy prices as well as EME food prices. In the AFEs, underlying
inflation continues to be low, with 12-month core inflation in the euro area and Japan still
far below central bank targets. Against the backdrop of muted inflation pressures,
subdued GDP growth, and pronounced risks to the global outlook, we foresee a more
Page 35 of 120

--- Page 39 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 19, 2019
accommodative foreign monetary policy stance. We expect the European Central Bank
(ECB) to cut its deposit rate in September and to resume its large-scale asset purchase
program later this year. We also pushed back our assumptions for the timing of further
rate hikes by the Bank of Canada (BOC) and Bank of England (BOE) and now expect
shallower tightening cycles over the forecast period. In the EMEs, several central banks,
including Chile, India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Korea, have cut policy rates, and
others have adopted more dovish rhetoric.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
k • Euro Area. Recent indicators continue to point to lackluster growth. Industrial
o
o
l production through May and PMIs through June suggest that GDP growth slowed to
t
u
O
1 percent in the second quarter from 1.6 percent in the first. The slowdown partly
&
l reflected the tapering of temporary factors that had boosted growth earlier, such as a
e
v
e
D partial payback in car production from the slump in the second half of 2018, but also
n
o continuing weakness in German manufacturing. Given the weak underlying
c
E
momentum, we expect growth to edge up only slightly later this year and to pick up a
l
’
t
n
I bit more appreciably thereafter, rising to 1.8 percent (above potential) in 2021.
Relative to the June Tealbook, we revised down our estimate for the second quarter
0.2 percentage point in light of modestly disappointing data but marked up our
forecast for 2020 and 2021 a touch, in line with our assumption for more
accommodative monetary policy.
Headline inflation on a 12-month basis was 1.3 percent in June, while core inflation
was 1.1 percent. Going forward, we expect inflation to reach only 1.4 percent in
2021, even as the output gap closes. Given the subdued outlook for inflation and lack
of momentum in growth, we now expect the ECB to cut its deposit rate by 20 basis
points in September (to negative 0.6 percent) and to restart its asset purchase program
in the fourth quarter, purchasing €30 billion per month through the end of 2020. We
also project that the deposit rate will remain negative throughout the forecast period,
ending 2021 at negative 0.5 percent, 0.5 percentage point lower than assumed in the
June Tealbook.
• United Kingdom. Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on economic activity. We
estimate that real GDP contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter, following a
2 percent expansion in the first. This estimate is 0.9 percentage point weaker than in
the June Tealbook, reflecting a larger-than-expected reversal from the pre-Brexit
Page 36 of 120

--- Page 40 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 19, 2019
stockpiling that had boosted growth in the first quarter as well as temporary
shutdowns by several car manufacturers. Amid elevated political uncertainties,
growth should remain relatively subdued, averaging a modest 1.3 percent in the
second half of the year. Although the risk of a no-deal Brexit has materially
increased (and other outcomes, such as another extension or a reversal of Brexit, are
still on the table), our outlook assumes an orderly Brexit in the fourth quarter,
followed by a long transition period. Accordingly, with uncertainty gradually fading
and monetary policy remaining accommodative, we project that growth will pick up a
bit and settle at 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2021, about its potential rate.
k
Headline 12-month inflation stayed at 2 percent in June, while core inflation was only o
o
l
1.7 percent. With the BOE’s recent communications citing elevated downside risks t
u
O
to the growth outlook, we now assume a more accommodative path for monetary
&
l
policy. We expect the policy rate to rise from its current rate of 0.75 percent to only e
v
e
1 percent by early 2021 and stay at that level thereafter, 0.5 percentage point lower D
n
than in the June Tealbook. o
c
E
l
’
t
• Japan. After strong growth in the first quarter, indicators suggest that real GDP was n
I
about flat in the second, as a surge in private consumption was offset by a rebound in
imports. Looking through the volatility from the consumption tax hike scheduled for
October, we expect GDP growth to be near zero in the second half of the year. Over
the next two years, we see GDP growth slightly above its potential pace of
0.7 percent, supported by additional spending related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
and very accommodative monetary policy.
The 12-month changes in total and core CPI edged down to 0.8 percent and
0.3 percent, respectively, in May. After the boost provided by the upcoming tax hike,
we expect total inflation to stabilize at 1 percent in 2021. With underlying inflation
still quite far from the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) 2 percent inflation target, we expect the
BOJ to keep its deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent and to continue to purchase assets
to keep the 10-year sovereign yield around the current target of zero percent
throughout the forecast period.
• Canada. After a soft patch around the turn of the year due to temporary cutbacks in
oil production, we estimate that growth picked up in the second quarter as oil
production rebounded. Recent data, notably monthly GDP for April, suggest that real
GDP growth was 2.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 0.4 percent pace
Page 37 of 120

--- Page 41 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 19, 2019
in the first. We expect growth to average 1.7 percent over the forecast period.
Relative to the June Tealbook, we revised up a touch our outlook in the second and
third quarters because of better-than-expected incoming data.
In June, 12-month inflation slowed to the BOC’s 2 percent target, and we expect it to
hover around that rate over the remainder of the forecast period. At its July meeting,
the BOC kept its policy rate unchanged at 1.75 percent but highlighted downside
risks, including elevated trade tensions. Accordingly, we now expect the next rate
hike to occur in mid-2021, compared with late 2020 in our June forecast.
k EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
o
o
l
t
u
O • China. China’s GDP growth slowed sharply to 5.6 percent in the second quarter,
&
from 7.3 percent in the first. Much of this slowdown was expected and reflected
l
e
v
e payback from a spike in industrial production in the first quarter, which may have
D
n been related to changes in tax policy. But contractions in exports and imports and a
o
c
E manufacturing PMI below 50 also portray an economy facing lackluster demand,
l
’
t
n possibly as a result of the trade tensions with the United States. Although retail sales
I
for June strengthened, that pickup was boosted by a one-off surge in auto sales as car
dealers discounted prices ahead of a change in auto emission standards. A pickup in
credit growth in June, however, suggests that the authorities are cautiously stepping
up policy support, and we see growth edging up to 5.8 percent in the second half of
the year. For 2019 as a whole, year-on-year growth is expected to be 6.2 percent,
within the government’s target range of 6 to 6.5 percent, and also about in line with
our admittedly tenuous estimates of potential growth.
• Other Emerging Asia. Incoming data point to a softer-than-expected recovery in the
second quarter. We now estimate that real GDP growth picked up from 2.4 percent in
the first quarter to 2.8 percent in the second, 0.3 percentage point less than our June
forecast. Industrial production weakened in May following April’s strong print,
manufacturing PMIs fell across the region in June, and Singapore’s real GDP
unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter. On the positive side, exports in the
region holding steady in the second quarter following contractions in the previous two
quarters, and high-tech indicators suggest a recovery, albeit a sluggish one, for the
industry. Recovery in manufacturing, together with support from fiscal policy in
some countries, should boost growth to 3.5 percent by the end of the year, about its
Page 38 of 120

--- Page 42 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 19, 2019
potential pace, and it should remain at about that level over the remainder of the
forecast period.
• Mexico. Recent data have been mixed but, on balance, suggest that GDP expanded
modestly in the second quarter after contracting in the first. Manufacturing
production growth increased, boosted by strong exports, and private consumption
rebounded. However, plunging construction activity and weakness in services have
weighed on growth. We now expect the economy to grow at a sluggish 0.5 percent
pace in the second quarter, about 1 percentage point below our June Tealbook
forecast. Growth should then pick up gradually to a still-unimpressive 2.5 percent by
k
the end of 2020, supported by stronger U.S. manufacturing production and some o
o
l
monetary policy easing by the Bank of Mexico (BOM). However, the recent t
u
O
resignation of the finance minister, who decried the administration’s erratic economic &
l
policies, has increased policy uncertainty, and a potential loss of investor confidence e
v
e
poses a material downside risk to our forecast. D
n
o
c
E
Twelve-month inflation fell to 3.9 percent in June, pulled down by energy prices.
l
’
t
Citing still-ongoing pressures from wage growth and core inflation, the BOM left its n
I
policy rate unchanged at 8.25 percent in June. However, it changed its assessment of
inflation risks to neutral from tilted to the upside, with one member of the monetary
policy committee voting for a rate cut. We continue to expect the BOM to begin
cutting its policy rate in the fourth quarter of this year.
• Brazil. Incoming data provide little basis for optimism about the Brazilian economy.
The unemployment rate remained in double digits, retail sales were weak, and
industrial production stayed depressed, partially reflecting a dam disaster earlier this
year. We estimate that GDP growth in the second quarter was barely positive,
avoiding a technical recession. On the bright side, the pension reform cleared a major
hurdle when it was approved by the lower house of Congress. Assuming the passage
of the reform this year, diminished uncertainty and increases in business confidence
should boost growth gradually to 2.5 percent by next year. We now expect that
authorities will loosen monetary policy in the fourth quarter amid inflation close to its
target of 4 percent and lackluster domestic demand.
• Turkey. The independence of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT)
was dealt another blow after President Erdogan ousted Governor Murat Cetinkaya.
He was replaced by Murat Uysal, formerly one of the CBRT’s deputy governors.

President Erdogan, an ardent critic of high interest rates, reportedly warned Cetinkaya
multiple times to cut policy rates—which were raised last August in response to
financial volatility and rising inflation—and fired him when he did not oblige. The
firing dashed hopes of a return to a more orthodox approach to macroeconomic
policymaking after Erdogan’s party fared worse than expected in recent local
elections. Turkish asset prices fell in the aftermath of the firing of Cetinkaya—with
the lira depreciating and bond yields and credit spreads rising—although the market
reaction was relatively muted.

Financial Market Developments
Over the intermeeting period, financial market developments reflected noticeable
shifts in expectations for monetary policy in response to Federal Reserve communications
and economic data releases, and the expected path of policy moved down slightly, on net,
over the period. Currently, both market- and survey-based evidence suggest that market
participants see a 25 basis point reduction in the target range as the most likely outcome
at the July meeting, but that they also place some weight on a 50 basis point reduction.
Federal Reserve communications were generally regarded as more accommodative than
had been anticipated, exerting downward pressure on measures of the expected path for
the federal funds rate. However, some better-than-expected economic data releases and a
slight improvement in the outlook regarding trade partially offset these declines. Yields
on nominal Treasury securities also edged down on net. Equity prices increased over the
period, with notable gains on Federal Reserve communications and announcements
related to trade negotiations. Corporate bond spreads narrowed. The more-
accommodative-than-expected Federal Reserve communications, increased oil prices, and
higher-than-expected inflation data contributed to a rebound in inflation compensation.
 Measures of the expected level of the federal funds rate at the end of this year
and beyond moved down a bit on net. A straight read of OIS quotes suggests
s
a cumulative decline of 80 basis points this year, while a model that adjusts t
e
k

the VIX—decreased somewhat. Investment-grade and high-yield corporate
bond spreads narrowed 13 basis points and 17 basis points, respectively.
 Global equity indexes increased slightly and the exchange value of the dollar
decreased modestly on balance.

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
Measures of expectations for near-term domestic monetary policy exhibited
notable shifts and reversals over the intermeeting period and ended the period down
slightly, on net, with market participants appearing to continue to attach the greatest
weight to a 25 basis point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the
July meeting. Investors also continue to place some weight on a 50 basis point reduction.
The June FOMC statement and press conference, as well as the Chair’s remarks during
his July Monetary Policy Report testimony, were interpreted as being more
accommodative than had been expected, exerting downward pressure on market-based
measures of policy expectations. However, expectations for monetary policy also reacted
noticeably to better-than-expected economic data releases, such as the June employment
report, and to a slight easing of near-term trade tensions at the G-20 meeting, which
exerted partially offsetting upward pressure.
Consistent with significant variation in near-term expectations for monetary
policy, market-based indicators of interest rate uncertainty remained somewhat elevated.
The option-implied volatility for six-month-ahead one-year swap rates hovered near the
top of its range since 2010.
Market-based expectations for the federal funds rate for the end of this year and
beyond moved down a bit on net. A straight read of OIS forward rates implies that the
s
t
federal funds rate will decline about 80 basis points in 2019 and about 30 basis points in e
k
r
a
2020. In contrast, a staff model that adjusts for term premiums indicates only a 49 basis M
l
point decline in the rate by year-end 2019 and is consistent with a flat path for the federal a
ci
n
funds rate in 2020. a
n
Fi
The nominal U.S. Treasury yield curve declined and steepened slightly, on net,
over the intermeeting period. Nominal Treasury yields at the 2- and 10-year maturities
fell 9 basis points and 4 basis points, respectively. Both the near-term forward spread
and the spread between 10-year and three-month Treasury yields are still in the bottom
decile of their respective distributions since 1971.1 On net, since the June FOMC
meeting, 5-year and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based inflation compensation moved up 16 basis
points and 12 basis points, respectively, and now stand at 1.65 percent and 1.83 percent.
1 Some research suggests that the near-term forward spread is a bit more informative in terms of
predicting a transition to recession in the subsequent four quarters, compared with some popular measures
such as the spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields.

More-accommodative-than-expected Federal Reserve communications, stronger-than-
expected inflation data releases, and rising oil prices—amid increased geopolitical
tensions with Iran—contributed to the upward pressure on inflation compensation.
Broad stock price indexes increased 2.7 percent, on net, over the intermeeting
period, with notable increases following the June FOMC communications, the Chair’s
July Monetary Policy Report testimony, and announcements regarding trade negotiations
following the G-20 meeting. Equity price increases were broad based across major
sectors, with technology, consumer staples, and consumer discretionary firms
outperforming broad indexes. Stock prices of firms with high exposure to China reacted
more positively than stock prices of firms with low exposure to the announcement that
China and the United States agreed at the G-20 meeting to hold off on imposing new
tariffs. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index (the VIX) decreased
somewhat, on net, and now stands near the 24th percentile of its historical range.
Yields on corporate bonds decreased a touch, approaching historic lows. Spreads
on investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity
Treasury yields narrowed 13 basis points and 17 basis points, respectively. Corporate
bond spreads are somewhat low by historical standards but remain above the very low
levels that prevailed in early 2018.

Expectations for further policy accommodation in the euro area firmed following
the nomination of Christine Lagarde as the next president of the European Central Bank
(ECB). This development, along with ongoing reaction to ECB President Draghi’s mid-
June speech suggesting that the ECB would respond to a deterioration in the inflation
outlook, pushed euro-area yields to record lows. Notably, the 10-year German bund yield
briefly fell below the ECB’s deposit facility rate of negative 40 basis points. However,
core euro-area yields retraced their earlier declines following stronger-than-expected
industrial production data for May released later in the period. Euro-area peripheral
spreads narrowed significantly, including a 57 basis point drop in Italian spreads as the

government passed some fiscal consolidation measures. Extremely low yields continue
to weigh on the profitability of European banks (see the box “Interest Rate Expectations
and Market Performance of European Banks”). In Canada, strong consumer price and
wage data releases pushed up long-term yields. These moves were partially offset by
Bank of Canada communications emphasizing downside risks to the outlook, leaving the
10-year Canadian yield 8 basis points higher, on net, over the intermeeting period.
Global equity indexes increased slightly over the intermeeting period, supported
by expectations for further monetary accommodation by major central banks and some
lessening of trade uncertainty. At the G-20 meeting, the United States and China agreed
to restart trade negotiations and to indefinitely postpone tariffs on the remaining
$300 billion of Chinese imports. The U.S. Administration also announced an easing of
restrictions on U.S. firms’ sales to Huawei, which boosted global technology stocks.
The broad dollar index declined about 1 percent since the June FOMC meeting, in
part as a result of narrowing yield differentials between the United States and AFEs.
Reduced trade uncertainty contributed to the dollar depreciation against EME currencies.
Expected policy accommodation by advanced-economy central banks supported EME
asset prices, and EME bond flows were positive in recent weeks. Turkish assets came
under pressure following the unexpected replacement of the head of the Turkish central
bank; there was no evidence of spillovers into other markets.

Interest Rate Expectations and
Market Performance of European Banks
Disappointing data and dovish communications from the European Central Bank
(ECB) over the past several months, stressing a weaker growth outlook, have
contributed to a further decline in the expected path of ECB policy rates and
raised concerns about the earnings outlook for European banks. Since mid-April,
the broad index of European corporate share prices is little changed, but
European bank share prices have declined notably. Over the same period,
market participants have not priced in additional default risk for financial firms
compared to corporates. This fact suggests market participants assess that
lower-for-longer interest rates will not have significant effects on the safety and
soundness of large European banks and, by implication, on financial stability.
A weaker European economy would likely depress profits at both European
corporates and banks; however, banks would bear the brunt of lower-for-longer
interest rate policies, which have been shown to compress banks’ net interest
margins.1 Indeed, we see a notable divergence of stock performance of
European corporates and banks. As shown in figure 1, coinciding with the steep
decline in expected ECB policy rates implied by overnight index swaps (the red
line), the European bank stock index (the black line) has underperformed the
broad European stock index (the blue line).

The underperformance of European banks relative to the broader market is not
new. For example, the right panel of figure 1 shows that the divergence in
corporate and bank stock prices largely coincides with the overall downward
trend in ECB policy expectations since late 2018. The declines in the bank index
are broad based and influenced only slightly by the roughly 50 percent decline
since January 1, 2018, in Deutsche Bank’s stock price. Deutsche Bank’s stock price
has been adversely affected by chronically low profitability, legacy problems,
market pessimism about its newest, drastic restructuring plan, and the recent
step-down in interest rate expectations.
The market does not appear to be inferring any implications of the changes in the
euro-area economic outlook and ECB policy rates for financial stability because,
on net, the cost of protection against default risk of European financials has
fallen and has not changed relative to that of European corporates, as illustrated
in figure 2. Credit default swap (CDS) indexes of senior debt of European
financials (the black line) and European investment-grade corporates (the blue
line) have both declined in recent weeks to their lowest levels since early 2018.2
Average CDS premiums of European financials’ subordinated debt (not shown),
which is more sensitive to default risk than senior debt, are also little changed.
These trends imply that the factors driving corporate default risk—mainly the
economic outlook—are also driving the default risk of European financials, and
that expectations of lower-for-longer rates do not appear to be have added to
default risk of European banks.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for businesses and households were little changed over the
intermeeting period and remained generally supportive of spending. Net debt financing
for businesses slowed somewhat from May’s brisk pace but nonetheless posted solid
gains in June. Credit standards for loans to households generally remained favorable for
all but the riskiest borrowers.
• Corporate bond issuance moderated in June from the rapid pace in May,
though speculative-grade bond issuance increased strongly and yields neared
historical lows. Institutional leveraged loan issuance picked up in May before
returning to a moderate pace in June.
• Banks in the July 2019 SLOOS reported that standards for commercial and
industrial (C&I) loans to large and middle-market firms eased, on net, in the
second quarter. Even so, C&I loan growth was fairly modest over the quarter
as a whole.
• Mortgage rates remained near their lowest level in two years, and credit
standards continued to be generally accommodative.
• Consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace, with borrowing
rates either flat or easing.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Businesses
Financing conditions for businesses remained accommodative, with net debt
financing expanding in June at a pace in line with the average for recent years. Total
gross corporate bond issuance, while down from its outsized pace in May, remained
robust in June, with speculative-grade issuance increasing strongly and yields on
corporate bonds slipping further to near historical lows. Gross institutional leveraged
loan issuance increased notably in May but subsequently returned to the more moderate

with the sustained trend of easing, banks reported that the current level of standards for
C&I loans was on the easier end of the range of standards that have prevailed since 2005.
Apparently, easy supply conditions were offset by slackening demand, as C&I loan
growth was weak overall in the second quarter despite a modest pickup in June.
Public equity issuance has been strong in recent months. Very high levels of
equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings in May were followed up with
solid numbers in June. Overall, the market volatility in May left no discernible imprint
on corporate fundraising.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of
stabilization in June, following some deterioration earlier in the year. Although the six-
month trailing nonfinancial bond default rate edged up in May, June saw few credit
ratings changes while the KMV expected year-ahead default rate ticked down during the
intermeeting period to its lowest level since last September. Meanwhile, expectations of
year-ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms have been revised down only a touch in
recent months after sharp downward revisions around the turn of the year.
Small Businesses
Available data suggest that the supply of credit to small businesses remained
accommodative, while demand continued to be somewhat weak. Small business loan
originations, as measured by the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending
Index, continued to rise in May. In addition, in the June National Federation of
Independent Business (NFIB) survey, the net percent of respondents reporting that it was
harder to obtain credit now than three months ago was near post-crisis lows. At the same
time, the demand for credit by small businesses appears to have remained muted. Over
half of small business owners in the June NFIB poll continued to report that they were
not interested in a loan, and a significant net share of SLOOS respondents reported
weaker demand for C&I loans from small firms in the second quarter.

and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance was strong in the
second quarter, as yield spreads ticked down.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions for state and local governments in municipal bond markets
remained accommodative on balance. Gross issuance of municipal bonds was robust in
May and June, with new capital raising accounting for the majority of the issuance.
Municipal bond yields, and spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury securities,
decreased a touch in both secondary and primary markets.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative
over the intermeeting period. Mortgage rates rose 18 basis points since the June FOMC
meeting but remained about 1 full percentage point below their late-2018 level.
Underwriting standards—as measured by both SLOOS responses and maximum
allowable debt-to-income ratios—were little changed over the second quarter, although
they remain tight for borrowers with low credit scores. These conditions have supported
a modest increase in origination volume in recent months, with home-purchase
originations having returned to around the solid levels seen in 2017.
Refinance originations have risen as well but remain near historical lows.
Although many borrowers look like they could benefit from refinancing at the current
rate, refinancing activity is likely to remain muted. Staff calculations indicate that most
of the borrowers who could benefit from refinancing previously refrained from doing so
during periods with similarly low rates. These borrowers may be unaware of the
potential savings or may be unable or unwilling to refinance for other reasons.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent
s
n
o
months and remained generally supportive of consumer spending. Growth in consumer
ti
di
credit in April and May was up a bit from earlier in the year due to a pickup in credit card n
o
balances. Meanwhile, interest rates on credit card accounts were little changed in the C
g
n
second quarter, while rates on auto loans continued to slip lower, on net, from highs ci

Banks in the July SLOOS continued to report tightened standards for credit cards
over the second quarter, tightening that was likely concentrated on individuals with low
credit scores. Indeed, SLOOS respondents also indicated that the level of standards for
subprime credit cards continued to be on the tighter end of their post-2005 range, while
standards for prime credit cards remained around the midpoint of their range.
Nonetheless, another indicator of credit card supply—the mail volume of credit card
offers—rose notably for nonprime borrowers in the second quarter.
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS INDEXES
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial
corporations indicates that financing conditions have eased slightly over the intermeeting
period and remain accommodative relative to historical standards. The modest easing in
the index is consistent with the recent increase in equity prices and narrowing of
corporate spreads over the same period. As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook
section, other publicly available financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set
of financial variables into a summary series, also pointed to either roughly unchanged or
slightly more accommodative financial conditions. Overall, these indexes indicate that
broad financial conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to
historical standards.

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations, measures financing
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1 This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade. To the extent
that speculative-grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment-grade
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.
The second index in the table measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending
Practices. Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on
their balance sheets.2
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary
series using various statistical methods. While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial
market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both changes in financing conditions
and other shocks to the economy.
1 This index was first discussed in the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” in the Financing Conditions for
Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.
2 This index is an updated version of the index developed in William F. Bassett, Mary Beth Chosak,
John C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,”
Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 62 (March), pp. 23–40. The current index uses a new weighting approach for
each loan category.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS U
&
s
k
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic activity as being s
Ri
broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a
period that includes the most recent two recessions along with a number of other episodes with
elevated uncertainty and market volatility. Moreover, in line with our assessment in the June
Tealbook, we still judge the risks around our baseline projection for real GDP growth to be tilted
to the downside over the next year as well as further out, with a corresponding skew to the
upside for the unemployment rate. Important factors in our assessment are that trade policies,
foreign economic developments, and federal policies for budget appropriations and the debt
limit—along with financial market reactions—are more likely to move in directions that would
have significant negative effects on U.S. economic activity than to resolve more favorably than
assumed. Also, the softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this
year could be pointing to a more substantial slowing in economic growth than in the baseline. Of
course, there are risks to the upside as well. Many of the underlying fundamentals for household
spending and business investment remain solid—bolstered, in part, by the 2017 tax cuts—with a
strong labor market, favorable financial conditions, and upbeat readings on consumer (but not
business) sentiment. In these circumstances, consumer spending could expand at a pace that is
faster than in the staff projection, which, in turn, could help boost business investment.
As shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit,
the estimated probability of moving into recession over the next year based on a term spread
model remains elevated at 65 percent.1 The recession probability estimate from a model-
averaging framework that uses a selection of real and financial variables is 36 percent, which is
above the unconditional recession probability of 23 percent but lower than in the previous
Tealbook.2 Also, as indicated in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the
estimated probability of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) over the next three years is
currently 16 percent and rises to above 30 percent by the end of the medium term. Given the
1 This estimate should be interpreted with some caution given the long sample period over which the model
is estimated and secular trends—particularly declining term premiums—that may materially affect its predictions.
2 Since the previous Tealbook, the decline in corporate bond spreads and the VIX, along with the strong
recent gains for real PCE and payroll employment, contributed significantly to the downward revision in this
recession probability estimate. (The set of financial variables used in this estimation framework includes the
term spread.)

risks, the four-quarter-ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the
unemployment rate, presented in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year
Ahead,” are not unusually wide or skewed.
With regard to inflation, we continue to see average uncertainty around the projection,
but with the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the
inflation projection would also tend to have at least some downward skew. Moreover, even
though the latest monthly data on consumer prices have been firmer than the readings from early
this year, inflation so far has still been below our expectations from the beginning of this year.
In addition, underlying trend inflation, and thus longer-run inflation expectations, could currently
be lower than assumed in the baseline. Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate
more than expected and put downward pressure on inflation. Of course, there are also risks to
the upside. For example, an extended period with unusually tight resource utilization could
eventually lead to greater upward pressure on wages and prices, consistent with the predictions
of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation. In addition, an
unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to temporarily
higher inflation.
All of these inflation risks would tend to be of relatively modest size as long as inflation
expectations remained reasonably well anchored. However, the risks could increase
substantially, in either direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down. Such
3 The results shown in the exhibit are consistent with recent research, using quantile regressions, on the
distribution of fluctuations in the unemployment rate and in real GDP growth. For the unemployment rate, see
Michael Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018-067 (Washington:
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067. For real
GDP growth, see Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Nellie Liang, and Sheheryar Malik (2018), “The Term
Structure of Growth-at-Risk,” Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Working Paper 42 (Washington:
Brookings Institute, August), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WP42-NL-updated.pdf. The
results of their research suggest that the upside risk to the unemployment rate and the downside risk to GDP growth
are more pronounced in the medium term—specifically, two to three years ahead—when the unemployment rate is
low or credit growth is high.

Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s latest n
U
quantitative surveillance assessment, where the staff continues to judge overall financial &
s
k
vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to be at a moderate level. On the one hand, asset s
Ri
valuation pressures have increased somewhat since our previous assessment, as equity and
corporate bond prices recovered much of their losses at the end of 2018 and have reached the top
end of the “notable” range. Additionally, borrowing by nonfinancial businesses, as a ratio to
nominal GDP, has reached new highs recently. On the other hand, growth in household-sector
borrowing remains well below trend GDP growth, and underwriting standards in this sector are
generally strong. In addition, the largest U.S. banks continue to have strong capital positions,
and funding risks in the financial system are low. Reflecting this assessment, current financial
vulnerabilities do not appear likely to intensify shocks to an unusual degree through strains
within the financial sector, although a deterioration in the balance sheet of the nonfinancial
corporate sector could amplify shocks from both domestic and foreign developments.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline
projection using simulations of staff models. We simulate each of these scenarios using one of
three models maintained by the staff, which embed different macroeconomic structures and
dynamics.4 In the first three scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the baseline policy
rule, which assumes a coefficient of 0.2 on the output gap. In contrast, the last two scenarios
(“Global Investment Slump” and “Escalation of Trade Tensions”) assume a parameter value of
1.0 on the output gap in the policy rule, as we judge it is unlikely that monetary policy would
react in the manner embodied in the baseline rule when output growth slows notably. The fourth
scenario (“Recession with Financial Amplification”) allows for an even more aggressive
monetary policy response that is consistent with the historical reaction of the FOMC to a
recession. Finally, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the
baseline paths in all of the scenarios.
4 The three models used are (1) FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; (2) SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicounty DSGE model; and (3) GEMUS, which is a calibrated two-
country DSGE model.

ai
t
Total and core PCE price inflation have, on average, run below the Committee’s e r
c
n
2 percent objective for most of the past decade. In addition, some measures of longer-run U
&
inflation expectations have drifted down in the past several years. In the baseline projection,
s
k
longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting are assumed to generate an Ri s
underlying inflation trend that remains at 1.8 percent through the medium term. However, there
is a risk that actual inflation expectations are anchored at a level somewhat below what is
assumed in the baseline. In this scenario, we consider the possibility that the private sector’s
longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with underlying trend inflation that has been at
1.5 percent for a year now and that it will remain at that level for an extended period of time.
Policymakers are assumed to currently recognize this lower underlying inflation trend.
Lower inflation expectations lead to actual inflation running below the baseline and
hovering around 1.7 percent over the projection period. Lower realized inflation implies that the
federal funds rate stays below the baseline throughout the projection period and is about 35 basis
points lower by 2024. Real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are little affected, as the
nominal federal funds rate evolves in tandem with inflation, leaving real interest rates essentially
unchanged.
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US]
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment
remain solid, including quite upbeat readings on consumer sentiment, strong labor market
conditions, and low interest rates. Indeed, PCE is estimated to have increased at a robust pace in
the second quarter. In this scenario, we assume that consumer spending and, in turn, investment
expand at a pace faster than in the baseline. We also assume that these favorable conditions
result in a larger cyclical response in labor force participation than has typically been the case.
Under these assumptions, GDP increases 3.1 percent, on average, in 2019 and 2020,
which is a pace comparable with that in 2018. With a greater-than-typical cyclical response in
labor force participation, the unemployment rate declines to 3 percent at the beginning of 2021, a
smaller decline than what the model’s Okun’s law relationship would suggest. Inflation
increases slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2024. In response to the stronger economy, and with
inflation little changed, the federal funds rate rises relative to the baseline, reaching 3¼ percent
in 2024.

The unemployment rate is currently 0.9 percentage point below the staff’s 4.6 percent e r
c
n
estimate for its natural rate. Nevertheless, wage gains have remained modest in recent years U
&
largely because, in the staff’s assessment, trend productivity growth has been slow. However,
s
k
another way of reconciling modest wage growth with a very low unemployment rate is that Ri s
resource utilization may be less tight than assumed in the baseline. In this scenario, the level of
potential output in recent years is assumed to have been higher than judged in the baseline, such
that the output gap was close to zero in the middle of last year. Moreover, this scenario assumes
that potential output growth in future years is faster than in the baseline. Specifically, we assume
that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past several years than in the
baseline and continues to fall to 3.75 percent at the end of 2019, more than ¾ percentage point
lower than in the baseline.5 We also assume that the trend labor force participation rate has been
decreasing at a slower pace than in the baseline for the past several years and continues to do so
going forward. In addition, structural productivity is assumed to grow ¼ percentage point faster
than in the baseline in the past several years and going forward.
Because we assume that households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential
growth and its implications for income and profits, consumer spending and investment are
stronger. GDP growth is, on average, about 1 percentage point per year above the baseline. The
unemployment rate falls to about 3 percent by the end of 2024, around ¾ percentage point lower
than in the staff projection. Even so, given the lower natural rate in this scenario, resource
utilization is less tight than in the baseline over the next several years. The path for inflation is
slightly below the baseline, on average, primarily reflecting the stronger productivity growth in
this scenario. Because policymakers are assumed to recognize these more favorable supply-side
conditions, the path of the federal funds rate is about 35 basis points lower, on average, than in
the baseline.
Recession with Financial Amplification [FRB/US]

the continued flatness in the yield curve could be pointing to a substantial deterioration in
economic activity. As noted earlier, a statistical model based on the term spread in Treasury

y yields indicates that the probability of a recession over the next year is elevated. Moreover,
t
n
ai leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is elevated. In this scenario, a recession is assumed
t
r
e to be amplified by highly indebted businesses that reduce their hiring and investment by more
c
n
U than they would if their debt was lower.6 We also assume that monetary policymakers
&
aggressively respond to the sharp and sustained increase in the unemployment rate, consistent
s
k
s
Ri with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.
Real GDP starts to decline later this year and the unemployment rate starts to rise sharply.
The federal funds rate declines significantly but becomes constrained by the ELB in the third
quarter of 2020, thereby prolonging the downturn. GDP only begins to recover in 2021, and the
unemployment rate peaks at 7.1 percent in 2022, an increase of more than 3½ percentage points
from the start of the recession. With substantial slack in resource utilization, inflation falls to
1.5 percent in 2021.
Global Investment Slump [SIGMA]
The growth of goods trade, manufacturing, and investment has slowed significantly in
many areas of the global economy since 2017. By our assessment, recent tariff increases and
heightened uncertainty about trade policy likely played a significant role in this slowdown, as
have other factors such as the downturn in the global tech cycle—a synchronized pattern of
production and trade in electronics across economies—and country-specific developments that
lowered global demand. As these other factors fade, in our baseline we expect trade,
manufacturing, and investment to stabilize. However, recent surveys of business attitudes and
intentions—not only in the United States, but globally—continue to flag concerns about trade
policy, and measures of trade policy uncertainty are at historically high levels.7 Trade policy
uncertainty may have played a larger role in the recent manufacturing slowdown than we have
assessed, and its adverse effects on the global outlook may have yet to play out fully.
In this scenario, we assume that global investment remains more sensitive to the
unprecedented level of trade policy uncertainty than we envision in the baseline, which sets in
6 Specifically, we assume shocks that are somewhat more severe than those consistent with the recession in
the early 1990s.
7 See, for instance, the trade policy uncertainty index presented in Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick
Molligo, Andrea Prestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2019), “The Economic Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty,” paper
presented at the 91st meeting of the Carnegie-Rochester-NYU Conference in Public Policy, held at New York
University, New York, April 12–13.

motion a global investment slump. As firms in the United States and abroad wait for these

the dollar. All told, the level of foreign GDP is 1.5 percent below the baseline through 2021. Ri
Weaker aggregate demand in the United States and abroad and the stronger dollar cause a
substantial slowdown in U.S. economic activity. In particular, real GDP growth falls to
0.2 percent in the second half of 2019, 1.5 percentage points below the baseline, and the
unemployment rate rises above 4.0 percent in 2020. Core PCE inflation remains below 2 percent
until 2024. Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline,
falling to 1.7 percent in 2021.
Escalation of Trade Tensions [GEMUS]
Our current baseline assumes a ceasefire in ongoing trade disputes, meaning that the
United States and its trading partners impose no new tariffs, but existing tariffs, including those
raised on May 10 on a sizable tranche of Chinese imports, remain in place. While the current
process of trade negotiations could ultimately lead to lower trade barriers, we cannot exclude the
possibility that trade tensions escalate further, resulting in a sizable increase in trade barriers that
would entail profoundly adverse effects.
This scenario assumes that, in the second half of 2019, additional tariffs are imposed on
imports not previously tariffed from China and on vehicle imports from most countries. In
addition, tariffs are imposed on all Mexican imports, notwithstanding the June 7 agreement that
reduced the threat of such an action. In particular, we assume that, throughout the second half of
2019, tariffs of 25 percent are imposed on $275 billion of imports from China, tariffs of
20 percent are imposed on $160 billion of vehicle imports, and tariffs of 25 percent are imposed
on $314 billion of imports from Mexico. In our scenario, Mexico and China partially retaliate
against the U.S. actions, while tariffs on vehicles trigger a fully proportionate response. Because
higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies
have little effect on the trade balance. However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods

These developments lead to a significant and protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy.
Real GDP growth drops to only 0.3 percent in the second half of 2019 and rises to only
1.2 percent in 2020, almost 1 percentage point below the baseline. Higher import prices boost
total PCE inflation to 3.5 percent in the second half of this year before inflation falls below the
baseline as the effect of the new tariffs dies out and as the economy slows down. Despite the
initial jump in inflation, policymakers decide to “look through” the temporary increase in prices.
Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, declining to
1.9 percent by the end of 2020, 0.7 percentage point below the baseline.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, the FRB/US model projects real
GDP growth to slow from 3 percent in 2018 to 2.1 percent in 2019 and to about 1½ percent in
the next two years—a modestly weaker path than in the Tealbook baseline.9 The model’s
forecast of real GDP growth has revised up about 35 basis points in 2019 compared with the
previous Tealbook, primarily reflecting better-than-expected consumption growth from the
model’s perspective. In terms of the contour of the model’s forecast, the projected deceleration
in real GDP mainly reflects the projection that both consumption and business investment
growth will move down from what the model perceives as unusually strong readings in recent
years. In the case of consumption, the model could not explain those earlier positive surprises
based on fundamentals (wealth and income) and hence does not carry that strength forward in the
projection; instead, it has consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend. The model’s
assessment that asset prices (equity and property wealth) are currently above normal valuations
and thus will fall or decelerate over the next year also contributes to the weakening in
consumption growth through the wealth channel. With slowing overall output, business
investment also decelerates. Given that relatively weak outlook, the model forecasts the output
9 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projections for variables from the U.S. government
sector, foreign real GDP growth, foreign inflation, and the paths of the U.S. dollar and oil prices. The federal funds
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline. The model forecast starts in the
third quarter of this year, taking as given key macroeconomic variables from the judgmental forecast for the
second quarter.

gradually converges to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective by the end of 2020. For a number of
years, wages have been below the level consistent with the model’s wage Phillips curve, holding
down marginal costs and depressing inflation over that period, and the model expects these wage
shocks to fade gradually.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals s
Ri
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
t
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. Compared with the June Tealbook, the inflation
projection is a bit higher in the next few quarters and little changed thereafter, whereas
the output gap is seen as modestly more positive over the medium term and beyond.
Consequently, the policy rate paths prescribed by the strategies are generally slightly
higher than in the June Tealbook. In a special exhibit, we examine optimal control
simulations when the underlying baseline projection is consistent with the median
responses to the June 2019 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) rather than the
staff forecast.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four simple policy rules: the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule,
the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and a flexible price-level targeting (FPLT)
rule.1 These near-term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for
the output gap and core inflation, which are shown in the middle panels.2 The top and
middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate.
• Reflecting slightly higher inflation and the somewhat wider output gap, the
near-term prescriptions of the policy rules are slightly higher than those in the
June Tealbook.
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes higher policy rates than the
Tealbook baseline because it responds more strongly to the positive output
gap than the conditional attenuated rule underlying the Tealbook baseline
projection.
1 The appendix in this Tealbook section provides technical details on these simple policy rules.
Except for the first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of
the projection of the output gap.

current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the June 2019 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r*.

• The Taylor (1993) rule, which does not feature an interest rate smoothing
term, calls for higher policy rates than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule.
• The first-difference rule, which responds to the change in the expected output
gap, prescribes a policy rate path that is slightly higher than the Tealbook
baseline path.
• The FPLT rule calls for cutting the federal funds rate to about 2 percent by the
fourth quarter of 2019 in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the
core PCE price index of 2½ percent since the end of 2011.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*) generated under two baselines: the
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2019 SEP.3
In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used. This concept of r*, labeled
“FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained
over a 12-quarter period starting in the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero
in the final quarter of that period. This concept of r* is a summary of the projected
underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into account considerations
such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal
funds rate.
• At 1.97 percent, the current value of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is
about 25 basis points higher than its estimate for the same quarter in the June
Tealbook because of the wider output gap projected by the staff in the
medium term.
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2021 (the
final year reported in the June 2019 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth and
monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

• At 0.65 percent, the June 2019 SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is somewhat lower
than the current-quarter estimate based on the March 2019 SEP projection, at
0.89 percent (not shown). The downward revision mainly stems from a
decline in the median projected path for the federal funds rate over the
medium term without much change in the output gap projection.
• The Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is higher than the SEP-consistent
FRB/US r* because the Tealbook projection features a wider output gap over
the medium term despite its somewhat higher path for the real federal
funds rate.

the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the
implications for interest rates and the economy.
• Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook
baseline, the federal funds rate is flat at 2.4 percent this year and edges up to
2.7 percent by the end of 2021. The prescribed path for the policy rate is
revised up only a bit compared with the June Tealbook because the baseline
rule responds modestly and gradually to the wider output gap.
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output
gap, calls for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace and to slightly
exceed 3½ percent by 2021. Thereafter, the path remains above the Tealbook
baseline path for several years. The less accommodative monetary conditions
produce an unemployment rate that, in contrast to the Tealbook baseline, rises
steadily toward the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.

Inflation is lower and the real 10-year Treasury yield is higher than the
corresponding values in the Tealbook baseline.
• The Taylor (1993) rule calls for increases in the federal funds rate in the near
term, to 3½ percent by early 2020, after which the rule calls for slight
declines. The federal funds rate path prescribed by this rule is at first above
the corresponding paths under both the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule. Later, however, it is below the path under the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule and above the path in the Tealbook baseline. The
relatively high initial values arise because the Taylor (1993) rule has no
inertial component and thus calls for an immediate upward adjustment in the
path of the policy rate in response to the high level of the current output gap.
• The first-difference rule, which reacts to the expected change in the output
gap rather than its level, prescribes small, gradual increases in the federal
funds rate through the end of 2020, followed by a sequence of slight
reductions during the period in which the output gap is projected to narrow.
The federal funds rate path edges down to 2¾ percent by 2024, in line with
the prescriptions of the conditional attenuated rule that year. The resulting
path for the real 10-year Treasury yield is similar to the baseline projection in
the near term and lower than that projection in the medium term. As a result,
this strategy generates higher inflation and eventually a lower unemployment
rate than the staff projection.
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate, the cumulative shortfall of
the level of core PCE prices from a target path defined by the growth of that
price level at an annual rate of 2 percent from the end of 2011 onward.
Eliminating the current 2½ percent shortfall requires inflation to run above
2 percent in coming years. Because the simulation embeds the assumptions
that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the
real 10-year Treasury rate immediately drops to negative 0.4 percent and
remains below the corresponding Tealbook baseline path throughout the
period shown. The unemployment rate is substantially lower under the FPLT
rule than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping to near

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

3 percent in 2021. Inflation exceeds 2 percent by about 20 basis points, on
average, over the next decade.
• Over the projection period shown, the simple rules’ policy rate prescriptions
are as much as 40 basis points higher than the corresponding prescriptions in
the June Tealbook because of higher projected resource utilization.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations conditional on the Tealbook
baseline under two different assumptions about policymakers’ preferences, as captured
by alternative specifications of the loss function.4 The concept of optimal control
employed here is one in which policymakers are able to commit future policymakers to
their plans; such a commitment, where feasible, may lead to improved economic
outcomes.5
• The simulation labeled “Equal weights” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the federal funds rate runs significantly higher than
the Tealbook baseline path and reaches a peak of 5 percent in late 2021.6 This
strategy is designed to counter the projected sizable and persistent
undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate that occurs in the
Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with the equal-weights loss
function judge to be undesirable. The smaller unemployment gap implies
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that may not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.
6 Because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and credible, changes in the
federal funds rate are not disruptive, regardless of the magnitude of their departure from historical norms.
In practice, however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate abruptly, wage and price setters
and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate tighter
monetary policy than policymakers envision, in which case macroeconomic outcomes may be less
favorable than would otherwise be the case.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

only a modestly lower path of inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the
response of inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.
• The simulation labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but is otherwise
identical to the specification with equal weights. Under this strategy, the path
for the federal funds rate is considerably below the path under equal weights
because policymakers’ desire to keep inflation close to 2 percent is not
tempered by an aversion to the unemployment rate falling below its natural
rate. Moreover, the policy rate path and outcomes under this strategy are
similar to those under the Tealbook baseline because, with inflation running
near 2 percent over the next several years and with policymakers attaching no
loss to unemployment undershooting its natural rate, the current policy rate
path already delivers outcomes that are close to optimal, based on this
loss function.
• The federal funds rate projections from the equal-weights and asymmetric
specifications conditional on the current Tealbook projection are as much as
45 basis points and 30 basis points higher, respectively, than their
corresponding prescriptions based on the June Tealbook projection. The
revisions to the asymmetric specification are somewhat smaller than those for
the equal-weights specification because policy in the former specification is
only affected by revisions to the unemployment gap when the unemployment
rate is above the estimate of its natural rate.
OPTIMAL CONTROL USING A PROJECTION CONSISTENT WITH THE SEP
The next exhibit illustrates the sensitivity of optimal control policy rate
prescriptions and outcomes to changes in assumptions about structural features of the
economy, such as the natural rate of unemployment. The exhibit compares simulations
conditional on the Tealbook baseline (discussed earlier and reproduced in the left
column) to those conditional on the SEP-consistent projection (shown in the
right column).
• Overall, the path of the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate, and the
inflation rate in the Tealbook baseline are similar to those in the SEP-

consistent baseline. However, the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, at 4.6 percent, is higher than the median estimate of the
longer-run unemployment rate in the June 2019 SEP, which stands at
4.2 percent. Accordingly, the Tealbook projection features greater labor
market tightness than is implicit in the SEP-consistent projection.7
• Under the equal-weights specification, the path of the federal funds rate peaks
at 3.4 percent in 2021 when we condition on the SEP-consistent baseline,
about 1½ percentage points less than prescribed under this loss function when
we condition on the Tealbook baseline. This lower path for the policy rate
arises because, under the SEP-consistent baseline, the unemployment gap that
policymakers aim to close is smaller than in the Tealbook baseline.
• Under the asymmetric specification and conditioning on the SEP-consistent
baseline, the prescriptions for the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate,
and the inflation rate are near those in the SEP-consistent baseline. This
similarity arises because the asymmetric specification attaches no loss to
unemployment undershooting its natural rate and sees inflation near or at
2 percent over the next several years; thus, from the perspective of this loss
function, the baseline policy rate path is already near optimal. However, this
similarity does not imply that policymakers are acting according to an
asymmetric loss function. In particular, policymakers’ assessments of
appropriate policy may factor in elements that are not captured by our perfect-
foresight analysis, such as uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment
in a low-r* environment.8
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and optimal control
simulations under the Tealbook baseline shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control
Simulations under Commitment.”
7 In the construction of the SEP-consistent baseline, we assume that the natural rate of
unemployment over the projection period coincides with the median SEP estimate of the unemployment
rate in the longer run.
8 More generally, in constructing the SEP-consistent baseline as well as in performing the
simulations, the staff makes assumptions about the underlying economic relationships that need not
coincide with the perceived economic tradeoffs of SEP respondents.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
s
e
gi future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
e policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
t
a
r macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
t
S
commitment strategies.
y
c
li
o
P The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
y
r makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
a
e t variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
n
o uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
M
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.

The first rule in the table was studied by Taylor (1993). The inertial Taylor (1999) rule
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time compared with the
Taylor (1993) rule. The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap, like the
FPLT rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 The conditional
attenuated rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but responds less strongly to
the output gap. Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant
and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation obje𝐿𝐿c𝐿𝐿tive and an
𝑟𝑟
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent. The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
2 For applications, see, for example, Erceg and others (2012). An FPLT rule similar to the one
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).

To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
s
e
gi gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
e
t consistent economic projection. This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
a
r some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.3 The
t
S
y measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
c
li expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
o
P variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
y
r
a
t
e The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
n
o consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
M
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.
3 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the
difference between four-quarter headline PCE price inflation, , and the Committee’s
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( , meas𝑃𝑃u𝑃𝑃r𝑃𝑃ed as the difference between
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the
𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
federal funds rate. In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, :
𝛽𝛽 = 0.9963

𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the
specifications of the loss function. The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two
specifications.
Loss Functions
𝜆𝜆𝑢𝑢,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏
𝜆𝜆𝜋𝜋 𝜆𝜆𝐿𝐿
Equal weights 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏 < 0 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏 ≥ 0
Asymmetric weight 1 1 1 1
on ugap
1 0 1 1
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the
absolute) values of the weights.
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates. Policy tools other than the
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy
decisions made prior to the simulation period.
