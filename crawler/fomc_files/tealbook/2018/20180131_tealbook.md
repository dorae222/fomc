Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
Although labor market information has come in very close to what we had D
n
anticipated in the December Tealbook, spending and production appear to be on stronger o
c
E
near-term trajectories than we had expected. In addition, our outlook for the economy c
ti
s
over the medium term is markedly stronger, as the projected revenue reductions in the e
m
recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) are much larger over the next three years o
D
than we had assumed in the previous Tealbook.
We now estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the
second half of last year and forecast that it will rise at a 3 percent pace in the first half of
this year. Although the unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent in November and
December, average monthly job gains have been solid and faster than what we judge
would be consistent with unchanged labor utilization. We project the unemployment rate
to move down gradually to 3.8 percent by the middle of this year as the economy
continues to expand briskly, supported in part by the initial effects of the tax cuts.
Over the next few years, real GDP growth is projected to slow steadily from
nearly 3 percent this year to 2 percent in 2020 as monetary policy tightens further. The
tax changes are assumed to generate a small expansion in the productive capacity of the
economy, but GDP growth is projected to nonetheless outpace that of potential over the
next two years. As a result, the output gap widens to 3¼ percent by late 2019 and
remains at that level in 2020, ending the medium term about 1¼ percentage points larger
than in the December Tealbook forecast. The unemployment rate is projected to bottom
out at 3¼ percent in mid-2019 and remain at that level in 2020, about 1½ percentage
points below our estimate of its natural rate.
Inflation readings since the previous Tealbook have come in about as expected on
balance. Over the 12 months ending in December, we estimate that total PCE prices rose
1.7 percent and core PCE prices rose 1.5 percent, both the same as in the December
Tealbook forecast. We continue to think that last year’s soft core inflation readings
primarily reflect idiosyncratic factors that will not persist. As that transitory weakness
passes and as resource utilization tightens more substantially than in our previous
forecast, core PCE price inflation is projected to move a little above 2 percent by 2019,
and total PCE price inflation is forecast to reach 2 percent in 2020.

l Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts
e
v
e
D
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2017 is a touch above the projections
n
o
from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus
c
E
and somewhat above both of them in 2018. The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is
c
s
ti
similar to the SPF and Blue Chip forecasts in 2017 and about ½ percentage point below
e
m them in 2018. The staff’s projection for CPI inflation is above the Blue Chip and SPF
o
D forecasts in both 2017 and 2018. The staff’s projections for overall PCE price inflation
and for core PCE inflation are a little higher than the SPF forecasts in both 2017
and 2018.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
u
t
O
&
Fiscal Policy l
e
v
 We have updated our fiscal policy assumptions to incorporate the TCJA, D e
n
which was enacted after the December Tealbook projection was finalized. We o
c
E
assume that this legislation will reduce average annual tax revenue by
c
ti
approximately 1¼ percent of GDP from 2018 through 2020. In turn, those tax s
e
m
reductions are projected to raise the level of real GDP 1¼ percent by the end o
D
of 2020. (For further analysis, see the box “Macroeconomic Effects of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.”)
o We continue to assume that in five years, with an elevated and rising debt-
to-GDP ratio, fiscal policymakers will begin to enact deficit-reduction
measures that gradually bring annual deficits back to sustainable levels.
 We estimate that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government
boosted aggregate demand less than ¼ percentage point in 2017. Looking
ahead, we project that discretionary government policy actions will increase
GDP growth about ½ percentage point per year from 2018 through 2020—
exclusive of any multiplier effect and offsets from reactions in interest rates
and the dollar—approximately ¼ percentage point more per year than in the
December Tealbook, reflecting the larger-than-anticipated medium-term tax
reductions in the TCJA.
 The federal government faces two key fiscal-related deadlines requiring near-
term actions. The first is the need to enact appropriations to fund government
operations by midnight tonight (January 19), when the current continuing
resolution expires, to avoid a shutdown.1 The second deadline is the lifting of
the statutory federal debt limit, as we estimate that the Treasury Department
will exhaust available “extraordinary measures” and cash in early March.
(For further discussion of issues associated with the debt limit, see the box
“Projections for Federal Debt Subject to Limit” in the Financial Market
1 A lapse of appropriations that resulted in a short-term shutdown of the federal government would
likely have only minor implications for the outlook. For example, we estimate that the 16-day shutdown in
October 2013 reduced real GDP growth ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that year and boosted it
by an equal amount in the following quarter. That estimate embodies our judgment that there were no
material effects on private investment or consumption due to reduced confidence or increased uncertainty.

Macroeconomic Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
&
l
e
v The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law after the December Tealbook
e
D
projection closed. The act is expected to reduce federal tax collections by roughly
n
o 1¼ percent of GDP, on average, over the next three years.1 On the individual income
c
E
side of the tax code, the legislation cuts marginal tax rates and broadens the tax base
c
ti
by ending or reducing deductions such as those for state and local taxes. In addition, it
s
e
m reduces the effective tax rate on income from certain pass-through businesses. The
o
legislation also makes significant changes to the corporate income tax code: The top
D
marginal tax rate is cut from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the tax base is broadened.
Furthermore, full expensing of equipment and intangibles (E&I) investment is provided
for the next several years, and the deductibility of net interest payments is restricted
somewhat. Finally, the tax system is shifted from a worldwide tax base toward a
territorial system.
We estimate that the key provisions of the legislation will provide an immediate boost
to aggregate demand and will also lead to an increase in the productive capacity of the
economy over time. Line 2 of the table on the next page shows that the direct
aggregate demand effects of the legislation, which exclude general equilibrium
effects—that is, follow-on multiplier effects and financial offsets such as the rise in
interest rates implied by the intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule—are
expected to raise the level of real GDP about 1 percent by the end of 2020.
These direct aggregate demand effects operate through multiple channels that affect
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and business fixed investment (BFI). PCE is
expected to increase for two reasons. First, individual income tax cuts generate higher
disposable personal income for individuals and pass-through businesses. Second,
higher after-tax profits from the corporate tax cuts boost equity prices.2 The resulting
increase in household wealth raises consumption. BFI is expected to increase as a
result of reductions in business income taxes. In particular, cuts in marginal corporate
tax rates and, more importantly, full expensing of E&I investment reduce the user cost
of capital.3 Moreover, there is a further increase in investment demand due to greater
business cash flow. Overall, nearly three-fourths of the anticipated boost to aggregate
demand is due to an increase in PCE, with the remainder attributable to BFI.
The TCJA is expected to raise potential output by the end of 2020 via two channels.
First, lower marginal tax rates on labor income increase the supply of labor. Second,
1 Under the assumption that the tax legislation has no effect on GDP (that is, a static estimate),
the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that over a 10-year budget window, the TCJA will reduce
federal revenues by a bit more than ½ percent of GDP annually on average. But the tax cuts are much
greater during the first 5 years of the 10-year budget window. Thereafter, many of the provisions of
the TCJA phase out.
2 The staff assumes that this effect has already been incorporated into equity prices.
3 With full expensing, marginal tax rates have only a limited effect on the user cost of capital.
However, nonresidential structures are not eligible for full expensing under the TCJA; thus, the
marginal tax rate cuts will significantly reduce the user cost of capital for these investments.

u
the additional investment induced by the tax legislation results in capital deepening O
and, therefore, higher structural productivity and potential output. Over this period, &
l
we estimate that the level of potential output will increase by 0.35 percent because of e
v
the tax legislation (line 3), mostly as a result of increased labor supply. The boost to e
D
potential output further increases demand as households begin to realize higher labor n
o
income; for that reason, the potential output effects on GDP are additive to the direct c
E
aggregate demand effects in line 2. c
ti
s
e
m
After the initial increase in aggregate demand, follow-on multiplier effects will further
o
augment growth (line 4). However, some of the aggregate demand effects will be D
offset by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar as the widening of the output gap
leads to a tightening of monetary policy (line 5). We estimate that, on net, the TCJA will
boost the level of real GDP 1¼ percent by the end of 2020 (line 1). But, owing to the
increase in potential, the output gap is projected to widen a bit less than 1 percent
(line 8). Given the increase in the output gap, we also project that the unemployment
rate will be 0.5 percentage point lower at the end of 2020, while core PCE price inflation
will be about 0.1 percentage point higher.
These effects are significantly larger than the ones we built into the December Tealbook
(line 7). And they are slightly larger than the effects in the December 7, 2017, memo to
the FOMC, “Staff’s Revised Fiscal Policy Assumptions” (line 6), as the size of the
medium-term tax cuts in the TCJA turned out to be a little larger than we had assumed
in that memo.
Our estimates of the act’s effects draw on analyses by other government agencies as
well as a careful reading of the relevant academic literature. Nonetheless, many
judgment calls are required. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding
the effects of this complex legislation.

o Monetary Policy
c
E
c  The intercept-adjusted inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule calls for the
ti
s
e federal funds rate to rise 1.5 percentage points this year, with further increases
m
o averaging around 1.1 percentage points in each of the next two years, bringing
D
the rate up to 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The federal funds rate
is assumed to be 80 basis points higher at the end of the medium term than it
was in the December Tealbook, primarily reflecting the larger positive
output gap.
 The SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predictable decline as securities
are redeemed consistent with the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum to the
Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and with the process initiated in
October 2017.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly over the medium
term, from an average of 2.7 percent in the current quarter to 4.3 percent by
the end of 2020, 0.7 percentage point higher than in our December projection.
The upward revision to the path for the 10-year Treasury yield reflects the
new path for the federal funds rate and a small upward revision to the term
premium, the latter of which is a consequence of a larger projected stock of
federal debt.
 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond rate are also
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term. The paths for these two
rates were revised up mostly in line with revisions to the path of the 10-year
Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 The projected path of stock prices is about 5 percent higher than in the
December Tealbook, reflecting recent increases in broad equity price indexes.
As in previous projections, we assess that valuation pressures will limit the

scope for future stock price increases, and we expect equity prices to rise after t l
u
O
the current quarter around 0.4 percent per year, about the same pace as in the
&
l
December Tealbook. e
v
e
D
 Incoming data on house prices have been slightly above our expectations. We n
o
c
estimate that house prices increased at an average rate of 6 percent last year E
c
ti
and expect that the rate of increase will slow to about 4 percent over the next s
e
m
three years. Despite the brisk pace of house price increases, the ratio of house
o
D
prices to rents is forecast to remain only somewhat above its estimated long-
run trend.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
 We estimate that real GDP in foreign economies grew at an annual rate of
about 3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, rebounding from a
temporarily weak 2½ percent pace in the third quarter. We see economic
growth abroad continuing at around 3 percent in 2018 before edging down to
2¾ percent thereafter. This forecast is supported by buoyant financial
markets, still-accommodative monetary policies, and positive spillovers from
strong U.S. economic growth in the coming years. Relative to the December
Tealbook, our outlook for foreign economic growth is about ¼ percentage
point higher in 2018, with a slightly smaller revision over the remainder of the
forecast period.
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 2½ percent since the time of
the December Tealbook amid positive foreign economic data and a slight
firming of expectations for monetary policy normalization abroad. We expect
the broad real dollar to appreciate at about a 2 percent annual rate over the
medium term, a little faster than in the previous Tealbook, as market
expectations for the federal funds rate are assumed to move up toward the
upwardly revised staff forecast. The higher projected rate of appreciation
offsets only some of the recent realized depreciation, leaving the level of the
broad real dollar at the end of 2020 about 1¼ percent lower.
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices
 Since the December Tealbook forecast, the spot price of oil and prices for
many industrial metals reached their highest levels in three years, supported

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY o
D
We estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the fourth
quarter of last year, about 1¼ percentage points faster than in our previous projection.2
The upward revision reflects positive incoming data on consumer expenditures, business
spending, and residential investment, which more than offset data suggesting that net
exports were a sizable drag on GDP last quarter. We took only limited signal from the
fourth-quarter growth surprises going forward. As a result, first-half real GDP growth
has been revised up only slightly, to 3 percent.
 Our near-term outlook for consumer spending is noticeably stronger than in
the December Tealbook. We now estimate that real PCE rose 3¾ percent in
the fourth quarter, an upward revision of 1¼ percentage points. Much of the
revision reflects unusually strong retail sales in November and a solid increase
in December, along with a jump in December vehicle sales that appears
largely to have been fueled by incentives.3 Given solid fundamentals, we
expect consumer spending to increase 2¾ percent in the first half of this year,
boosted a bit by the initial effects of the personal tax cuts.
 Recent data suggest that business investment in equipment and intangibles
(E&I) rose nearly 11 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, continuing
a string of sizable increases throughout 2017. Some of the recent strength is
the result of a presumably transitory surge in purchases of transportation
equipment, as well as both continued payback from an unusually weak 2016
2 The BEA’s advance estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter is scheduled to be published on
January 26, the Friday before the FOMC meeting. We continue to estimate that the effects of the fall
hurricanes subtracted ½ percentage point from real GDP growth in the third quarter and boosted it
¾ percentage point in the fourth.
3 We had expected vehicle sales to decline in December, consistent with anecdotal reports that
suggested the impetus to sales from replacing hurricane-damaged vehicles was mostly completed in
November.

c
ti
s more than offset the recovery in drilling activity. We expect spending to turn
e
m
up in the coming quarters, driven primarily by a rebound of nondrilling
o
D
structures.
 Nearly all of the data on housing activity received since the December
Tealbook were considerably stronger than we expected. As a result, we now
estimate that residential investment jumped at an annual rate of 11¼ percent
in the fourth quarter of last year after declining in the previous two
quarters. We have taken on board the higher level of housing activity in the
forecast but expect just modest increases in the first half of this year as the
impetus from population growth, demographic changes, and the healthy labor
market is tempered by higher interest rates and the constrained supply of labor
and of developed lots available for new construction.4
 Net exports are currently estimated to have subtracted more than ½ percentage
point from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter—whereas we had expected
trade to be a neutral factor in the December Tealbook—as import growth has
rebounded following two very weak quarters. In the first half of 2018, net
exports are expected to shift toward being neutral for GDP growth, as recent
dollar depreciation supports exports and restrains imports.
 Manufacturing output jumped 7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
Nearly half of the increase reflects the recovery from the fall hurricanes and a
bounceback in motor vehicle assemblies after a third-quarter decline, but other
segments of manufacturing production also expanded at a fairly brisk pace.
Indicators of near-term manufacturing activity, such as the new orders indexes
in the various surveys of purchasing managers, are generally upbeat, and
automakers’ assembly schedules call for light vehicle production to rise
4 Relevant demographic changes include the aging of the population (which is notable in part
because of high homeownership rates among seniors) and a leveling out of the historically high share of
young adults living with their parents.

e
D
We project real GDP to rise nearly 3 percent in 2018 and to decelerate steadily to n

2 percent by 2020 as monetary policy tightens. The projected path of GDP growth is E

¼ to ½ percentage point higher per year than in the December Tealbook, primarily s
ti
e
m
reflecting the larger-than-anticipated tax cuts. The level of GDP at the end of 2020 in
o
D
this projection is more than 1½ percent above the previous projection, but this higher
level does not show through completely to the output gap, as we have also revised our
aggregate supply assumptions in this forecast.
 We expect the lower marginal tax rates on labor income and the corporate tax
cuts to boost the level of potential output in 2020 by 0.35 percent, about
¼ percentage point more than we assumed in the December Tealbook.5
 All told, potential GDP growth is projected to move up from about 1½ percent
in 2017 to just under 2 percent by the end of the medium term.
 With the growth of real GDP substantially outpacing that of potential GDP
throughout much of the projection, resource utilization tightens significantly
further. At the end of 2020, real GDP is projected to exceed its potential level
by 3¼ percent, 1¼ percentage points more than in the December projection.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
The two labor reports issued since the December Tealbook indicate that labor
market conditions continued to strengthen through the end of the year.6 We expect
further labor market tightening over the medium term, and to a greater extent than in the
December Tealbook projection.
5 A higher level of business investment spending in this projection that is unrelated to the tax cuts
also led us to raise slightly our estimate of capital deepening and structural productivity, which increases
the level of potential output an additional 0.1 percent by the end of 2020.

FOMC meeting.

 The unemployment rate held steady in November and December at
4.1 percent; it decreased 0.6 percentage point over the course of 2017.8 We
expect the unemployment rate to edge down over the next few months and to
average 3.8 percent during the second quarter, the same as in the December
Tealbook.
 The labor force participation rate (LFPR) also held steady in November and
December at 62.7 percent. Despite fluctuating over the course of 2017, the
LFPR ended the year at the same level as in December 2016; compared with
its declining trend, this sideways movement represents a continued tightening
along this margin.
Over the medium term, we expect the labor market to tighten significantly further.
 We have marked up the expected pace of payroll increases a fair bit with the
stronger projected path for output. After having risen about 170,000 per
month in 2017, total payroll employment gains are expected to pick up to an
average monthly pace of about 195,000 this year, which is 15,000 higher than
in the December Tealbook, and then to slow gradually, reaching 150,000
in 2020, in line with the deceleration in real GDP.
 Similarly, we have marked down the unemployment rate over the projection
period. The jobless rate declines to 3.4 percent by the end of this year (and
7 For 2017 as a whole, monthly payroll gains averaged 171,000, down about 15,000 from 2016.
The modest decline reflects a deceleration in government payrolls. Private payroll gains averaged 168,000,
just 2,000 fewer than in 2016.
8 The decline over the past year was widespread across racial and ethnic groups, and the
unemployment rate for African Americans in December, at 6.8 percent, was the lowest rate in the history of
the series (back to 1972).

flat at its current level of 62.7 percent over the medium term, ending 2020
0.5 percentage point above our estimate of its trend and 0.3 percentage point
above our projection in the December Tealbook.
 Over the medium term, the labor market continues to strengthen along many
dimensions, including the unemployment rate, the LFPR, and the workweek.
However, given how strained we think labor resources are likely to be in a
couple of years, we elected to have a larger-than-usual amount of this
improvement manifest in the LFPR and the workweek and less in the
unemployment rate.9 We have not, however, assumed that labor resources
will be sufficiently strained to importantly impinge on the overall GDP
outlook.
9 Specifically, had we maintained our usual Okun’s law relationship throughout the medium term,
revisions to the output gap since the December Tealbook would have led us to lower the unemployment
rate to 3.0 percent in 2020. Deviating from our Okun’s law relationship in an especially tight economy is
consistent with research showing that, in the very strong economies of the late 1960s and 1990s, additional
output growth tended to reduce the unemployment rate by less. See Brent Meyer and Murat Tasci (2012),

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION u t
O
&
On balance, the incoming information regarding core consumer prices has been
l
e
v
about as we anticipated, with core PCE prices a little lower than expected in November e
D
and the core CPI in December somewhat higher.10 n
o
c
E
c
 We continue to estimate that core PCE prices increased 1.5 percent over the ti
s
e
12 months ending in December and that total PCE prices rose 1.7 percent, m
o
D
with each measure up about ¼ percentage point from its low last summer. We
continue to think that the soft core inflation readings seen last year reflect
idiosyncratic factors that will not persist, and we expect inflation to move
higher this year.
 We expect the 12-month change in core PCE prices to fluctuate around its
current level until March 2018, when it moves up to 1.7 percent, as the
unusually low reading in that month last year drops out of the calculation; we
then expect the 12-month change to edge up to 1.9 percent by midyear.
 Gasoline prices ended the year a little lower than projected in the December
Tealbook, but oil prices have increased, which boosts the projection for PCE
energy prices, and thus total PCE price inflation, in the coming months. We
now expect the 12-month change in total PCE prices to rise from 1.7 percent
in December to 2.2 percent in June and to then ease back a bit later in
the year, in line with core inflation.
 Core import prices rose at an estimated 1½ percent pace over the second half
of 2017, less than would have been expected given last year’s movements in
the dollar and commodity prices; we expect core import price inflation to pick
up to a 2¾ percent pace in the first half of 2018, supported by recent dollar
depreciation and higher commodity prices. Thereafter, import price inflation
slows to a ¾ percent pace, consistent with still-moderate foreign inflation, a
gradually appreciating dollar, and slowly declining commodity prices.
10 The core CPI in December rose a relatively large 0.3 percent, but our translation of the CPI and
low readings on the relevant PPI data point to a 0.1 percent increase in core PCE prices last month, only a
couple of basis points higher than our December Tealbook projection.

o
o
t l  Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved
u
O
little since the time of the December Tealbook and, on balance, relative to a
&
l
e year or so earlier. Median 10-year inflation expectations for PCE prices in the
v
e
D fourth-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters were stable at 2.0 percent
n
o and have been essentially unchanged for the past several years. The median
c
E
c of expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey ticked
ti
s
e up to 2.5 percent in early January; this measure trended down from 2014 into
m
o 2016 but has been relatively stable since then. The 3-year-ahead measure of
D
inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of
Consumer Expectations, which also trended down into 2016 before moving up
a bit, rose 0.1 percentage point in December to 2.9 percent, a value toward the
higher end of its range of the past year or so. Finally, the TIPS-based measure
of 5-to-10-year-forward inflation compensation increased 0.1 percentage point
to about 2 percent over the intermeeting period, but it remains little changed,
on net, since late 2016.
Core PCE price inflation is projected to move up from 1.5 percent in 2017 to
1.9 percent in 2018, with the increase reflecting the abating of last year’s surprising
weakness and the tightening economy. We expect core inflation to move up to
2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020 as resource utilization tightens substantially further. Total
PCE price inflation also rises over the medium term, from 1.9 percent this year and next
to 2.0 percent in 2020. The medium-term forecast for core PCE price inflation is revised
up 0.1 percentage point in each year in light of the stronger outlook for resource
utilization in this projection.
The limited new information regarding labor compensation has been a bit weaker
than we expected.
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose
2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in December, a pace similar to that in
2016 and a bit less than we anticipated. The 12-month change in this measure
is forecast to remain around 2½ percent over the next few months, above its
average of roughly 2 percent earlier in the expansion.
 We estimate that compensation per hour (CPH) in the business sector rose
2½ percent over the four quarters of 2017. We currently project CPH growth

 The employment cost index (ECI) rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending e
D
in September and has shown some acceleration relative to its pace of recent n
o
c
years.11 The ECI, which is less cyclically sensitive than CPH, is projected to E

bit higher than in our previous projection.
o
D
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was
3.2 percent in November, toward the low end of the range it has traversed
during the past couple of years but up from earlier years.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be
4.7 percent and that potential output growth will be 1.7 percent in the longer
run. However, we have adjusted up potential output growth from 2021
through 2023 to be consistent with the effects of the TCJA in the medium
term.
 We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. While some of the
tax changes are anticipated to persist, the baseline projection assumes that
other budget adjustments will eventually be implemented such that the federal
debt stabilizes in the long run, although at a higher level. To reflect that
higher level of federal debt, we have revised up the assumed term premium on
10-year Treasury yields in the longer run by 25 basis points.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by mid-2021.
11 The ECI for the period ending in December is scheduled to be published on January 31, the
second day of the FOMC meeting.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The outlook for foreign growth remains upbeat and is notably stronger than we
anticipated in the December Tealbook, reflecting solid incoming data and expectations of
positive spillovers from the recently passed U.S. tax package. We estimate that real
foreign GDP growth rose to 3 percent at an annual rate last quarter after dipping in the
third quarter, held down by natural disasters in Mexico. We project that growth will
remain near 3 percent in 2018 before moderating to 2¾ percent in 2019 and 2020,
supported by buoyant financial markets, accommodative monetary policies, and a strong
k
o
U.S. economy. Relative to the December Tealbook, our foreign growth outlook is about o
l
t
u
¼ percentage point higher over the next few quarters and a bit less thereafter, reflecting O
&
stronger-than-expected data and the upward revision to the U.S. outlook.
l
e
v
e
D
In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), despite the firm economic expansion,
n
o
underlying inflation in some countries shows little sign of a sustained pickup. Strong c
E
l
global demand has boosted the price of oil and other commodities, helping raise t ’
n
I
aggregate AFE headline inflation to an annual rate above 2 percent in the fourth quarter,
but core inflation moved lower in the euro area and appears to have remained near zero in
Japan. Consequently, we still expect the Bank of Japan to leave its short-term rates
unchanged over the forecast period. Recent communications from the European Central
Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC) highlighted the strength of their economies,
and we marked up the projected path of monetary policy in these economies a touch. We
now project ECB liftoff in the first quarter of 2019, one quarter earlier than assumed in
the December Tealbook, and we have penciled in an additional 25 basis point hike by the
BOC in 2019.
In the emerging market economies, headline inflation has also been boosted by
rising oil prices. Mexico’s inflation is down since the beginning of last year but remains
well above its 3 percent target, raising concerns about underlying inflationary pressures.
Consequently, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) raised its policy rate another 25 basis points in
December.
The upbeat foreign growth forecast is not without risks. In addition to perpetual
concerns about a Chinese hard landing, with market valuations at high levels in many
economies, financial markets could suffer a correction. We explore this risk in the
Page 35 of 118

--- Page 39 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) January 19, 2018
“Global Market Correction” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
But there is also upside potential to our outlook, as the strong momentum of the global
economy suggests that foreign growth could again positively surprise us. In this case,
AFE central banks might normalize monetary policy more aggressively than our baseline
rules would call for, and we explore the potential ramifications of this situation in the
“Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy” alternative scenario.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Canada. We estimate that GDP growth edged up to 2 percent in the fourth quarter.
Although this pace is slightly below our December forecast—partly reflecting
k
o
o disruptions in the auto and oil industries—indicators from late in the quarter, such as
l
t
u the December labor force survey, were buoyant. Boosted by domestic momentum
O
& and strong foreign demand, growth is expected to step up to 2¼ percent in 2018
l
e
v before slowing to just below 2 percent in 2020. Relative to the December Tealbook,
e
D
this projection is nearly ¼ percentage point higher over the next three years, largely
n
o
c because of stronger projected U.S. demand.
E
l
’
t
n
I The BOC raised its policy rate 25 basis points to 1.25 percent at its January meeting,
as we expected, alluding to rising inflation and diminishing labor market slack.
Given the brighter growth outlook, we have added an additional rate hike of 25 basis
points in 2019, taking our projection of the policy rate to 3 percent by mid-2020.
• Euro area. Economic indicators—including PMIs, confidence surveys, and
industrial production—continue to point to surprising strength. We estimate that the
euro-area economy expanded at a 2½ percent pace in the fourth quarter. We expect
GDP growth to proceed at a similar pace this quarter before decelerating gradually to
1¾ percent in 2019, around our estimate of potential. Compared with December, this
path is up ½ percentage point and nearly ¼ percentage point in 2018 and 2019,
respectively, as a result of the stronger domestic momentum and external demand.
Despite robust growth and tightening labor markets, core inflation remained weak and
dropped to 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter at an annual rate, in part because of
idiosyncratic factors such as a one-off decline in education fees. In contrast, headline
inflation jumped from 1 percent to 1.7 percent as a result of higher retail energy
prices. Headline inflation is projected to fall back this year before gradually climbing
Page 36 of 118

--- Page 40 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) January 19, 2018
again to 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, still below the ECB’s target of
2 percent.
• United Kingdom. Solid economic indicators, including PMIs, consumer confidence,
and industrial production, suggest that real GDP growth edged up slightly to
1¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. We project that growth will stay close to
this pace over the first half of 2018, decelerate modestly to about 1½ percent by the
first quarter of 2019, and then stay at about that rate thereafter. Brexit will officially
take effect in March 2019, followed by a transition period that is still being
negotiated. We estimate Brexit should hold down potential growth about
0.3 percentage point in coming years.
k
o
o
l
t
Inflation is expected to inch down from 3 percent in the fourth quarter to 2¾ percent u
O
in the current quarter and to continue falling gradually—as the boost from higher oil &
l
e
prices and pass-through from earlier sterling depreciation fades—until reaching the v
e
D
Bank of England’s (BOE) 2 percent target in the second half of 2020. In line with its
n
o
announced forward guidance, the BOE is expected to raise its policy rate only c
E
l
gradually over the next few years, reaching a mere 1¼ percent by the end of 2020. t ’
n
I
• Japan. Even though we still see real GDP as having decelerated in the fourth quarter,
the upbeat tone of recent data, including private consumption data through
November, led us to substantially boost our fourth-quarter growth estimate to
2 percent, well above our potential growth estimate of ¾ percent. Given this stronger
domestic momentum and the higher forecast for global growth, we also revised up
our outlook for the Japanese economy a bit thereafter. Even so, we see growth
moderating further to a more sustainable 1 percent pace in 2018 and, following the
implementation of a long-planned consumption tax hike, temporarily falling to only
¼ percent in 2019.
We estimate that total inflation increased sharply to 2¼ percent at an annual rate in
the fourth quarter from just 0.4 percent in the third, reflecting a surge in retail energy
prices. Core inflation remained disappointingly weak at less than ½ percent. With
extremely tight labor markets still failing to revive underlying inflation, we slightly
lowered the forecast for 2018 and 2019 and have inflation rising to only 1 percent by
the end of the forecast period. We continue to assume that monetary policy will
remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. Real GDP growth edged up to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly above
our December Tealbook forecast. Growth was boosted by relatively strong exports,
which helped offset the drag from domestic credit tightening and curbs on production
in heavily polluting industries. We expect domestic demand growth to continue to
trend downward as Chinese authorities move cautiously to address risks in the
financial sector and property market and to curtail local government spending.
Slower domestic demand growth should be partly offset by strong external demand.
As such, we see growth slowing only slightly this year to a bit above the authorities’
reported 6½ percent growth target before edging down to 6 percent by 2020. This
k
o
o path is about ¼ percentage point above that in the December Tealbook as a result of
l
t
u
O incoming data and further projected strengthening of external demand.
&
l
e
v We estimate that inflation rose to 3½ percent in the fourth quarter from very subdued
e
D
levels earlier in 2017, as both food and energy inflation increased. We see inflation
n
o
c moving back down to its longer-term trend of 2½ percent by the middle of this year.
E
l
’
t
n
I • Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP growth moderated to 4½ percent
in the fourth quarter from 5.1 percent in the third quarter but is still above our
estimate of trend growth. Although export growth stepped down after surging in the
third quarter, strong PMI readings—including new export orders—suggest that
manufacturing activity in emerging Asia retains plenty of momentum. This
momentum, together with the stronger projected demand from the advanced
economies, led us to revise up growth ¼ percentage point this year and a touch over
the remainder of the forecast period. We now see growth at 4 percent this year before
slowing to a trendlike 3¾ percent pace by 2020.
• Mexico. We estimate that real GDP growth rebounded to 2¾ percent last quarter
following a contraction related to the hurricane and earthquake in September. This
rebound is smaller than we had projected in December; while manufacturing exports
have picked up and oil production has resumed, construction activity in the wake of
the earthquake has remained weak. However, we see relatively strong 3¼ percent
growth in the first half of this year, about ½ percentage point higher than our
December Tealbook projection, reflecting the upward revisions to the forecast for
U.S. manufacturing production. Thereafter, growth should moderate a bit as tighter
Mexican monetary policy partially offsets the effects of stronger external demand.

Uncertainty about the future of NAFTA and the Mexican presidential election in July
add significant downside risk to this outlook.
Although quarterly inflation rates have come down since early last year, they have
done so only slowly, and base effects helped push 12-month inflation to a 17-year
high of 6.8 percent in December. In response, the BOM raised its policy rate 25 basis
points to 7¼ percent at its December meeting, the first meeting under its new
governor, Alejandro Díaz de León. We expect the BOM to raise its policy rate
further in its next two meetings by a cumulative 50 basis points. Next year, as
inflation declines, we expect the BOM to begin easing policy.
k
o
o
• Brazil. Real GDP growth is estimated to have moved up to 1½ percent in the fourth t l
u
O
quarter from only 0.6 percent in the third. Tumbling retail sales in October point to a
&
l
weak start to the quarter, although subsequent data releases have been more positive. e
v
e
We expect growth to increase to 2½ percent in 2018, boosted by last year’s D
n
considerable monetary policy easing but somewhat constrained by the short-run costs o
c
E
of fiscal reform efforts and political uncertainty stemming from elections this l
’
t
n
October. We see growth rising to 3 percent in 2019 as this uncertainty fades. I
Relative to the December Tealbook, growth is ½ percentage point higher in 2018
and 2019.
Headline inflation in Brazil was about 3 percent last year, well below the target of
4½ percent. Amid substantial resource slack, core inflation was subdued, while
headline inflation was further restrained by falling food prices. As food prices
normalize, we see inflation rising to a still-benign 4¼ percent in the current quarter
and remaining around that pace over the forecast period. With inflation contained
and activity weak, the Central Bank of Brazil cut its policy rate 50 basis points to
7 percent in December. We expect one more 25 basis point cut before the easing
cycle ends, bringing the cumulative reduction in the policy rate since September 2016
to 7½ percentage points.

Financial Market Developments
Treasury yields and prices of domestic equities have risen substantially on net
since the December FOMC meeting, boosted in part by investor perceptions of a
strengthening growth outlook in the United States and abroad. Measures of inflation
compensation also rose amid further dollar depreciation and higher commodity prices.
FOMC communications over the period appear to have had little effect on financial
markets.
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability of a rate hike at
the January FOMC meeting remained close to zero, while the probability of a
rate increase in March rose to 80 percent.
 The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year
Treasury yields all rising about 20 basis points on net.
 The rise in nominal yields was about evenly split between increases in real
yields and inflation compensation, with TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation rising 10 basis points at the 5-year horizon and 16 basis points
at the 5-to-10-year horizon.
s
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 5 percent, led by the energy e t
k
r
and consumer retail sector. The VIX edged up but remained near its historical a
M
low. Credit spreads on both investment- and speculative-grade corporate a l
ci
bonds remained low. n

 The broad dollar depreciated 3 percent amid strong foreign data releases and
monetary policy communications that were less accommodative than expected
in some economies. Foreign equity markets were buoyed by positive
economic data and, especially in the emerging markets, rising commodity
prices.
 Conditions in money markets were reported to have remained orderly over
year-end, although offshore dollar funding markets were somewhat volatile.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
Over the intermeeting period, FOMC communications were generally viewed by
market participants as consistent with their expectations for continued gradual removal of
monetary policy accommodation and did not prompt significant price action. The
Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the December
meeting was widely expected. Nonetheless, market commentaries highlighted that the
median projections in the Summary of Economic Projections for the federal funds rate at
the end of 2018 and 2019 were unchanged from September, even though the median
projections for real GDP growth over the next three years were revised up and the median
projections for the unemployment rate were revised down.
Domestic data releases over this period were somewhat stronger than expected on
balance. Both November and December retail sales printed above market consensus
forecasts. Core CPI inflation was softer than expected for November but came in above
expectations for December. The BLS Employment Situation release for December was
seen as slightly weaker than expected, on net, but was not cited by investors as materially
changing their outlook for the domestic economy or near-term monetary policy.
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts shows that market
participants continued to place essentially zero probability on an increase in the target
s
t
e
range for the federal funds rate at the January meeting. The probability of a rate hike at k
r
a
the March meeting increased from around 60 percent immediately following the M

December FOMC meeting to 80 percent. Further out, the OIS-implied federal funds rates ci
n
at the end of 2018 and 2019 moved up 14 basis points and 26 basis points, respectively, a

with a staff model attributing about half of the increases to less negative term premiums.
The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeting period amid
investor perceptions of an improved domestic and foreign growth outlook and less
accommodative monetary policy abroad, with the 2- and 10-year yields both increasing
about 20 basis points. The 10-year yield is now at its highest level since March 2017,
while the spread between 2- and 10-year yields remained at around the 40th percentile of
its distribution since data first became available in August 1971 (see the box “The
International Experience with Inverted Yield Curves” for an international perspective on
the slope of the yield curve). Treasury yields rose noticeably over the two days leading
up to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but market reports did not point to the tax

The International Experience with Inverted Yield Curves
In the extended Tealbook outlook, the federal funds rate surpasses the 10-year Treasury yield
starting in 2020, resulting in an inverted yield curve that lasts into 2026. While such prolonged
yield curve inversion is unusual for the United States, some advanced foreign economies
(AFEs) have had such inversions.1 In this discussion, we examine these experiences as they
relate both to recessions and to bank performance.
Over the past 20 years for which we have reliable data, we find nine episodes in five AFEs
where the yield curve was inverted for eight months or longer (see the table).2 As the
academic literature suggests, inversion episodes are not perfect predictors of incipient
recessions: Only three inversion episodes were associated with recessions.3 In all episodes, a
monetary policy tightening coincided with or preceded an inversion episode. In addition, in
some cases—for example, the mid-2000s inversions in Australia and the United Kingdom—a
compression in term premiums contributed to yield curve inversions.4

FFii
1 The yield curve slope is defined as the spread between 10-year and 3-month sovereign yields.
2 These and other AFEs experienced prolonged inversions in earlier periods, but data limitations and
different banking environments make these inversions harder to analyze and less relevant.
3 Over the same period, the United States experienced three shorter yield curve inversions, all followed
by recessions. Since 1962, in every U.S. episode when a yield curve inversion preceded a recession, the FOMC
had increased the federal funds rate, in many instances with the goal of curbing significant inflation pressures
even at the cost of a recession. For details, see the box “Why Is the Yield Curve Inverted in the Tealbook
Projection?” in the December 2017 Tealbook.
4 The compressions were attributed to low term premiums around the world and heavy demand for
longer-duration assets from institutional investors.
5 This period better captures more-recent bank business models and operating environments, the
available bank data are more complete, and the level and slope of the yield curves in these episodes are
comparable with those projected for the United States in the extended Tealbook outlook.

shows that the association between net interest rate margins (or broader profitability
metrics) and the slope of the yield curve was positive but not statistically significant.6 The
yield curve inversions also did not appear to adversely affect bank profitability. In addition,
there is little or no systematic association between yield curve inversions and indicators of
bank soundness, such as the ratio of nonperforming loans to gross loans and provisions for
loan losses to gross loans, or reliable signs of capital erosion. Echoing this result, financial
stability reports of the mid-2000s by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England as
well as contemporaneous International Monetary Fund reports do not mention yield curve
inversion as a risk to banks.
A few factors may explain these benign outcomes. First, for the banking systems in these
episodes, long-term loans are largely priced as a markup over benchmark short-term interest
rates: Interest payments on such loans adjust on a set schedule so that they generally reflect
changes in benchmark interest rates. In particular, residential mortgage loans (which account
for the bulk of bank lending) and business loans tend to be variable-rate loans that are priced
off short-term rates.7 Only holdings of securities and a moderate portion of loans are priced
off longer-term rates. Second, banks’ liabilities are also largely priced off short-term rates.
For example, deposits, which mostly have short maturities, account for the bulk of banks’
liabilities.8 In addition, larger banks reportedly swap fixed interest rate payments on their
bonds to variable interest rate payments, which are tied to short-term interest rates.
Therefore, because loans and, effectively, liabilities are generally priced off short-term
interest rates, banks’ profits tend to be insulated from changes in the slope of the yield curve.
Although these past international experiences are somewhat comforting, it is unclear how
directly applicable they are for the implications of the extended Tealbook outlook. U.S.
commercial banks operate in a different regulatory environment, face different competitive s
t
e
pressures, and have different business model and lending practices.9 For example, a larger k
r
portion of U.S. loan supply is likely priced off longer-term rates. That said, the foreign a
M
experiences do suggest that banks can operate in ways that limit the negative effects of l
a
prolonged yield curve inversions. ci

7 Interest rates on mortgage loans are variable in Australia, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom,
and fixed or variable in Canada. See Eugenio Cerutti, Jihad Dagher, and Giovanni Dell’Ariccia (2015), “Housing

temporarily boost bank profitability.

bill as a major driver for those increases, and the final passage of the tax bill did not
prompt any reaction in Treasury markets. About half of the increases in nominal yields
over the intermeeting period reflected higher real yields, as 5- and 10-year TIPS yields
rose 13 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively. Measures of option-implied
volatility on interest rates were little changed, on net, and remained near historically low
levels. The Treasury bill market showed modest signs of pressure from concerns about
the debt ceiling (see the box “Projections for Federal Debt Subject to Limit”).
TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation rose 10 basis points at the 5-year
horizon and 16 basis points at the 5-to-10-year horizon. Both measures are now back to
their levels in early 2017 before the start of the recent trend of mostly weaker-than-
expected CPI readings. Inflation compensation fell in response to the November core
CPI data release that came in below expectations but subsequently moved up against the
backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, a weakening
dollar, and the stronger-than-expected December core CPI release. Meanwhile, estimates
of expected inflation based on the staff’s real term structure model edged up.
Option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon MBS over Treasury yields were
little changed over the intermeeting period. Investors continued to see the ongoing
normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as leaving little imprint on MBS
and Treasury yields.1

remained very low by historical standards.

directive, monthly caps on SOMA securities reductions were increased to $12 billion for Treasury
securities and to $8 billion for agency securities in January.
2 Despite higher stock prices, the staff’s estimate of expected 10-year real return on the S&P 500
index—which increases when earnings rise faster than prices—ticked higher, reflecting an upward revision
in the staff’s projection for after-tax earnings following the new tax legislation.

Projections for Federal Debt Subject to Limit
The statutory debt limit has been binding since December 8, 2017. The Treasury
Department has been able to continue operations through its use of extraordinary
measures.
Forecasts of when the Treasury will exhaust extraordinary measures and be unable to meet
its obligations are subject to considerable uncertainty. The usual uncertainty associated
with the timing of refunds during the spring tax-filing season is currently compounded by
uncertainty created by the recently passed tax bill that will affect a variety of the Treasury’s
cash flows.
The staff projection calls for the Treasury to deplete its remaining extraordinary measures
by the end of February, assuming no legislation is passed.1 By early March, the Treasury’s
cash on hand is expected to cover payments for, at most, a few additional days (see figure).
At this point, pressures in financial markets related to the debt ceiling appear fairly modest.
Yields on Treasury bills maturing in early March have risen and are currently 7 basis points
higher than the mid-February bill; moreover, yields on potentially at-risk Treasury bills have
moved higher than yields on agency discount notes with comparable maturity dates.

Yield spreads on triple-B-rated corporate bonds over comparable-maturity
Treasury securities remained well below their historical median level, while spreads on
speculative-grade bonds stayed near the bottom of their historical range.
Foreign Developments
Since the December FOMC meeting, positive foreign economic data and
improved risk sentiment pushed risky asset prices higher. Against this backdrop, foreign
yields rose, in some cases supported by central bank communications. These
developments weighed on the dollar, which continued to depreciate against most
currencies. On balance, the broad nominal dollar index declined 3 percent.
Longer-term sovereign yields moved up in most AFEs, especially in Canada and
Germany, driven by both higher term premiums and expectations for less accommodative
monetary policy. Market-based policy rate expectations for Canada moved up over the
intermeeting period, especially in response to higher inflation and stronger employment
data, and on January 17, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate 25 basis points. The
Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) left their
monetary policy stances unchanged. However, ECB communications were interpreted as
less accommodative than expected, and market-based policy expectations moved up
moderately in the euro area, though such measures continue to indicate a very gradual
pace of monetary policy normalization.

The cost of offshore dollar funding implied by currency swaps increased sharply
in late December and reached multiyear highs, reportedly as several major financial
institutions, including some U.S. banks, were reluctant to expand their balance sheets at
year-end. Although market participants were surprised by the volatile funding costs, the
volume traded at these high prices was reportedly low. Against this backdrop, the
December take-up at the ECB swap facility was higher than in recent years, although it
remained well below levels observed during the European debt crisis or the Global
Financial Crisis. Measures of implied dollar funding costs quickly returned to more

to very modest levels in the second week of January.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Similar to previous increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, the
December policy rate increase was transmitted smoothly to money market rates. Overall,
both the effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate held steady at
around 1.42 percent except at year-end. Since year-end, take-up at the ON RRP facility
has remained close to the lower end of its historical range, reportedly because strong
demand from dealers for repo financing has pushed market repo rates higher relative to
the ON RRP rate.
Money market rates and volumes exhibited typical year-end dynamics that
quickly faded. Similar to recent year-ends, rates and volumes in federal funds and
Eurodollar markets declined on December 29, while in secured markets, Treasury repo
rates increased. Spreads between longer-term unsecured commercial paper rates and the
corresponding OIS rates widened somewhat toward the end of 2017 amid low volumes.
At year-end, ON RRP take-up increased $162 billion from the previous day operation, to
$320 billion, roughly in line with recent quarter-ends. As expected, government MMFs
were the predominant participants in the operation, given the reduction in dealer
borrowing on financial reporting days. After year-end, pressures in money markets
s
t
e
abated quickly, and rates and volumes returned to recent non-year-end ranges. k

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained
generally accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to be supportive of
economic activity.
• Net debt financing flows to nonfinancial firms turned negative in December,
but the weakness appears to be demand driven and concentrated among larger,
higher-rated firms.
• The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
(SLOOS) suggests that the sluggish commercial and industrial (C&I) loan
growth over the past quarter was demand driven: Banks reported weaker
demand from medium and large borrowers while also reporting easing of
standards on these loans.1
• Outstanding consumer credit accelerated in November—following the robust
growth observed earlier in the fall—mainly reflecting a very large expansion
in revolving credit balances.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
Overall, financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained quite
accommodative over the intermeeting period. Spreads on both high-yield bonds and on
newly issued institutional leveraged loans have remained near their post-crisis lows.
In addition, respondents to the SLOOS indicated a net easing of standards and terms on
C&I loans due in part to increased competition from other lenders.
Despite accommodative conditions, net funds raised by nonfinancial corporations
through debt instruments turned decidedly negative in December. The overall decline in

that month reflects negative net bond issuance and a drop in outstanding commercial
paper, whereas C&I and leveraged loans were both about unchanged over the month.
While the negative net debt financing in December may have been driven in part
by unusually severe year-end effects, it could also reflect a softening in the demand for
credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher post-tax cash flows and repatriation
of foreign funds. Indeed, the decline in gross issuance of corporate bonds in December
was in the investment-grade segment only, where issuance is more likely driven by shifts
in financing demand than credit supply. In contrast, gross issuance of speculative-grade
bonds and institutional leveraged loans both remained strong. SLOOS respondents
widely reported weak demand for C&I loans in the fourth quarter, particularly from large
firms. Respondents attributed this weak demand in part to firms drawing on internally
generated funds.
In a set of special questions in the SLOOS inquiring about the outlook for 2018,
respondent banks forecast that demand for C&I loans from small firms would rise over
the next year but would remain basically unchanged, on net, for large and middle-market
firms. Banks also indicated that in 2018 they expected to further ease standards for larger
firms but leave lending standards for small firms basically unchanged.
Corporate earnings growth is estimated to have been sizable in the fourth quarter.
Wall Street analyst forecasts for fourth-quarter earnings and reports to date imply about a
5 percent (seasonally adjusted) earnings-per-share gain among S&P 500 firms, or
20 percent at an annual rate. The rise in part reflects a jump in energy-sector earnings
from the recent upswing in oil prices. Looking forward, analysts have been revising
projections of year-ahead earnings notably higher as they incorporate the effects of the
passage of the tax bill. These upward revisions are expected to continue for some time,
as forecast adjustments have not yet fully incorporated the direct effects of the tax
legislation on after-tax earnings.
Nonfinancial corporations deployed available funds more aggressively over the
s
last quarter of 2017, with the volume of announced stock repurchases coming in notably n

Small Businesses
Overall, small business credit market conditions were little changed and still
relatively accommodative over the intermeeting period. Recent indicators of loan
performance have remained strong, and credit quality concerns are not expected to be a
significant factor affecting the ability of small businesses to obtain credit in the near term.
However, credit growth remained sluggish, with data suggesting this sluggishness is
largely due to continued weak demand for credit by small businesses.
Commercial Real Estate
Growth of commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by banks slowed further in the
fourth quarter. Growth of multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loans from large
banks, which had been slowing all year, turned negative in the fourth quarter. In contrast,
CRE loans from small banks and construction loans from large banks expanded at a more
robust pace. On balance, SLOOS respondents did not indicate any significant changes in
demand or lending standards for CRE loans over the fourth quarter, nor did they indicate
that they expected to change their standards for CRE loans this year.
Financing conditions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
market remained accommodative, and CMBS issuance continued at a robust pace in the
fourth quarter. Spreads on CMBS generally held steady during the intermeeting period,
near their lowest levels since the financial crisis. Also, delinquency rates on loans in
CMBS pools continued to decline in November, largely reflecting the shrinking share of
risky loans that originated before the financial crisis. However, in contrast to the largely
sanguine conditions, spreads on junior tranches of CMBX that are heavily exposed to the
challenged brick-and-mortar retail sector remained high but tightened modestly.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also remained accommodative
on balance. In the final stages of the new tax bill, uncertainty over the tax-exempt status
of the interest earned on private activity bonds (PABs) led to a surge in municipal bond
s
issuance in December on the presumption that these bonds would have been n
o
grandfathered in.2 However, the final tax bill preserved the tax-exempt status of PABs. di

In December, the credit quality of municipal bonds held steady, with the number of
ratings upgrades slightly outpacing that of rating downgrades.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative
for most borrowers. Although the rate on 30-year conforming mortgages offered to well-
qualified borrowers rose 16 basis points over the intermeeting period (in line with
benchmark yields), the rate remained quite low by historical standards. Mortgage
originations for home purchases continued to rebound in November and, after having
stepped down over the summer, came back in line with the steady growth trend of recent
years. Originations of loans with a high debt-to-income ratio have picked up some in
recent months, reflecting an easing of credit standards for well-qualified borrowers
instituted by Fannie Mae last July.3 However, credit standards remained tight for
borrowers with low credit scores or with hard-to-document incomes. Banks reported that
demand and lending standards for most mortgage categories were little changed in recent
months, although demand for jumbo loans reportedly weakened.
Consumer Credit
Overall, financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely
supportive of economic activity. Indeed, as retail sales posted strong growth in recent
months, consumer credit increased notably in November, exceeding the more moderate
volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year. Revolving credit expanded at a
particularly brisk pace in November, while nonrevolving credit also grew robustly,
mainly driven by expansion in student and other consumer loans. In contrast, auto
lending flows slowed in recent months, consistent with the weakening demand for such
loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the January SLOOS.
Credit card interest rates continued to trend up over the past few months,
consistent with short-term market interest rates. Auto loan interest rates reported by car
s
dealers also edged up, on net, during the intermeeting period. n

above 45 percent then climbed from about 20 percent in July to over 25 percent in December. Fi

For subprime borrowers, conditions in the credit card market remained tight,
while conditions in the market for auto loans have tightened considerably over the past
year. Indeed, the January SLOOS indicated that banks’ standards on both credit card and
auto loans were reportedly tightened in the fourth quarter. Over the coming year, banks
expect to continue to tighten standards on credit card and auto loans and also anticipate
that the credit performance of these types of loans will deteriorate.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n
U
&
As in the December Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of s
k
s
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark Ri
used by the FOMC. Many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted as
reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued. Corporate bond spreads and
the VIX remain near the low end of their historical ranges. The enactment of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, following the December Tealbook, has diminished the uncertainty
regarding fiscal policy effects, although ambiguity remains about the future direction of a
number of other federal policies.
We continue to judge the risks around our projections for both real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate as being balanced. Consistent with that view, estimates of the
distribution of risks around those forecasts conditional on available indicators, shown in
the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly skewed.
Moreover, as presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the risk of
returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three years is
estimated from stochastic simulations around the baseline path in the FRB/US model to
be about 11 percent.1
With regard to inflation, we still see the current level of uncertainty around our
projection as in line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside
and upside as roughly balanced. To the downside, last year’s string of soft readings on
inflation could prove to be more persistent than we have assumed. Also, we think there is
a risk that inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could be lower
currently than in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming years as we have
assumed. To the upside, with the economy projected to be moving further above its long-
run potential, inflation may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the
predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.
1 If the ELB risk were computed around a lower path for the federal funds rate, then the
probability naturally would be higher. For example, the probability is 22 percent if calculated using the
median federal funds rates from the FOMC’s December Survey of Economic Projections.

Our judgmental assessments of typical uncertainty and balanced risks are consistent with
y
n t the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.
ai
t
r
e
c Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
n
U
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the overall financial vulnerabilities in
&
s
k the United States and overseas to be moderate. Asset valuations have increased further
s
Ri
from already elevated levels both here and in a number of foreign economies. However,
these valuation pressures have generally not been accompanied by an increase in other
vulnerabilities. While leverage in the U.S. nonfinancial business sector remained
elevated in the fourth quarter with additional net issuance of risky debt, overall borrowing
in the nonfinancial sector continued to advance at a slower pace than nominal GDP.
Vulnerabilities from leverage in the financial system appear low, as both banks and
insurance companies are highly capitalized by historical standards. Nevertheless, there is
some evidence that dealers have eased price terms to hedge funds and real estate
investment trusts, or REITs, and that leverage used by hedge funds has gradually
increased. Vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity transformation remain low, partly
because banks continue to hold substantial amounts of high-quality liquid assets that
exceed their liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Moreover, the level of assets under
management at prime money market funds has held steady since the October 2016
reform, and growth of alternative short-term investment vehicles appears to have
been weak.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first two scenarios illustrate
some of the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic effects of the Tax Cut and Jobs
Act. In the first scenario, the effects on the economy are larger as investment and labor
supply respond more than in the baseline. In contrast, in the second scenario, supply
constraints in tight labor and product markets, together with a lower marginal propensity
to consume, weaken the economic effects of the tax reform. The third scenario illustrates
the consequences of a lower natural rate of unemployment that is initially misperceived
by the central bank. In the fourth scenario, we study a downside risk for inflation in
which households and businesses have lower inflation expectations than in the baseline
because they perceive that monetary policy will be too tight to return inflation to the
FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. In contrast, the fifth scenario

examines the upside risk that the response of wages and prices to the further tightening of
y
labor market conditions will be stronger than we have assumed, and that inflation n t
ai
expectations will be more responsive to a rise in actual inflation. In the sixth scenario, t
r
e
c
we present the implications of a substantial correction in global asset valuations. The last n
U
scenario considers the effects of stronger foreign economic growth in combination with a &
s
faster normalization of monetary policy in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). k
s
Ri
We simulate these scenarios using three staff models.2 In all of the scenarios, the
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline. In addition, the
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in
all of the scenarios.
Larger Effects of the Tax Reform [FRB/US]
There is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of the recent
tax reform. This scenario illustrates the possibility that the effects could be stronger than
we have projected. We assume that the reduction in personal income taxes raises labor
supply faster than in the baseline. In particular, the total increase in labor supply is
completed by the end of 2020, three years earlier than in the baseline. In addition,
investment is assumed to be more responsive to the change in the user cost of capital than
in the judgmental projection, similar to the parameterization in FRB/US and some outside
estimates. Furthermore, the tax legislation leads to a small boost in the trend growth of
multifactor productivity, linked to an increase in firm entry that the reform is assumed
to elicit.3
The stronger increase in aggregate supply boosts economic activity. However,
resource utilization is modestly tighter than in the baseline for some time, as actual output
rises more quickly than potential, raising the output gap about ½ percentage point above
the baseline in 2021. Real GDP growth peaks at 3¼ percent in mid-2018, and the
unemployment rate falls to 3 percent in mid-2020. With a relatively flat Phillips curve,

supply constraints might limit the fiscal impetus. Furthermore, consumers may spend
less and save more of the extra income from lower taxes than we assume in the baseline.
For instance, the personal income tax cuts are skewed toward high-income individuals
who may have a lower marginal propensity to consume, and we may have insufficiently
taken account of that distributional effect in the baseline. In this scenario, we assume the
reform boosts aggregate demand by half as much as in the baseline projection and that
the labor supply effect built into the baseline does not materialize.
Under these circumstances, the level of real GDP stands about ½ percent below
the baseline; the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point higher and the labor force
participation rate is 0.1 percentage point lower in 2021. Inflation is essentially
unchanged, while the narrower output gap leads to the federal funds rate being below the
baseline.
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [FRB/US]
In the baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to 3.2 percent in 2019, with
the natural rate of unemployment assumed to hold steady at 4.7 percent through the
projection period. However, the natural rate is estimated with considerable uncertainty
and could be lower. In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate has been 3¾ percent
for the past few years and will remain at that level in the future. Furthermore, we assume
that policymakers and the staff continue, for a time, to misperceive the level of the
natural rate; their perceptions converge to its true level only gradually and that
convergence is not complete by the end of 2023.
Given the lower natural rate, the unemployment rate in the scenario is below the
baseline path, falling to 2¾ percent in 2020, ½ percentage point below the baseline. Over
time, policymakers revise their view of the natural rate downward, but the gap between
the unemployment rate and the perceived natural rate is similar to the baseline. Given
that inflation is only a touch lower and the perceived output gap is about the same as in
the baseline, the path for the federal funds rate is little changed. Had policymakers fully

Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model]
Ri
Headline inflation, as measured by the change in personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) prices, has been below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for most
of the past five years. It has averaged about 1¼ percent during this period and has
remained subdued more recently even as resource utilization has exceeded our estimate
of its sustainable level. In the baseline projection, inflation is assumed to rebound this
year and to reach 2 percent in 2020, in part reflecting further tightening in resource
utilization and a small gradual rise in inflation expectations. However, in light of the
persistently low inflation of the past several years, there is a risk that the public perceives
the stance of monetary policy currently as being too tight, and as likely to remain so in
the future, to achieve the 2 percent target; for that reason, longer-run inflation
expectations in this scenario are assumed to be ¼ percentage point lower than in the
baseline.
Lower inflation expectations cause actual inflation to be lower than in the baseline
and to reach only 1.7 percent in 2020. Consequently, the federal funds rate increases less
than in the baseline, but given the inertia in the assumed policy rule, real interest rates as
perceived by the private sector are initially slightly higher. As a result, real GDP growth
is a touch lower in 2018 than in the baseline and the unemployment rate runs about
¼ percentage point higher in 2018 and remains above the baseline through 2022.4
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]
Alternatively, the further tightening of resource utilization in the baseline could
cause inflation to rise much faster than projected. Some research suggests that the
relationship between labor utilization and wage growth may become stronger—the
4 The Phillips curve in this model is very flat, so it may seem surprising that inflation falls
noticeably despite only a modest increase in the unemployment rate. That outcome arises because price
setters in the model are very forward looking, and the downward deviation of production costs from the
baseline—while small—is very persistent.

Inflation reaches 3 percent by the end of 2020, compared with about 2 percent in
the baseline. In response to the higher path of inflation, the federal funds rate rises more
and peaks slightly above 6 percent in 2022. As a result, real GDP rises a bit more slowly
and the unemployment rate is about ½ percentage point above the baseline by the end of
2023 (though still slightly below the level of the natural rate).
Global Market Correction [SIGMA]
Asset valuation pressures in the United States and in many foreign economies
remain noticeably elevated, with equity price-to-earnings ratios high by historical
standards, interest rate spreads on corporate debt narrow, and term premiums on
sovereign debt unusually compressed. In this scenario, we assume that investors become
very concerned about stretched valuations, and a widespread market correction ensues
over the course of 2018. Specifically, equity prices fall 20 percent and corporate
borrowing spreads increase 45 basis points in both the United States and abroad. While
term premiums on foreign sovereign bonds increase 30 basis points, term premiums on
U.S. Treasury securities rise only about half as much as investors rebalance their
portfolios toward dollar-denominated assets; these flight-to-safety flows cause the broad
real dollar to appreciate about 5 percent. The fall in global asset prices weakens
household and corporate balance sheets and weighs on confidence.
5 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth and slack, see, for example,
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet? Assessing Progress toward Full
Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vol. 9 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas, October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf; and Jeremy
Nalewaik (2016), “Non-Linear Phillips Curves with Inflation Regime-Switching,” Finance and Economics
Discussion Series 2016-078 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),
http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.078.
6 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the
current version of the FRB/US model. The magnitude of these increases reflects a comparison between
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

activity and inflation in the current scenario are lower than in the domestic “Market
Correction” scenario featured in the December Tealbook because of the adverse effects
stemming from weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy [SIGMA]
Our baseline forecast incorporates a slow policy normalization abroad as central
banks continue to face muted inflationary pressures. However, foreign economic growth,
especially in the AFEs, has been stronger than expected in recent quarters, and recent
communication by some AFE central banks has pointed to a less accommodative policy
stance. This scenario assumes that foreign GDP growth runs at an average pace of
3½ percent per year in 2018 and 2019, about ¾ percentage point above the baseline.
These improved macroeconomic conditions lead AFE central banks to fear they are
“behind the curve” and prompt them to tighten their policy rates more aggressively than
what is prescribed by the baseline policy rule. Higher interest rates abroad —including
from a rise in term premiums—along with some reversal of earlier flight-to-safety flows
into U.S. assets contribute to a 5 percent depreciation of the broad real dollar.
Despite the tightening of monetary policy abroad and some spillovers of that
tightening into U.S. interest rates, U.S. activity benefits as stronger foreign growth and
the weaker dollar boost net exports. U.S. real GDP expands 3¼ percent in 2018 and
2½ percent in 2019, about ¼ percentage point more than in the baseline. The
unemployment rate falls to just under 3 percent by the end of 2019. Higher import prices
and stronger economic activity cause core PCE price inflation to run ¼ percentage point
above the baseline in 2018 and 2019. The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in
the baseline, increasing to 5 percent by the end of 2020.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals Ri s
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y
t intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. As discussed in the Domestic Economic
Developments and Outlook section of Tealbook A, the output gap is considerably wider
in the staff’s medium-term projection than in the December Tealbook. Reflecting the
staff’s revised projection for the output gap, the paths for the federal funds rate prescribed
by simple rules and optimal control policies are noticeably higher than in December. A
special exhibit reports the changes from the previous Tealbook in prescriptions of simple
rules and optimal control policies as well as in their associated macroeconomic outcomes.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also
known as the “balanced approach” rule), a first-difference rule, and a nominal income
targeting (NIT) rule. These near-term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown in the middle panels. The top
and middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which
is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1
• The prescriptions of all of the simple policy rules are somewhat higher than in
the previous Tealbook, reflecting the upward revision to the staff’s near-term
forecast for the output gap.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.
• The prescriptions of the first-difference rule are modestly higher in the near
term than those in the Tealbook baseline.
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Except for the
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that
are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the September 2017 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r*. The previous−Tealbook r* is adjusted to be consistent with a
revision in the model's fiscal rules.

• Under the NIT rule, the federal funds rate responds to the current output gap
and the shortfall of the level of the GDP price deflator from the path it would
have attained had it increased at an annual rate of 2 percent since 2011:Q4; the
current shortfall in the GDP price deflator is about 4 percent. Unlike the other
rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call for raising the federal funds
rate in the near term, the NIT rule prescribes a level for the federal funds rate
in this quarter and the next that is near the low end of the current target range
to help eliminate the shortfall in the GDP price deflator.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS
RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the December 2017 Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP).2 Both estimates use the FRB/US model to conduct the
simulations. This concept, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (starting in the current
quarter), would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. This
concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy;
consequently, it is based on a single criterion and does not take into account other
considerations, such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the
federal funds rate.
• At 3.43 percent, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* in this
quarter is about 1 percentage point above the corresponding value in the
December Tealbook. The estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* has not
been revised up so sharply since 2010 and has not been above 3 percent since
2007. The large upward revision reflects the fact that the medium-term output
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the December 2017 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a
smooth and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered
in the SEP. For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

gap in the current staff forecast is notably wider than in the December
Tealbook.3
• At 1.09 percent, the SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The difference stems from the fact that the
SEP-consistent projection, based on information available at the time of the
December meeting, has output exceeding potential by a considerably smaller
amount from 2018 through 2020 than does the current Tealbook forecast
despite the lower median path for the real federal funds rate in the SEP.

participants, price setters, and wage setters believe that monetary policy will follow
through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the
macroeconomy of such a policy.5 The exhibit also reports the Tealbook baseline
projection.
• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, the federal funds rate increases, on
average, about 1.2 percentage points per year through 2020. The federal
funds rate peaks at 5 percent in 2021 before slowly moving down to its
longer-run level, which the staff assumes will be 2½ percent.
3 In the previous Tealbook, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* for the current quarter
was 17 basis points higher than for the previous quarter, reflecting the continued strengthening of the
economy already embedded in the December Tealbook baseline.
4 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in
the top panel of the first exhibit.
5 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly
understands the implications of the FOMC adopting a particular policy strategy. In the real world, the
adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a period during which the public
learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications. We abstract from considerations of this kind.

• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values exceed the corresponding
Tealbook baseline values by about 1.4 percentage points per year, on average,
over the next three years. These relatively high values for the federal funds
rate are followed by slightly lower values than in the Tealbook baseline
beyond 2022. The unemployment rate under the Taylor (1999) rule runs
somewhat higher than the Tealbook baseline through 2021; the unemployment
rate runs lower than in the baseline starting in 2022. Inflation under the
Taylor (1999) rule runs a bit above its baseline path over the period shown in
the figures. The reason that the sharp increase in the federal funds rate under
the Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy
is because agents in the model are forward looking and thus correctly
anticipate that the federal funds rate beyond the medium term will be lower
than under the Tealbook baseline; the result is a path for the 10-year real
Treasury yield that runs below that in the baseline over the majority of the
next decade, thereby supporting economic activity and inflation.6
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate. The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than
the Tealbook baseline over the next two years, though they are lower than
those of the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown because the Taylor
(1993) rule responds less strongly to the projected excess in output over its
assumed potential level. Accordingly, inflation under the Taylor (1993) rule
exceeds inflation under the Tealbook baseline by more than under the Taylor
(1999) rule, whereas the unemployment rate falls below the path in the
Tealbook baseline sooner.
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first-difference rule is
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline over the next three years
but runs below the baseline path for some years thereafter. The latter
divergence occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the
6 In the FRB/US model, inflation tends to respond more strongly than the unemployment rate to
longer-run developments. In the case of the Taylor (1999) rule, beyond 2022 the rule prescribes a path of
the federal funds rate that runs, for a time, lower than the Tealbook baseline path. As a result, there is a
long period during which the 10-year real Treasury yield under the Taylor (1999) rule is relatively low.
Because agents in the model anticipate this period of low real 10-year Treasury rates, inflation under the
Taylor (1999) rule exceeds inflation in the Tealbook baseline.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the
projected narrowing of the output gap beyond the next three years. The
associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction with
expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer-term real
interest rates than in the Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of
resource utilization and inflation. Thus, the first-difference rule generates
outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower, and outcomes for
inflation that are higher, than the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook
baseline projection.
• The NIT rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as
measured by the rate of increase in the GDP price deflator) from an annual
rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011. Compared with the Tealbook baseline
policy, the NIT rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the
federal funds rate because the cumulative shortfall of inflation from 2 percent
since the end of 2011 is currently large, at about 4 percent. Because the
simulation embeds the assumption that policymakers can credibly commit to
closing this gap and that financial market participants and price and wage
setters correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates,
the path of the real 10-year Treasury rate is lower than under the other policy
rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years. Accordingly, the path for
the unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline
and all other simulations shown, dropping to about 2.6 percent in 2021.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.8
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
8 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from the perspective

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

Three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for the
federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection. High levels of the real
federal funds rate are necessary in order to return the unemployment rate to its natural
rate relatively quickly because, in the FRB/US model, the unemployment rate does not
respond strongly to changes in real interest rates, a feature that appears to be consistent
with recent historical experience. However, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal
funds rate quickly to the high levels prescribed by most optimal control policies,
macroeconomic outcomes may well be appreciably different than the benign outcomes
predicted by the FRB/US model. The simulation results hinge on the assumptions that
agents in the model have perfect foresight and that the public believes with certainty that
policymakers will implement the path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the optimal
control exercises. While these assumptions may be a reasonable approximation under
some circumstances, they may not be valid for historically extreme changes in the federal
funds rate, particularly those prescribed by the optimal control exercise that places only a
minimal penalty on adjustments in the federal funds rate.
Nevertheless, the three optimal control policies that prescribe high paths for the
federal funds rate have prescribed tighter policy than the Tealbook baseline for several
years. Taken at face value, the additional economic strength embedded in the current
Tealbook baseline increases the motivation of policymakers to raise the federal funds rate
relatively quickly so as to keep the unemployment rate from falling further below its
natural rate.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path because, in the baseline projection, the
unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate
over the next several years—an outcome that policymakers with the equal
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

weights cost function judge to be costly.9 The tighter policy results in a path
for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of
the natural rate and a path for headline PCE inflation that is somewhat lower
than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with
the limited response of inflation to the level of resource utilization in the
FRB/US model.
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function

of unemployment. Because the public believes that policymakers will follow
through on this policy rate path even as the unemployment rate substantially
undershoots its natural rate, the tighter labor market brings inflation to
2 percent more quickly than in the case of equal weights. Starting in the
middle of the next decade (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a little
above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the
inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated
resource utilization.
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical to that specification. The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly
more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming
years. The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an

under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks below 5 percent, compared with nearly
8 percent under the Tealbook baseline.

unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds only weakly to resource
utilization. Hence, to raise inflation in the near term by even a small amount,
policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershoot by the
unemployment rate of its natural rate—an outcome that this specification of
the loss function also regards as costly.
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate soars to near 11 percent in
2018 and then settles between 7 and 9 percent over much of the remainder of
the period shown. This sharp tightening of policy reflects an effort to forestall
the projected undershoot by the unemployment rate of its natural rate in the
Tealbook baseline. The paths for the real federal funds rate and the real
10-year Treasury yield are also notably higher for a couple of years than in the
case of equal weights. Because the short-run Phillips curve is quite flat in the
FRB/US model and agents in the model take the 2 percent inflation objective
to be credible, this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to that in the
equal-weights case over the period shown, even though, in the period through
2020, this policy keeps the unemployment rate much closer to the staff’s
estimate of the natural rate.10
CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTIONS AND OUTCOMES FROM THE DECEMBER
TEALBOOK
The stronger economic outlook embedded in the staff’s baseline forecast implies
large upward revisions to the paths for the federal funds rate prescribed by simple policy
rules and the optimal control policies. Changes from the December Tealbook in the
federal funds rate prescriptions as well as in the unemployment rate and inflation
outcomes are shown in the fourth exhibit. The three panels to the left show these changes
under the simple policy rules, whereas the panels to the right show these changes under
the optimal control policies.
• The simple policy rules now prescribe levels for the federal funds rate that are,
on average over the projection period shown, between ½ and 1 percentage
10 From 2020 onward, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes
above and sometimes below the corresponding values observed in the case of equal weights.

point higher than in December. Despite the higher levels of the federal funds
rate, the unemployment rate falls by more than in the December Tealbook
because of the strength of the economic outlook embedded in the current
Tealbook baseline. Because the short-run Phillips curve is quite flat in the
FRB/US model, inflation outcomes are similar to those in the December
Tealbook.
• With the exception of the policy associated with the asymmetric weight on
ugap, the optimal control policies prescribe average levels for the federal
funds rate over the projection period shown that are between 1 and
1½ percentage points higher than in December. The tighter policy rates under
these policies offset most of the additional strength of the economic outlook
embedded in the current Tealbook baseline and imply little change in the path
for the unemployment rate or inflation from December. The optimal control
policy associated with an asymmetric weight on ugap does not penalize
deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate and, as a result,
responds only modestly to the additional strength embedded in the staff
outlook. The unemployment rate under this policy falls further, by about
0.4 percentage point, on average, over the projection period shown, and the
path for inflation is little changed from the December Tealbook.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined
as the difference between nominal income, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of the

inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and chosen

minal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.

do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the
equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to
inflation gaps. The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5 The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
