Monetary Policy Alternatives
Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that the economy has
continued to expand at a faster-than-potential pace and that the labor market has
continued to strengthen. The average pace of job gains in recent months has been
stronger than earlier last year and the unemployment rate has remained quite low. A
number of other measures of labor market conditions also point to high and rising levels
of labor utilization. Recent spending indicators, on balance, point to a moderation in real
GDP growth in the current quarter. This moderation appears likely to be temporary, for
two reasons. First, ongoing strengthening in the labor market, which is continuing to
bolster income and confidence, as well as stronger expansions abroad and
accommodative financial conditions, continue to support growth in consumer spending,
business investment, and exports. Second, the increased federal government spending
that will result from last month’s passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 is
expected to provide an additional boost to aggregate demand going forward. Inflation
has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, but recent monthly
readings are consistent with the staff’s expectation that inflation will step up in coming
months and run close to 2 percent this year.
There are two key questions for the Committee at this meeting: first, whether the
available information warrants raising the federal funds rate; and second, whether the
economic outlook and associated risks indicate that the federal funds rate path suggested
by recent FOMC statements remains appropriate. Against this background, three
alternative draft statements are given below for the Committee’s consideration. The
alternative policy statements differ in the views expressed about tightening resource
utilization and its implication for the inflation outlook and, hence, for the appropriate
message to convey about the federal funds rate path expected to be necessary to achieve
the Committee’s objectives.
Alternative B notes a stronger economic outlook but signals that this upgrade has
not substantially changed the Committee’s judgement about the pace of rate hikes that
will most likely prove appropriate. Alternative B includes a 25-basis-point increase in
the target range for the federal funds rate in March but leaves the guidance about the
future course of policy unchanged from the January statement.

Alternative C also acknowledges a stronger economic outlook but, unlike
Alternative B, is predicated on the view that allowing resource utilization to tighten much
further would create too large a risk that monetary policy will eventually need to tighten
abruptly. Consequently, Alternative C conveys the Committee’s intention to continue
gradually increasing the federal funds rate until it is high enough to slow growth in
employment and economic activity to sustainable rates.
In contrast, Alternative A is motivated by the view that longer-run inflation
expectations may be too low. It thus indicates that “A temporary period of inflation
modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee’s symmetric inflation
objective and may be needed to ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are
consistent with that objective.”
With regard to the specifics of the draft statement language:
 The three Alternatives agree in their assessment of the state of the labor market but
differ slightly in the assessment of the strength of incoming spending data.
o Each of the Alternatives recognizes that the labor market has continued to
strengthen and characterizes job gains as being “strong in recent months.”
o The Alternatives differ in their characterization of consumer spending and
business investment. Alternative A simply states that “Household spending
and business fixed investment appear to be expanding at a moderate pace.”
Alternative B notes that the moderation follows strong growth in the fourth
quarter. Alternative C states that “Household spending and business fixed
investment have been growing at solid rates, on average, in recent quarters.”
o Consistent with the recent spending indicators, Alternative B notes that
growth in economic activity has been “moderate” while Alternative A states
that it has “moderated.” Alternative C retains the language from January and
characterizes economic activity as “rising at a solid rate.”
 Regarding recent inflation developments, all three Alternatives note that inflation
continued to run below 2 percent, with Alternative C adding that both overall
inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have “increased from their
lows last summer.”
 The three Alternatives indicate that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations “are little changed, on balance,” as in the January statement, but differ
sevitanretlA

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) March 15, 2018

--- Page 6 ---

slightly in the language concerning market-based measures of inflation compensation.
Alternative B retains the language from January, Alternative C strikes the words “but
remain low,” and Alternative A instead deletes the language indicating that these
measures “have increased in recent months.”
 The outlook for economic activity and the labor market is somewhat different across
the three alternatives, as is the inflation outlook. In addition, the outlook associated
with each alternative is conditioned on a different expectation for monetary policy,
reflecting different views about the risks associated with reducing policy
accommodation at the pace currently anticipated by market participants.
o Alternatives B and C include a new sentence, “The economic outlook has
strengthened in recent months.” This sentence is meant to capture the various
factors that have contributed to a stronger outlook, including changes in fiscal
policy, stronger and more synchronous growth abroad, and financial
conditions that remain highly supportive of growth despite recent market
volatility. Moreover, the outlook paragraph in Alternative C signals more
strongly that the Committee sees further increases in the federal funds rate as
necessary to achieve sustainable growth rates of economic activity and
employment.
o Regarding the outlook for inflation, Alternative B now states that inflation is
expected to move up “in coming months” rather than “this year.” (The latter
words were used in the January statement.) This modification is not meant to
signal a change in the inflation outlook but rather to acknowledge that the
time when inflation is expected to step up closer to 2 percent is drawing near.
Alternative C also notes that inflation is expected to move up “in coming
months” but then conveys that, once the increase occurs, the Committee will
essentially have achieved its inflation objective. In contrast, Alternative A
signals a greater intention to achieve higher inflation by conditioning the
outlook on “appropriate monetary policy accommodation” and noting that “A
temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent … may be needed to
ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with” the
Committee’s objective.
o The three Alternatives retain the view that “Near-term risks to the economic
outlook appear roughly balanced.” Alternatives A and B, but not C, keep the
statement that “the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.”

 With respect to the current policy decision:
o Alternatives B and C raise the target range to 1½ to 1¾ percent and continue
to note that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.
o Alternative A leaves the target range at 1¼ to 1½ percent.
 With respect to the outlook for monetary policy:
o Alternative B makes no changes from the January statement.
o Alternative C drops the statement that “the federal funds rate is likely to
remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer
run,” thus suggesting that the federal funds rate may need to rise to its normal
longer-run level faster than otherwise.
o Alternative A drops all of the guidance about the path of the federal funds
rate, thus conveying a more agnostic view of how policy will need to evolve
in order to achieve the Committee’s objectives.

JANUARY 2018 FOMC STATEMENT
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic
activity has been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending,
and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has
stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items
other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain
low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little
changed, on balance.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a
moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a
12‐month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the
economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring
inflation developments closely.
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4
to 1‐1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent
inflation.
4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic
conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent
inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,
including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures
and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international
developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to
remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.
However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic
outlook as informed by incoming data.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR MARCH 2018
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December
January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen remained
strong and that while growth in economic activity has been rising at a solid rate
moderated. Job gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed
investment have been solid strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate
has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment appear to
be expanding at a moderate pace. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation
and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2
percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in
recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations are little changed, on balance.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual
adjustments in the stance of appropriate monetary policy accommodation,
economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions
will remain strong. Inflation on a 12‐month basis is expected to move up this year
and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium
term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the
Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4
to 1‐1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent
inflation. A temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be
consistent with the Committee’s symmetric inflation objective and may be
needed to ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with
that objective.
4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic
conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent
inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,

ALTERNATIVE B FOR MARCH 2018
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December
January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that
economic activity has been rising at a solid moderate rate. Job gains in
employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid
strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent
data suggest that growth of household spending and business fixed
investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter rates. On a 12-
month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and
energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of
inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on
balance.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in
recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in

a 12‐month basis is expected to move up this year in coming months and to
stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the

3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the
Committee decided to maintain raise the target range for the federal funds rate at
1-1/4 to 1‐1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains
accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a
sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

ALTERNATIVE C FOR MARCH 2018
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December
January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that
economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains in employment,
household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid strong in
recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household
spending and business fixed investment have been growing at solid rates, on
average, in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and
inflation for items other than food and energy have increased from their lows
last summer but have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures
of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low;
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on

2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in
recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in
the stance of monetary policy, economic activity and employment will expand at
a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong sustainable rates
in the medium term. Inflation on a 12‐month basis is expected to move up this
year in coming months and then to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent
objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Available data indicate that the labor market has continued to strengthen but does not
yet appear to be overheating.
o Over the past three months, payrolls have increased by an average of 242,000
per month, well above the pace estimated to be consistent with an unchanged
unemployment rate if the labor force participation rate declines in line with its
estimated trend path.
o The unemployment rate in February was 4.1 percent for the fifth consecutive
month, below all FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate
of unemployment in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).
o The labor force participation rate jumped 0.3 percentage point to 63.0 percent
in February. While the staff projects this increase to be reversed by year end,
the labor force participation rate is projected to continue to run above its
estimated trend level.
o Notwithstanding the strong pace of job gains, the low unemployment rate, and
the increase in labor force participation, compensation data continued to point
to moderate wage growth.
 Although inflation on a 12-month basis remains below the Committee’s 2 percent
objective, the past several monthly readings have corroborated the view that inflation
is moving up gradually.
o Over the 12 months ending in January, the core PCE inflation rate was
1.5 percent, up about ¼ percentage point from its low last summer. In coming
months, when the extraordinarily low reading from last March drops out of
the calculation of 12-month inflation, core PCE inflation is quite likely to
move up closer to 2 percent. Thereafter, with resource utilization tightening
substantially further in the staff’s projection, core inflation rises from
1.9 percent this year to 2.2 percent in 2020.
o Over the 12 months ending in January, total PCE inflation was 1.7 percent.
Total PCE inflation is projected to climb to 1.8 percent this year and to reach
2.1 percent in 2020.
o On balance, longer-term survey-based measures of inflation expectations and
market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved little since
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) March 15, 2018
Page 9 of 36

--- Page 13 ---

January. Median 10-year inflation expectations for PCE prices in the Survey
of Professional Forecasters held steady at 2.0 percent in the first quarter, the
median of expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey
was stable at 2.5 percent in February, and the 3-year-ahead measure of median
inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of
Consumer Expectations edged up to 2.9 percent in February, reversing the
previous month’s decline and remaining within the narrow range observed
since last summer. The TIPS-based measure of 5-to-10-year-forward inflation
compensation changed little over the latest intermeeting period but is up about
15 basis points since the December FOMC meeting and 25 basis points since
the November FOMC meeting.
 Real GDP is now estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year and is projected to increase 2.1 percent in the first quarter
of this year but then to pick up, bringing about a further widening of the gap between
actual and potential output. Despite somewhat softer readings on consumer spending,
fundamentals underpinning consumer demand remain sound; most importantly, the
ongoing strengthening in the labor market is continuing to bolster income and
confidence. Moreover, the recently enacted tax bill should boost spending. The staff
projects that the overall effect of the tax cuts enacted in December and the spending
increases authorized in February will be to raise the growth rate of real GDP by
½ percentage point in 2018, ¾ percentage point in 2019, and ½ percentage point in
2020.
 Real GDP in the foreign economies averaged a solid 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
More recent foreign economic data point to an upbeat start to this year, and the staff
sees foreign growth picking up to 3 percent this quarter.
Policy Strategy
 The rates of output growth in the current quarter and the fourth quarter of last year—
while lower than expected in the January Tealbook—nonetheless imply a further
widening of the gap between actual and potential output. This development, together
with the projected pick-up in the pace of growth in real activity after the current
quarter, may have bolstered policymakers’ confidence that inflation will reach 2
percent this year. That being so, they may see it as appropriate to continue the
gradual removal of policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal
funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent at this meeting and to continue to signal that further
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) March 15, 2018
Page 10 of 36

--- Page 14 ---

gradual rate hikes are likely appropriate to achieve maximum employment and a
sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
 With the recent fiscal policy actions expected to provide significant stimulus to
growth, financial conditions still supportive of growth (notwithstanding recent
volatility in financial markets), and solid growth abroad, policymakers may wish to
upgrade their assessment of the economic outlook by adding a sentence indicating
that “The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.”
 Nonetheless, with an increase in the target range at this meeting and further gradual
increases in the federal funds rate projected, policymakers may continue to perceive
the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.
 As shown in the “Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty” box, financial
market quotes indicate that market participants are nearly certain that the Committee
will raise the target range by 25 basis points at this meeting, an assessment shared by
respondents to the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants.
Looking ahead, federal funds futures quotes imply that the modal outlook of market
participants envisions a total increase of about 75 basis points by the end of this year.
The median of the modal responses to the Desk’s surveys points to four 25-basis-
points rate hikes this year, but respondents see the likelihood of four hikes as only
slightly higher than the probability of three. In light of current market expectations, a
statement along the lines of Alternative B seems unlikely, by itself, to generate an
appreciable change in asset prices, though the indication that the outlook has
strengthened could lead to some steepening of the expected path for the federal funds
rate.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is already appreciably beyond full
employment and that economic activity—which was already growing at a faster-than-
sustainable rate—will be further spurred by the recently enacted tax cuts and
spending legislation.
o The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in February, well below each FOMC
participant’s estimate of its longer-run normal level in the December SEP.
o Despite four increases in the target range for the federal funds rate from
December 2016 to January 2018, the average pace of payroll gains in 2017

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty
Futures markets have almost fully priced in a 25‐basis‐point increase in the target
range for the federal funds rate at the FOMC’s upcoming March meeting, and the
average odds assigned to this outcome by respondents to the Desk’s surveys of
primary dealers and market participants are comparably high. Expectations for
the path of the federal funds rate based on market and survey measures have
also ticked up, on balance.
Figure 1 shows the probability distribution, derived from quotes on federal funds
futures contracts, of the total number of 25‐basis‐point rate increases over the
next three FOMC meetings (March, May, and June). The probability that there
will be two rate hikes has increased by about 10 percentage points over the
intermeeting period, to around 70 percent. The probability of only one rate hike
over these three meetings has come down by a similar amount.
Looking ahead to the end of 2018, the probability distribution for the level of the
federal funds rate, based on options quotes and assuming zero term premiums,
has shifted only marginally to the right (figure 2). It continues to suggest that
investors place the greatest odds on the federal funds rate falling into the 2 to 2¼
percent range—consistent with three 25‐basis‐point increases in the target range
in 2018. Figure 3 shows the corresponding average probability distribution from
the Desk’s surveys; respondents to those surveys see increased odds of higher
rate outcomes relative to the January survey. Survey respondents now place
almost the same probability on four 25‐basis‐point rate increases this year as on
three such rate hikes. In addition, the survey‐based distribution now assigns
roughly the same likelihood as the probability distribution from market quotes to
end‐of‐year federal funds rate levels suggestive of four or more rate hikes this
year—about 35 percent.
Figure 4 shows how different measures of federal funds rate expectations for the
end of 2018 have evolved since June 2016. The figure displays market‐based
metrics (with and without term premium adjustments) derived from quotes on
overnight index swap contracts (OIS), the median projection from FOMC
participants’ Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) through December 2017,
and the median of respondents’ modal forecasts as well as the average of
respondents’ implied mean forecasts from the Desk surveys. Of note, the latter
two forecasts approximately correspond to the mode and mean, respectively, of
the distribution shown in figure 3. All measures declined somewhat around the
U.K.’s referendum on “Brexit” and subsequently rose notably in the wake of the
U.S. presidential election. The SEP (the golden squares) and Desk survey modal
forecasts (the black dots) remained stable at 2 to 2¼ percent from early 2017 to
January 2018, whereas the market‐based measures (the red and blue lines) and
the Desk survey implied mean forecasts (the grey dots) trended down from
March to September 2017 and have inched up steadily since then. The narrowing
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) March 15, 2018
Page 12 of 36

--- Page 16 ---

of the gap between the forward rates implied by OIS quotes (the blue line) and
the expected path of the federal funds rate with adjustments for term premiums
as estimated by a staff term structure model (the red line) reflects, in part, the
shrinkage of negative term premiums toward zero as the projection horizon
nears, and possibly also the diminution of downside risks as interest rates move
further away from the lower bound. Based on the most recent observations, the
unadjusted market‐implied measure, the December SEP median, and the Desk
survey’s implied mean forecast are consistent with three 25‐basis‐point rate
increases in 2018, while the market measure that adjusts for term premiums and
the Desk survey’s latest modal forecast both reflect an expectation of four hikes.
Figure 5 shows market‐implied measures of the expected federal funds rate path
beyond 2018. The path derived from quotes on OIS and not adjusted for term
premiums (the blue line) has shifted up modestly over the intermeeting period,
mostly in 2019 and 2020. The staff’s term structure model attributes much of this
increase to higher (less negative) term premiums, leaving the term‐premium‐
adjusted path (the red line) only a touch higher.
Expectations for the path of the federal funds rate have likely been buoyed, in
part, by the prospective economic effects of additional government spending
resulting from the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In the March
Desk surveys, participants further marked up their projections for the U.S. fiscal
deficit in coming years. As shown by the two sets of bars to the left in figure 6,
since the December survey, the median projection for the budget deficit in the
Survey of Primary Dealers, as a percentage of GDP, has increased by roughly
½ percentage point for 2018 and 1¼ percentage points for 2019. The deficit for
2020 (not shown) is projected to remain at approximately its 2019 level. The bars
to the right of the figure show that, over the same period, the median projection
for real GDP growth has shifted up for 2018 and 2019 by 40 and 20 basis points,
respectively. The median growth estimate for 2020 was little changed at 1.8
percent, in line with participants’ longer‐run estimate for GDP growth (not
shown).1

Participants does not ask respondents for GDP growth forecasts.

and early 2018 significantly exceeded the pace necessary to absorb new
entrants (and reentrants) into the labor force and to maintain a constant
unemployment rate over the longer run. Moreover, the recent acceleration in
payrolls may be seen as a signal that, given accommodative financial
conditions, monetary policy will need to tighten more than market participants
currently anticipate if the Committee is to succeed in slowing economic
growth to a sustainable pace.
o The staff forecasts that, from 2018 through 2020, average payroll gains will
continue to run above their longer-run sustainable pace. Accordingly, the
unemployment rate is projected to continue to decline, reaching 3.1 percent at
the end of 2019 and moving sideways throughout 2020. Such a low rate of
unemployment has not been reached in the United States for more than half a
century.
o Other indicators pointing to an already tight labor market include an elevated
rate of job openings, survey measures showing a high level of job availability,
widespread reports of firms having difficulty hiring workers, and near-record-
low initial claims for unemployment insurance.
 Policymakers may project that inflation will soon move above the Committee’s
2 percent objective. Twelve-month rates of total and core PCE inflation have been
held down by an unusually large decline in the price of cell phone services in March
2017. As this reading drops out of the 12-month calculation, inflation should move
closer to the target. Beyond the near term, the staff projects that core PCE price
inflation will move up to 2.2 percent and total PCE price inflation to 2.1 percent,
respectively, in 2020, conditional on a rising path for the federal funds rate.
Policymakers may believe that more concerted upward pressures on both wages and
prices are likely to emerge following a prolonged period of labor market tightness.
 Despite the four increases in the target range for the federal funds rate implemented
by the Committee between December 2016 and January 2018, financial conditions
appear to remain highly supportive of growth. The stock market experienced
considerable volatility and a decline in equity price indexes early in the intermeeting
period, but those indexes have since mostly recovered their losses. Spreads on
investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity
Treasury securities widened moderately but remained near the lower end of their
historical ranges.

 Policymakers may judge that the economic outlook has strengthened in recent
months.
o Indicators of consumer and business sentiment—including as measured by the
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the ISM manufacturing index,
and the Philadelphia Fed and Empire State future capital spending indexes—
have been buoyant.
o Foreign economic data released since the January FOMC meeting point to an
upbeat start to this year, and the staff sees foreign growth picking up to 3
percent this quarter. Despite volatility in financial markets abroad, overall
financial conditions continue to be supportive of foreign growth.
o Recent tax cuts and spending legislation will provide significant stimulus to
growth. The staff projects that the level of real GDP will be about 3½ percent
above potential GDP by the end of 2020, about ¼ percentage point higher
than in the January Tealbook.
Policy Strategy
 Despite past rate increases and a sequence of FOMC statements noting an expectation
of further gradual hikes, employment and economic activity continue to expand more
rapidly than is sustainable in the longer run. Consequently, policymakers may be
concerned that market participants expect too small a cumulative increase in the
federal funds rate, which would in turn risk significant overheating, inflation well
above target, and eventually a need to tighten policy abruptly.
 Policymakers might be concerned that significant undershooting of the longer-run
normal rate of unemployment, alongside accommodative financial conditions, could
lead to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities. For example, in addition to already
elevated asset valuations rising further, policymakers may also see the historically
high levels of leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector, and the accompanying
danger that interest-expense ratios could rise rapidly if monetary policy needed to be
tightened quickly, as a vulnerability.
 For all of the above reasons, policymakers may opt not only to raise the target range
of the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent but also to highlight that the Committee
anticipates tightening policy enough to slow growth of output and employment to
sustainable rates in coming years.

--- Page 20 ---

 A statement like Alternative C could surprise market participants, particularly if read
as indicating an intention to raise the federal funds rate enough to slow growth to a
sustainable pace fairly soon. If the public were to infer that the current Committee
has a less accommodative “reaction function” than last year’s Committee, then
medium- and longer-term real interest rates would likely rise, as would the exchange
value of the dollar, and equity prices and inflation compensation would probably fall.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 On a 12-month basis, core inflation has continued to run notably below 2 percent.
Twelve-month core PCE inflation including only market-based prices was 1.1 percent
in January. Policymakers may judge that inflation this year has been held down, at
least in part, by persistent factors.
 One factor holding down both core and all-items inflation may be low expected
inflation. Readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation remain
substantially below where they were before the middle of 2014, and survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations also remain low by historical
standards.
 Moreover, the labor market may not yet have reached maximum sustainable
employment. The unemployment rate has declined about ¾ percentage point over the
past year, and average job gains have been solid; nonetheless, wages have shown
little sign of accelerating. The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers
has been rising but still remains below its pre-recession level, suggesting scope for
further labor market strengthening. In addition, the labor force participation rate
jumped 0.3 percentage point to 63.0 percent in February. The behavior of labor force
participation rate over the past four years suggests that its trend may well be higher
than previously estimated.
Policy Strategy
 Policymakers may be concerned that longer-term inflation expectations have declined
materially in recent years and could drift down further if inflation continues to run
below 2 percent. Policymakers may further judge that raising the federal funds rate
while inflation is below 2 percent runs the risk of creating the perception that the
Committee sees its longer-run objective as a ceiling rather than as a symmetric
objective.
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) March 15, 2018
Page 17 of 36

--- Page 21 ---

o In order to solidify the Committee’s commitment to its inflation objective and
to prevent further erosion in inflation expectations, policymakers may favor a
statement like Alternative A and the addition of the sentence “A temporary
period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the
Committee’s symmetric inflation objective and may be needed to ensure that
longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with that objective.”
 Policymakers may view the current state of the financial system as sound and see the
potential for a buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, partly reflecting a
judgment that the banking system is well capitalized and that broad measures of
leverage and credit growth remain contained. In addition, policymakers may see
scope to address any emerging financial stability concerns through macroprudential
policies and supervisory actions that target specific risks.
 Despite the likely stimulative effects of the recently enacted changes in federal taxes
and spending, other policies could pose downside risk. Policymakers may judge that
their ability to react to downside outcomes is limited by proximity to the effective
lower bound.
 On the basis of these arguments, policymakers may want to communicate that an
increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is not warranted at this meeting
and that future increases are unlikely until a sustained return to the 2 percent inflation
objective has been achieved.
 Financial market quotes and the Desk’s latest surveys indicate that market
participants view an increase in the target range at the March meeting as a near
certainty. Thus, a statement along the lines of Alternative A would likely be regarded
as a significant change in the Committee’s policy outlook and bring down
expectations of further rate hikes. If the public saw this statement as primarily
reflecting policymakers’ resolve to push inflation up to or above 2 percent, then
inflation compensation could rise, real longer-term interest rates would probably fall
somewhat, and equity prices might rise. Lower real rates and the prospect of higher
inflation likely would encourage depreciation of the dollar. Conversely, if investors
read the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat assessment of the
economic outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation could fall.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range for the federal funds
rate, an implementation note that indicates no change to its administered rates—the
interest rates on required and excess reserves, the offering rate on overnight reverse
repurchase agreements, and the primary credit rate—would be issued. If the Committee
decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, an implementation note that
communicates the changes the Federal Reserve decided to make in these three policy
tools would be issued. Draft implementation notes that correspond to these two cases
appear on the following pages; struck-out text indicates language deleted from the

Balance Sheet and Income Projections
The staff has prepared projections of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and
elements of the associated income statement that are consistent with the baseline
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A. Relative to the January Tealbook, the
normalization of the size of the balance sheet occurs one quarter later, and the higher
interest rate paths in the latest staff economic forecast lead to a larger unrealized loss
position of the SOMA portfolio. Key features of these projections are described below.
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments. As reported in the exhibit titled
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the staff projects that
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017 will lead to the
redemption of $36 billion of Treasury securities and $24 billion of agency securities
during the current quarter. Over 2018 as a whole, holdings of Treasury and agency
securities are projected to decline by about $230 billion and $140 billion, respectively.
During this same period, about $200 billion of Treasury securities and about $60 billion
of agency securities will be reinvested.1 The projections for agency securities are
particularly uncertain because unscheduled prepayments depend on a number of factors
that are difficult to predict, including the realized path of mortgage rates.
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet. The size of the balance sheet is
projected to normalize in the third quarter of 2021, about one month later than in the
January Tealbook (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items”
and the table that follows the exhibit).2 The revision in the timing of normalization
reflects higher MBS holdings due to lower prepayments, as well as a slower pace of
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasury securities has been fully
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury securities will primarily take place in the
middle month of each quarter. In contrast, under the staff’s current baseline forecast of rising longer-term
interest rates, the maximum $20 billion cap on monthly redemptions of agency securities is not projected to
bind.
2 Many factors will influence the size at which the balance sheet will be normalized, including
banks’ post-crisis underlying demand for reserves. Generally speaking, the size of the balance sheet is
considered to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury securities is required in order to
maintain the desired longer-run level of reserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key
non-reserve liability items.

growth in Federal Reserve notes in the near term, two factors which imply higher reserve
balances of depository institutions throughout the projection period.3
From the start of the balance sheet normalization program in October 2017 to its
conclusion in 2021, the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings are projected to decline by
about $1.3 trillion, with holdings of Treasury and agency securities shrinking by about
$800 billion and $475 billion, respectively. At the time of normalization:
 Reserve balances reach the assumed longer-run level of $500 billion;4
 Total assets are projected to stand at roughly $3 trillion, with the SOMA portfolio
consisting of about $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities and $1.3 trillion in MBS.
Once these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the size of the balance
sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GDP, compared with a peak
of about 25 percent in late 2014 and a pre-crisis average of about 6 percent. After the
size of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will rise, keeping pace with the
projected increases in Federal Reserve liabilities including Federal Reserve notes in
circulation, the Treasury General Account (TGA), and Federal Reserve Bank capital.
However, when expressed as a share of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve assets and
liabilities are projected to edge down, as their pace of expansion is projected to be
slightly slower than that of current-dollar GDP.
Federal Reserve remittances. Remittances to the Treasury are projected to
decline to about $55 billion this year from $80 billion in 2017.5 This decline reflects both
the projected increases in the interest rate paid on reserve balances associated with future
increases in the target range for the federal funds rate (see the “Income Projections”
3 Other factors contributing to this outcome are a slight decrease in capital as a result of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, as well as a slight decrease in projected foreign repo pool balances.
4 Other noteworthy assumptions about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:
The Treasury General Account is assumed to increase in line with nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in
circulation are assumed to increase at an average annual pace of about 6 percent through 2020 and at the
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated
financial market utilities remain at their February 2018 levels of about $232 billion and $70 billion,
respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to maintain a value of $100 billion until
the level of reserve balances reaches $1 trillion, at which point take-up declines to zero over the course of
one year.

exhibit), and the $2.5 billion reduction in surplus.6 Total interest expense is projected to
rise to about $51 billion this year, while interest income from SOMA holdings is
expected to decline slightly to $110 billion. As the target range for the federal funds rate
moves up and the size of the SOMA portfolio decreases, remittances are expected to
bottom out at about $31 billion in 2020. Thereafter, remittances begin to increase,
particularly once the size of the balance sheet is normalized and higher-yielding Treasury
securities are being added to the SOMA portfolio.
Projected remittances over the next few years are similar to the January Tealbook
baseline. Subsequently, projected remittances are higher, largely due to the upward
revision to the projection of the interest rates the SOMA will receive on Treasury
securities purchased after normalization. As shown in the bottom left panel of the
“Income Projections” exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal
GDP over the projection period, slightly higher than the pre-crisis average.
Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a
net unrealized loss position of about $40 billion at the end of February. With longer-term
rates expected to continue to rise over the next several years, the unrealized loss position
is expected to reach nearly $300 billion in 2020:Q1. Of this amount, $120 billion is
attributable to Treasury securities and $180 billion to agency MBS. The unrealized loss
position subsequently narrows, in part because the value of securities acquired under the
Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs returns to par as those securities
approach maturity. Relative to the January Tealbook baseline, the net unrealized position
is projected to be, on average, about $40 billion more negative along the entire projection
horizon, with this revision due to higher trajectories of medium- and longer-term interest
rates.
6 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 basis-point-wide target range for the federal
funds rate for the duration of the projection, and that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances and
the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the top and bottom of the range, respectively.

Term premium effect. As shown in the table “Projections for the 10-Year
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result of the Federal
Reserve’s asset purchase programs are currently estimated to be reducing the term
premium in the 10-year Treasury yield by 86 basis points; this effect is projected to fade
gradually over time.7 This projection is little changed from the previous Tealbook.
SOMA characteristics. As shown in the top panel of the “Projections for the
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average
duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about six years. The weighted-
average duration of that portfolio is projected to increase throughout the process of
balance sheet normalization, as the pace of redemptions picks up and longer-duration
securities become a larger share of the portfolio.
After normalization of the size of the balance sheet in 2021, the duration of the
SOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to decline as the Federal Reserve resumes
purchases of Treasury securities. The initial sharp decline in duration results from the
staff’s assumption that these purchases will be limited to Treasury bills until they account
for one-third of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities portfolio, close to the pre-crisis
composition (currently the SOMA portfolio contains no Treasury bills). Thereafter,
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum
(see the bottom panel of the exhibit).
7 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the difference between the expected
path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years and a benchmark counterfactual projection
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In
particular, in the benchmark counterfactual balance sheet projection, the staff assumes a longer-run level of
reserves of $100 billion and a constant, minimal TGA level, consistent with the pre-crisis minimum level of
excess reserve balances and the Treasury’s pre-crisis cash management policy.
