Monetary Policy Alternatives
Information received since the Committee met in September indicates that the
labor market has continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling to
3.7 percent in September and payrolls continuing to expand strongly. Real GDP is
estimated to have grown by about 3 percent over the past four quarters. The staff projects
above-trend real GDP growth through 2019 and high levels of resource utilization over
the medium term. The 12-month changes in headline and core PCE prices were each
2 percent in September. The staff forecasts both headline and core PCE inflation to
remain close to 2 percent through 2021.
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presented below offer a
range of policy options and assessments about the outlook for policy. Alternative B is
based on the view that the economy has been evolving broadly in line with expectations
and, as a result, that the outlook for policy implied by recent FOMC communications
remains appropriate. Under this alternative, the Committee would maintain the target
range for the federal funds rate and reiterate the expectation that further gradual increases
in the target range will be consistent with achieving its goals.
Alternative C is written from the perspective that the incoming data continue to be
stronger than is sustainable and that, in order to contain eventual inflation risks, the
FOMC should signal that the federal funds rate will likely need to rise to a higher level
than has been implied by previous communications. Under this alternative, the
Committee would raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting and
signal that further gradual increases are likely to continue “for some time” in order to
contain inflation risks resulting from high levels of resource utilization. While the
Committee might judge that the adoption of Alternative C is not warranted at this
meeting, the statement could be viewed as a draft template for a contingency in which the
Committee becomes concerned about inflation rising appreciably above 2 percent.
Alternative A is motivated by the belief that the current stance of monetary policy
is appropriately at, or very close to, neutral—a state in which policy is neither
expansionary nor contractionary—and that further increases in the target range for the
federal funds rate at this stage could unduly slow the economic expansion and forestall
the sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Under this
sevitanretlA

alternative, the Committee would maintain the current target range for the federal funds
rate and would signal a pause in—or the end of—the current tightening cycle.
While the Committee might view the language in Alternative A as premature in
present circumstances, it might nonetheless consider such language for possible future
use once the Committee judges that further increases in the target range for the federal
funds rate are no longer warranted. In the period leading up to such a judgment, a
communications challenge is when and how to transition away from the guidance that the
FOMC expects “further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate.
As background, a box titled “The ‘Measured Pace’ Language and Subsequent
Communications” recounts the FOMC’s transition away from the “measured pace”
language in 2005 and 2006.
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A, B, and C:
 The assessment of the incoming data:
o Alternatives A and B have identical characterizations of the incoming data.
This characterization is similar to that in the September FOMC statement, but
notes that “growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid
pace earlier in the year” and also that the unemployment rate has “declined.”1
o Alternative C emphasizes that the labor market “continued to tighten,” citing
“robust” job gains and noting that “the unemployment rate has reached multi-
decade lows.” Like Alternatives A and B, Alternative C points out that
“growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace
earlier in the year.”
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation, the associated risks, and the
monetary policy path upon which the outlook is conditioned:
o Alternative B projects “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor
market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent
objective over the medium term,” and notes that risks to this outlook are
“roughly balanced.” These outcomes are achieved with “further gradual
increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate.
1 The language in the draft alternative statements related to the labor market may need to be
adjusted in light of the employment report for October, which is scheduled to be released on Friday,
November 2, 2018.
sevitanretlA

o Alternative C offers essentially the same outlook for economic activity, the
labor market, and inflation as Alternative B, but conditions this outlook on
“further gradual increases” continuing “for some time.” Alternative C states
that risks are “roughly balanced” only for the outlook for economic activity
and adds a cautionary note that “The Committee is monitoring inflation
developments closely.”
o Alternative A offers the same outlook for economic activity and inflation as
Alternative B. However, under Alternative A, the Committee no longer
conditions the economic outlook on “further gradual increases” in the target
range for the federal funds rate, and instead conveys the expectation that “the
current target range for the federal funds rate will, for a time, be consistent
with” sustained economic expansion and inflation near the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent objective.
 The current policy decision and the outlook for policy:
o Alternative B maintains the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to
2¼ percent. With the outlook conditioned on “further gradual increases” in
the target range for the federal funds rate, such a statement would signal little
change in the Committee’s outlook for policy.
o Alternative C raises the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to
2½ percent, and notes that “This decision should help guard against the risk
that excessive inflation pressures will emerge amid increasingly high levels of
resource utilization.”2 With “further gradual increases” in the target range for
the federal funds rate expected “for some time,” such a statement would signal
that the Committee judges that it will eventually need to raise the federal
funds rate to a higher level than has been implied by previous
communications.
o Alternative A maintains the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to
2¼ percent. By removing the reference to “further gradual increases” and
indicating that the target range for the federal funds rate is expected to stay at
its current level “for a time,” such a statement would signal that the
Committee judges the existing stance of policy to be close enough to neutral
2 The implementation note associated with Alternative C embeds the assumption that, along with
the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve would make a technical
realignment of the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances relative to the top of the target
range for the federal funds rate.

The “Measured Pace” Language and Subsequent Communications
A key communications challenge the FOMC is likely to face before too long is when and how
to transition away from guidance in the postmeeting statement that the Committee expects
“further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee
faced a similar decision in late 2005 and early 2006 as it transitioned away from guidance
characterizing the pace at which policy accommodation could be removed. This box reviews
the Committee’s discussions at FOMC meetings over the period that preceded the removal
of the “measured pace” language from the postmeeting statement and the later removal of
guidance regarding additional policy “firming.”
Between June 2004 and June 2006, the Committee raised the federal funds rate target at
17 consecutive meetings (figure 1). Beginning with the May 2004 FOMC postmeeting
statement, and in each postmeeting statement through November 2005, the Committee
communicated its judgment that “policy accommodation” could be “removed at a pace that
is likely to be measured.” In the latter half of 2005, the FOMC’s discussions about whether
to continue including the “measured pace” language in the postmeeting statement
intensified.
The discussions at the December 2005 FOMC meeting reveal that a number of participants
believed that the “measured pace” language had come to imply an increase in the federal
funds rate target by 25 basis points at the next meeting and had outlived its usefulness. Half
of respondents to the Desk’s December 2005 Survey of Primary Dealers expected the
“measured pace” language to be modified or removed. In the December 2005 postmeeting
statement, the Committee modified its usage of “measured,” and indicated that “some
further measured policy firming is likely to be needed.”1 Retaining the word was generally
seen as providing continuity with previous statements and indicating that the federal funds
rate target was unlikely to rise by more than 25 basis points at the next meeting. In January
2006, the Committee removed the word “measured” from the postmeeting statement
altogether.
Over the first half of 2006, FOMC meeting participants saw the policy outlook as becoming
less certain and increasingly dependent on incoming data. In the January 2006 and March
2006 postmeeting statements, the Committee no longer indicated that further increases in
the federal funds rate were “likely.” Instead, it provided guidance that “the Committee
judges that some further policy firming may be needed,” indicating less certainty that the
period of successive rate increases would continue. In May 2006, the FOMC further
modified the guidance to say that “some further policy firming may yet be needed,” and
emphasized that “the extent and timing of any such firming” would depend on economic
developments and the outlook. In their discussions at the June 2006 FOMC meeting,
participants expressed a range of views about the risks to the outlook, though all were
1 In the December 2005 postmeeting statement, the Committee also removed reference to the
stance of monetary policy being “accommodative.” This matter was discussed in the box titled “The
Removal of the ‘Remains Accommodative’ Language in 2005” in Tealbook B of July 2018.

concerned about elevated readings on core inflation. At that meeting, the FOMC decided to
raise the federal funds rate target and, reflecting the risk that inflation would not moderate,
to offer guidance that “the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed”
would depend on the incoming information.
Responses to the Desk’s dealer survey and contemporaneous media reports suggest that
FOMC communications in late 2005 and early 2006 were reasonably successful in aligning
the public’s interpretation of the transition away from the “measured pace” language with
the Committee’s intentions. Nearterm expectations for policy were mostly unchanged after
the usage of “measured” was modified in December 2005. Additionally, market
commentaries reported that the change in statement language in January 2006 that was
associated with the removal of the word “measured” underscored the fact that any future
increases in the federal funds rate would depend on incoming data.
In late 2006 and early 2007, as the FOMC kept the federal funds rate target unchanged at
5.25 percent, the Committee considered removing the “additional firming” language. The
March 2007 FOMC meeting transcript indicates two broad views among FOMC participants
with regard to removing this language. One view was that retaining the reference to
“additional firming” would lean against the perception that the Committee would be
satisfied with inflation continuing at its current level. The other view was that incoming data
on economic activity had been mixed, that inflation was projected to moderate, and that a
shift to “future policy adjustments” better reflected downside risks to economic activity that
had become more apparent. In the March 2007 postmeeting statement, the Committee
decided to drop its reference to “additional firming” and instead state that “future policy
adjustments” would depend on incoming data.

and that no further tightening is expected to be necessary, or that a meaningful
pause in raising rates is appropriate to guard against the risk of overtightening.
With no reference to the direction of future changes in the target range, such a
statement would also highlight the Committee’s continued guidance that “the
timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds
rate” will need to be evaluated in light of incoming information.

SEPTEMBER 2018 FOMC STATEMENT
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic
activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average,
in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household
spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy
remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little
changed, on balance.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual
increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium
term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the
Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4
percent.
4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2
percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Available data indicate that the labor market has continued to strengthen.
o Nonfarm payroll gains averaged about 190,000 in the three months ending in
September, well above the pace that the staff projects is consistent with no
change in resource utilization.
o The unemployment rate edged down to 3.7 percent in September, down
0.4 percentage point since the end of 2017, and below all participants’
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the September
Summary of Economic Projections.
o Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent over the year ending in September
and the Employment Cost Index rose 2.9 percent over the same period,
consistent with a tight labor market amid muted productivity growth.
 Inflation remains close to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent goal.
o The 12-month change in both headline and core PCE prices was 2 percent in
September.
o The staff projects headline and core PCE inflation to remain close to 2 percent
over the medium term.
o Both market- and survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation
expectations continue to be consistent with the view that these expectations
remain stable.
 Financial conditions have recently tightened but remain supportive of the economic
expansion. Although equity prices have declined and house prices have been weaker
than expected, these market developments have not materially altered the outlook.
 The staff estimates that output currently stands about 2½ percent above its potential
level, and anticipates that the output gap will widen to around 3 percent in 2020
before narrowing.
 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced. Although weaker foreign growth and
potential trade policy developments could pose downside risks for economic activity,
it is also possible that fiscal policy will provide a stronger-than-expected boost to
GDP growth.

Policy Strategy
 Policymakers may see economic conditions as continuing to evolve in line with their
expectations. With Alternative B, policymakers would continue to signal that the
economic outlook calls for further gradual increases in the target range for the federal
funds rate, but, in light of the three increases earlier this year, not for an adjustment to
the stance of monetary policy at the November meeting.
o Policymakers may judge that gradual removal of monetary policy
accommodation will continue to be appropriate in order to balance risks
associated with overly tight resource utilization against the risk of unduly
slowing the economy, potentially leading to below-target inflation.
 Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run close to the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent inflation goal as further gradual tightening of monetary policy is
carried out.
o Policymakers may see the removal of accommodation that has taken place
over the past few years, and future gradual increases in the federal funds rate
together with ongoing balance-sheet reductions, as containing the risk that
inflation will rise appreciably above 2 percent.
o Policymakers may also view longer-term inflation expectations as consistent
with achieving the Committee’s inflation objective.
 A statement along the lines of Alternative B seems unlikely to generate appreciable
changes in asset prices. As discussed in the “Monetary Policy Expectations and
Uncertainty” box, financial market quotes indicate that investors regard the odds of a
rate hike at the upcoming meeting as negligible; the next rate hike is viewed as very
likely to occur in December. The assessment of respondents to the Desk’s latest
surveys of primary dealers and market participants is similar.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty
Measures of monetary policy expectations were mostly little changed since the
September FOMC meeting. Investors continue to assign a high probability to a
25basispoint rate increase at the December meeting, and expectations for the
federal funds rate for 2019 and beyond were about unchanged on net.
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures suggests that investors
continue to attach a nearzero probability of a 25basispoint rate hike at the
November meeting, while the probability of a rate increase in December remains
close to 75 percent (the blue bars in figure 1). The calculation of these
probabilities does not take into account a potential technical adjustment to the
interest rate paid on excess reserve balances (IOER). Using the alternative
assumption of a 5basispoint adjustment at the December meeting, these quotes
would instead imply that investors are near certain of a rate hike in December
(the red bar). Results from the November Desk surveys showed that most
respondents expected the spread between the top of the target range for the
federal funds rate and the IOER rate to widen from the current 5 basis points to
10 basis points following the December meeting. Just four respondents
expected a widening following the November meeting.
Figure 2 shows the expected path of the federal funds rate through January
2020, derived from quotes on federal funds futures contracts, assuming zero
term premiums and no rate changes between meetings. The path, which was
little changed on net over the intermeeting period, suggests that the
announcement of press conferences being held after every FOMC meeting
starting in 2019 has not changed market expectations of the timing of rate
changes.
Figure 3 shows that the average probability distribution for the level of the
federal funds rate at the end of 2019, based on Eurodollar options quotes and
assuming zero term premiums, has changed only slightly. It implies that
investors place the highest odds on the federal funds rate being in the 2¾to3
percent range at the end of 2019—which corresponds to a total of three 25basis
point rate hikes between now and the end of 2019—followed closely by the 2½
to2¾ percent range. The corresponding average probability distribution from
the latest Desk surveys (not shown) shows roughly comparable probabilities.
Looking further ahead, figure 4 shows various measures of the expected federal
funds rate over the next few years. A straight read of the marketbased path
derived from overnight index swaps (OIS) quotes (the black line) suggests that
investors expect the federal funds rate to increase through the end of 2019, and
to decline slightly afterwards. Adjusting for term premiums using a staff term
structure model (the light blue line) suggests that investors expect a faster pace
of tightening over the medium term, with about four 25basispoint rate hikes

expected between now and the end of 2019. This modelbased path also
suggests that the federal funds rate will continue to rise gradually in 2020, similar
to the median from the September SEP projections (the blue dots). At horizons
up to early 2020, the modelbased path is similar to the modal projection
reported by the median respondent to the Desk’s latest surveys (the brown line).
However, at longer horizons, the modal path from the surveys lies below the
modelbased path, and falls slightly in the second half of 2021. The surveyimplied
mean path (the golden squares) continues to lie noticeably below the survey
implied modal path beyond 2019.1 This reflects in part the fact that the average
probability that respondents assign to returning to the effective lower bound by
the end of 2021 is about 25 percent. The average surveyimplied mean estimate
for the federal funds rate for the end of 2019 increased by about 50 basis points
relative to the September Desk surveys. This increase is likely attributable, at
least in part, to changes in the phrasing of the survey questions between the
September and November surveys.
Figure 5 shows timeseries measures of the longerrun expected federal funds
rate. A straight read of longterm forward rates implied by Treasury securities
(the red line) suggests that investors’ current expectations for the average
federal funds rate from 5 to 10 years ahead are about 3.2 percent, little changed
from the September FOMC meeting. Adjusting for term premiums using various
staff term structure models (with the blue region showing a range of three such
model estimates) continues to suggest that 5to10yearahead expectations are
above the unadjusted forward rates, at between 3.3 and 3.9 percent. In contrast,
surveys of professional forecasters suggest that longerrun expectations lie at or
below the unadjusted forward rates; the average longerrun forecast from the
June Blue Chip survey (the yellow diamonds) and the median forecast from the
latest Desk surveys (the green diamonds) were 3.0 and 2.9 percent, respectively.
Figure 6 shows responses to a question in the Desk surveys that asks
respondents for their projections for the most likely spread between the IOER
rate and the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), conditional on a range of
possible levels of reserve balances.2 Relative to the August Desk surveys, the
current estimates reflect the recent decline in the IOEREFFR spread to zero. In
addition, the median respondent expects that the EFFR will lie 5 basis points
above the IOER when reserve balances reach a level of $1 trillion.
1 The modal path reflects the median of the respondents’ modal projections for the
federal funds rate through the end of 2021. The surveyimplied mean path is calculated by
averaging over individual respondents’ probability distributions for the end of 2019, 2020 and
2021.
2 Respondents were also asked to rate the importance of various factors in influencing
changes in the IOEREFFR spread between now and endMarch 2019, and between endMarch
and endDecember 2019. Respondents assigned the highest importance to “Treasury
securities supply dynamics” for the first period and to “change in the level of reserve
balances”, and “Treasury securities supply dynamics” as a close second, for the second period.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is operating appreciably beyond full
employment and that economic activity—which is expanding at a faster-than-
sustainable rate—will continue to be spurred by expansionary fiscal policy.
o The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s, is below all
estimates of the longer-run normal level of unemployment reported in the
September Summary of Economic Projections, and is projected to decline
further. Other indicators also point to an already-tight labor market; these
include a high rate of job openings, continued reports of firms having
difficulty hiring workers, and low levels of initial claims for unemployment
insurance.
 Policymakers may predict that unwanted upward pressure on inflation is likely to
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tightness. Policymakers
may point to the fact that average hourly earnings and the Employment Cost Index
rose 2.8 and 2.9 percent, respectively, over the year ending in September, among the
highest 12-month increases since 2009, as evidence of incipient pressures on wage
and price inflation. They may also point to reports that rising input prices have been
bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs as further evidence that inflation may
rise above the Committee’s 2 percent objective for a sustained period.
 Policymakers may judge that the economy is stronger than previously expected.
Payroll gains continue to indicate a tightening of the labor market, and the output gap
is expected to further widen this year. These developments may suggest that the
neutral federal funds rate is higher, and the current monetary policy stance is more
accommodative, than previously estimated.
 Despite eight increases in the target range for the federal funds rate between
December 2015 and September 2018 and a net appreciation of the dollar, financial
conditions have, by some measures, eased on balance since December 2015. The
spreads between rates on certain investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds
and rates on equivalent-maturity Treasury securities remain substantially lower than
in December 2015, even though the use of leverage by speculative grade and unrated
firms has increased over the period and equity prices have recently declined. While
the federal funds rate and key interest rates for household and business borrowers
have increased over the past year, borrowing conditions have not exhibited a
sevitanretlA

--- Page 20 ---

commensurate tightening, in part because of an easing in nonprice credit terms and
standards.
Policy Strategy
 To keep inflation near 2 percent and sustain the economic expansion over the medium
term, policymakers may judge that the target range for the federal funds rate will
likely need to be raised to a higher level than has been suggested by previous FOMC
communications.
o Policymakers may be concerned that ongoing above-trend economic growth
and an already-strong labor market that continues to tighten could soon result
in more notable upward pressure on inflation.
o They may also judge that the federal funds rate needs to be raised to prevent
the unemployment rate from declining significantly further below its normal
longer-run value; such a further decline could make it increasingly
challenging to engineer a soft landing as inflation picks up.
o Additionally, amid still-elevated asset valuations and high levels of debt at
risky firms, in order to avoid a significant buildup of financial imbalances,
policymakers may see the need to signal that gradual rate increases will take
the federal funds rate to a higher level than has been previously communicated
by the Committee.
 Some policymakers may see it as likely that the target range for the federal funds rate
will need to rise to levels that will restrict economic growth in order to reduce the risk
that inflation will rise persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent objective or to
reduce the risk of a build-up in financial imbalances. They may want to communicate
this outlook well in advance of policy becoming modestly restrictive.
 For the above reasons, policymakers may opt to increase the target range for the
federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent at this meeting and indicate that “further
gradual increase” are expected “for some time.”
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that “The Committee is
monitoring inflation developments closely,” signaling concern about the inflation
risks associated with high resource utilization.
 Because financial market participants appear to regard the odds of a rate hike at the
upcoming meeting as negligible, the adoption of Alternative C would surely come as
a surprise. The unexpected increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and
sevitanretlA

Page 17 of 38

--- Page 21 ---

the new language regarding the outlook for policy would likely cause policy
expectations to ratchet up both in the near term and farther out. If, however, a
statement along the lines of Alternative C were issued after a meeting during which
financial market participants had come to anticipate an increase in the target range for
the federal funds rate, near-term policy expectations might not change much, while
those farther ahead would likely rise. In either case, in response to a statement like
Alternative C, medium- and longer-term real interest rates could rise, equity prices
and inflation compensation could fall, and the dollar could appreciate.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Policymakers may see that inflation has moved close to 2 percent and that it is
projected to remain close to that level on a sustained basis.
 Moreover, policymakers may see little evidence of labor market overheating.
o Even as the unemployment rate has ticked down since the beginning of the
year, policymakers may see wage pressures as subdued. While the 12-month
growth rates of average hourly earnings and the employment cost index have
edged up, so has productivity growth, keeping unit labor cost growth
contained and indicating that the low level of the unemployment rate is not
likely to cause inflation to rise appreciably above 2 percent.
 Policymakers may note that the high growth rate of real GDP in the first three
quarters of 2018 was associated with a number of upside surprises, and that real GDP
growth is projected to decline steadily over the next few years, in part reflecting
waning fiscal impetus.
o Policymakers may judge that rising mortgage interest rates have contributed to
recent weaker-than-expected indicators of housing demand.
o Additionally, policymakers may see recent declines in equity prices as
supporting their view that GDP growth is likely to slow further.
 Policymakers could judge that the current level of the federal funds rate lies within
the confidence bands of a range of estimates of the neutral level for the federal funds
rate. Furthermore, they may see developments in Treasury markets—particularly the
flattening yield curve—as supporting the view that current policy is close to neutral.
Policy Strategy
 Policymakers may judge that both objectives of the dual mandate are nearly fulfilled.
They may determine it prudent to leave the target range for the federal funds rate
unchanged for a while as they assess incoming information so as not to undermine the
expansion of economic activity and the sustained return of inflation to 2 percent.
o Policymakers may note that, while the expansion has been robust, the
economy has shown few signs of overheating. The labor market has
improved at a steady pace over the past few years without generating a large
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) November 1, 2018
Page 19 of 38

--- Page 23 ---

increase in either unit labor costs or inflation. Moreover, inflation
expectations have remained stable over this period.
o Policymakers may also view substantial risks associated with tightening too
quickly or too much. Such policy actions could undermine the expansion or
cause inflation to run persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
An overly restrictive policy stance could be reflected in an inversion of the
yield curve, something that has in the past been associated with recessions.
Furthermore, a slowdown in growth abroad or trade policy developments
could also restrain the economy over the near term.
o Policymakers might note that monetary policy affects economic activity with
a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that has taken place over the
past few years will continue to act as a restraint on economic growth for some
time, mitigating the need for more increases in the target range for the federal
funds rate at this stage. They may see soft readings on housing demand as
evidence that previous increases in the federal funds rate are already affecting
the housing market. Additionally, policymakers may note that, as the Federal
Reserve’s asset holdings continue to decline, the downward pressure on
longer-term yields those holdings induce will diminish.
 Policymakers may continue to view the current state of the financial system as sound
and the potential for a buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, or they may
judge that interest rate policy is not an effective means of addressing any significant
financial stability concerns that may emerge.
 A statement along the lines of Alternative A would reduce expectations of rate hikes
in the near future. Such a statement could cause medium and longer-term interest
rates to fall, while also leading to a depreciation of the dollar. Equity prices and
inflation compensation could rise.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range for the federal funds
rate, an implementation note that indicates no change to the Federal Reserve’s
administered rates—the interest rate on required and excess reserve balances, the offering
rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primary credit rate—would be
issued. If the Committee decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, an
implementation note that communicates the changes the Federal Reserve decided to make
in these three policy tools would be issued. Draft implementation notes that correspond
to these two cases appear on the following pages; the implementation note for the latter
case assumes that a technical adjustment to the setting of the interest rate on required and
excess reserve balances would be made at this meeting. Struck-out text indicates
language deleted from the September directive and implementation note, bold red

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ]
to raise maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve
balances to at 2.20 percent, effective September 27 November 9, 2018.
 As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy
directive:
“Effective September 27 November 9, 2018, the Federal Open Market
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as
necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to
2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and
reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading

Balance Sheet and Income Projections
The staff has prepared projections of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and
elements of the associated income statement that are consistent with the baseline
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A. Key features of these projections are
described below.
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments. As reported in the exhibit titled
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the staff projects that
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017 will lead to the
redemption of $229 billion of Treasury securities and about $152 billion of agency
securities over 2018. During this same period, reinvestments of principal payments on
Treasury and agency securities are projected to be $197 billion and $88 billion,
respectively. Under the staff’s current baseline forecast, no further reinvestments of
agency securities are projected to occur given the October 2018 increase in the cap on
monthly redemptions of agency securities to $20 billion.1 However, the projections for
agency securities are subject to considerable uncertainty because unscheduled
prepayments depend on factors that are difficult to predict, including the realized path of
mortgage rates.2
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet. One key assumption behind the
balance sheet projection is that the longer-run level of reserve balances will be
$500 billion.3 Under the baseline assumptions, the staff currently projects that this level
1 Future reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury securities will take place primarily in
the middle month of each quarter.
2 If principal payments of agency securities received were to breach the $20 billion monthly
redemption cap before the size of the balance sheet is normalized, then the Desk would reinvest in agency
MBS the amount by which the principal payments received during any month exceed the $20 billion
redemption cap. For further details, see the FOMC memo titled “Operational Readiness for MBS
Reinvestments” (June 2018).
3 Other noteworthy assumptions about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:
The Treasury General Account is assumed to increase in line with nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in
circulation are assumed to increase at an average annual pace of about 6 percent through 2020 and at the
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated
financial market utilities remain at their average September 2018 levels of approximately $230 billion and
$65 billion, respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to maintain its September
2018 average of about $10 billion until reserve balances reach $1 trillion, at which point take-up declines to
zero over the subsequent year.

of reserve balances will be reached in the third quarter of 2021, about one quarter later
than in the September Tealbook projection.4 As of the end of September, reserve
balances have declined by about $300 billion since the normalization program began, and
by about $1 trillion since the month-end peak of reserve balances was reached in August
2014 (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table
that follows the exhibit).
From the start of the balance sheet reduction program in October 2017 to its
projected conclusion at the time of normalization in 2021, the Federal Reserve’s
securities holdings are predicted to decline about $1.3 trillion, with holdings of Treasury
and agency securities shrinking about $800 billion and $500 billion, respectively. When
the size of the balance sheet is normalized, the SOMA portfolio is projected to be a touch
less than $3 trillion, consisting of about $1.7 trillion in Treasury securities and $1.3
trillion in agency securities.
Once the declines in asset holdings associated with normalization have taken
place, the size of the balance sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal
GDP, compared with a peak of about 25 percent in 2014 and a pre-crisis average of about
6 percent. After the size of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will begin
to rise, keeping pace with the increases in Federal Reserve liabilities—including Federal
Reserve notes in circulation and the Treasury General Account (TGA)—as well as
Federal Reserve Bank capital. Expressed as shares of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve
assets and liabilities are expected to edge down.
Federal Reserve remittances. Remittances to the Treasury are projected to
decline to $63 billion this year from $80 billion in 2017 (see the “Income Projections”
exhibit).5 This decline primarily reflects the realized and expected increases in the
interest rate paid on reserve balances in 2018; total interest expense is projected to rise by
4 Generally speaking, the size of the balance sheet is considered to be normalized when the
resumption of purchases of Treasury securities is required to satisfy the demand for reserve balances and
accommodate the expansion of key non-reserve liability items.
5 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus. First, $2.5 billion was transferred in February following an
amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in
February 2018. Second, $675 million was transferred in June, reflecting another amendment to Section 7
by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in May 2018.

$15 billion to $44 billion this year.6 In addition, the reduction in SOMA securities
holdings this year results in a slight decrease in projected interest income to $112 billion.
As interest expense on reserve balances increases with a higher target range for the
federal funds rate, and as interest income decreases with lower asset holdings,
remittances are expected to decline further and to bottom out at $33 billion in 2020.
Thereafter, remittances increase due to both a decrease in interest expense as the target
range for the federal funds rate is projected to decline, and an increase in interest income
once the Desk resumes purchases of Treasury securities for the SOMA portfolio.
The projected path for remittances over the next few years is similar to that in the
September Tealbook. As shown in the bottom left panel of the “Income Projections”
exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the
projection period, slightly higher than their pre-crisis average.
Unrealized gains or losses. The SOMA portfolio was in a net unrealized loss
position of about $66 billion at the end of September.7 With longer-term interest rates
expected to rise further over the next few years, the unrealized loss position is expected to
peak at $280 billion in 2020:Q1. Of this amount, $119 billion is attributable to Treasury
securities and $161 billion to agency MBS. The unrealized loss position subsequently
narrows, in large part because the value of securities acquired under the Federal
Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs returns to par as those securities approach
maturity. The net unrealized position is projected to be a bit lower in the near term
compared to the September Tealbook.
Term premium effect. As shown in the table “Projections for the 10-Year
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result of the Federal
Reserve’s asset purchase programs are currently estimated to be reducing the term
premium in the 10-year Treasury yield by about 75 basis points, the same as projected in
6 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25-basis-point-wide target range for the federal
funds rate throughout the projection period. Consistent with the September FOMC Implementation Note,
we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will be set five basis points below the top of the
target range for the federal funds rate. We continue to assume that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will
be set at the bottom of the range.

potential implications for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its obligations, see Brian Bonis, Lauren
Fiesthumel, and Jamie Noonan (2018), “SOMA’s Unrealized Loss: What Does It Mean?” FEDS Notes

the previous Tealbook; this effect fades gradually over time. The estimated path of the
term premium effect depends on the difference between the expected path of the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years and a counterfactual projection based on the
configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 20072008.
In this counterfactual projection it is assumed that reserve balances reach their longer-run
level at $100 billion.
SOMA characteristics. As shown in the top panel of the “Projections for the
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average
duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about six years. This measure is
projected to increase over the course of balance sheet normalization as redemptions
continue and longer-duration securities become a larger share of the portfolio. In terms
of the composition of the portfolio, the share of agency MBS is expected to peak at 44
percent shortly before the size of the balance sheet is expected to be normalized,
reflecting the faster pace of roll-offs of Treasury securities, and then to decline to 30
percent at the end of 2024.
After normalization of the size of the balance sheet in 2021, the duration of the
SOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to decline as the Desk begins adding securities to
the SOMA portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reserve liabilities. The
initial sharp decline in duration results from the staff’s assumption that the Desk will
purchase only Treasury bills until these securities account for one-third of the Federal
Reserve’s Treasury securities portfolio, close to their pre-crisis share.8 Thereafter,
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum
(see the bottom panel of the exhibit titled “Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA
Treasury Securities Holdings”).
8 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operations, the SOMA portfolio currently
contains no Treasury bills.
