Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

The incoming data have corroborated our view that the slowdown in economic D
n
activity in the first quarter of the year would be transitory. Indeed, real GDP in the o
c
E
second quarter now looks to have increased at an annual rate of 4¾ percent, a c
ti
s
considerably larger rebound than we had anticipated.1 In the second half of the year, we e
m
estimate that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of 2½ percent. This pace is slower than o
D
we projected in June, as some of the second-quarter surprise is expected to unwind, but it
is still sufficient to further widen the gap between actual and potential output. Labor
market conditions have continued to tighten, and, on a quarterly basis, the unemployment
rate declined slightly to 3.9 percent in the second quarter, ¾ percentage point below our
estimate of its natural rate. With above-trend output growth, the unemployment rate is
expected to edge down further through year-end.
After rising almost 3 percent this year, real GDP is projected to decelerate in 2019
and 2020 amid the ongoing tightening in monetary policy and the emergence of some
modest supply constraints. GDP rises faster than potential through 2019 and then moves
about in line with it in 2020. At the end of the medium term, the output gap remains in
excess of 3 percent. We continue to project that the unemployment rate will have moved
down to 3½ percent by that time, 1¼ percentage points below our estimate of its natural
rate. These medium-term projections are little changed relative to June, reflecting small
and largely offsetting revisions to our financial assumptions and other conditioning
factors.
The incoming information on consumer prices has been broadly consistent with
our expectations. The 12-month change in core PCE prices is estimated to have been
1.9 percent in June, and this measure of core inflation is expected to remain near that
level through the end of the year. In the medium term, core PCE price inflation is
forecast to move up gradually and reach 2.1 percent in 2020, as labor and product
markets tighten further. Total PCE price inflation is projected to run a touch below core
inflation after this year, reflecting the declining path for consumer energy prices in the
1 The BEA will release its advance estimate of 2018:Q2 real GDP growth (along with
comprehensive revisions to the national accounts) on Friday, July 27.

The July Tealbook projection for real GDP growth is in line with the Blue Chip
n
o
consensus forecast in 2018 and ¼ percentage point higher in 2019. The staff’s
c
E
unemployment rate forecast is near the Blue Chip consensus in 2018 and 2019. The
c
s
ti
staff projections for total CPI inflation are below the Blue Chip consensus forecasts in
e
m both 2018 and 2019. (Note that projections from the Survey of Professional
o
D Forecasters are more than two months old.)

medium term. As before, these projections incorporate our assumption that modest t l

supply constraints will result in slightly higher inflation than would otherwise be the case.
&

Finally, we estimate that the effects of recently implemented tariffs—including e
D
n
those on steel, aluminum, and certain imports from China—along with our trading o
c
E
partners’ responses to those tariffs will be minimal both for overall net exports and for
c
ti
aggregate prices. Other potential tariff changes remain highly uncertain and are not s
e
m
included in our projection, but their possible effects are discussed in the Risks and o
D
Uncertainty section.
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection
calls for the federal funds rate to increase ¾ percentage point over the
remainder of this year and to rise, on average, 1 percentage point per year for
the following two years, reaching 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.
This trajectory is a touch steeper than in the June Tealbook, reflecting the
slightly higher output gap over the medium term.
• The size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predictable decline as
securities are redeemed in a manner consistent with the Committee’s June
2017 Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and with
the process initiated in October 2017.
Other Interest Rates
• The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise from an average of about
3 percent in the current quarter to 4¼ percent by the end of 2020. The
projected yield over the next few quarters is revised down somewhat,
reflecting lower-than-expected market quotes since the June Tealbook; the
yield is little revised from the end of 2019 onward.
• The 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond yield are also
projected to rise significantly over the medium term. Over the projection
period, both rates are revised in line with revisions to the path of the 10-year
Treasury yield.

t l Equity Prices and Home Prices
u
O
& • Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter about 3 percent above
l
e
v the June Tealbook forecast, reflecting recent increases in broad equity price
e
D
indexes. Beyond the current quarter, we forecast stock prices to rise at an
n
o
c average annual rate of around ½ percent, similar to our previous projection.
E
c
ti
e s • In response to strong incoming data through May, we pushed up our forecast
m
o for house price growth through the end of 2019. However, with house prices
D
running above the level suggested by their historical relationship with rents
and with interest rates also rising, we expect some downward pressure on
house price appreciation over the medium term. Specifically, we project
house price growth will slow from 7 percent this year to 3¼ percent in 2020.
At the end of 2020, the projected level of house prices is 2½ percent higher
than in the June Tealbook.
Fiscal Policy
• We estimate that discretionary fiscal policy actions across all levels of
government will contribute ½ percentage point to GDP growth in 2018,
exclusive of any multiplier effects and offsets from associated reactions in
interest rates and the dollar. Reflecting the lagged effects of recent legislative
actions, the impetus to GDP growth from policy actions is projected to remain
around ½ percentage point in 2019 and 2020.
Roughly one-half of the medium-term impetus is due to the recent tax
o
cuts, and about one-fourth of it is due to the recent federal spending
increases; the remainder is attributable to state and local government
spending.
• The federal deficit is projected to rise from 3½ percent of GDP in fiscal year
2017 to 5½ percent in fiscal 2020—an increase that primarily reflects the
effects of the recently enacted tax and spending legislation.
We continue to assume that, in the longer run, policymakers will enact
o
measures that gradually reduce deficits by an amount sufficient to stabilize
the debt-to-GDP ratio. The magnitude of the budget adjustments needed
to reach a sustainable path for debt are discussed in the box “Federal Debt
and Deficits: The 10-Year Outlook under Two Fiscal Policy Scenarios.”

We also continue to assume that recent fiscal actions will not change the t l
o u
O
longer-run equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate, as the current
&
l
stimulus to aggregate demand will eventually be offset by contractionary e
v
e
policy actions that stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. However, we judge D
n
that the debt-to-GDP ratio will stabilize at a level that is 20 percentage o
c
E
points higher than it would have been absent those recent policy actions, c
ti
s
and, in turn, the higher debt-to-GDP ratio will push up the longer-run term e
m
premium on 10-year Treasury securities by 50 basis points. o
D
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
• Real GDP growth in the foreign economies is estimated to have moderated to
an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter, a little lower than in the
previous Tealbook, as a rebound in growth in some advanced foreign
economies (AFEs) was more than offset by a broad-based slowing in the
emerging market economies (EMEs). We continue to foresee GDP growth
abroad edging up to a near-potential pace of 2¾ percent in the second half of
this year and remaining there over the forecast period.
• The broad nominal dollar index has moved up about 1¾ percent since the June
Tealbook. The dollar appreciation against AFE currencies was broad based.
The appreciation was also notable against EME currencies, especially the
Chinese renminbi, which weakened about 6 percent, the largest intermeeting
move over the past two decades. The dollar index would have increased
substantially more but for a rally of the Mexican peso on easing market
concerns about the economic policies of Mexico’s president-elect. We expect
the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of about 2 percent through
the forecast horizon, as market expectations for the federal funds rate move up
toward the staff forecast. The broad real dollar at the end of the forecast
horizon is about 1¾ percent higher than projected in June largely because of
the recent appreciation.
Oil and Commodity Prices
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $5 per barrel, on net, since
the June Tealbook, closing most recently around $73 per barrel. Oil prices
moved down in early July in response to a loosening of OPEC supply
constraints, improved supply conditions in Libya, and market concerns about

Federal Debt and Deficits: The 10-Year Outlook under Two Fiscal
&
l Policy Scenarios
e
v
e
D
Federal debt held by the public is at its highest level as a percent of GDP in the past
n
o
70 years and is projected to rise further. A high and rising debt-to-GDP ratio has
c
E
important consequences for the economy, including a reduction in national savings,
c
s
ti
upward pressure on interest rates, an increase in debt service costs, a reduced capacity
e
m to use deficit spending to address unexpected events such as a recession, and an
o
D increase in the likelihood of a fiscal crisis. In this discussion, we describe projections of
deficits and debt under different fiscal policy scenarios using estimates from the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
The change in the debt-to-GDP ratio over time is affected by the primary deficit (outlays
excluding interest payments minus receipts), the growth rate of nominal GDP, and the
effective nominal interest rate on debt. Higher primary deficits and interest rates push
up the debt-to-GDP ratio, while greater GDP growth restrains it.1
Assuming current law remains largely unchanged, the CBO projects that the debt-to-
GDP ratio will rise from 78 percent in fiscal year 2018 to 96 percent by the end of fiscal
2028—red line in the left panel of the figure—driven by continued primary deficits and
an increase in the effective interest rate on the debt.2 As shown by the red line in the
right panel of the figure, the primary deficit under current law is expected to be around
2 percent from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2028. This deficit is lower than the expected fiscal
2018 deficit because, under current law, the higher caps on appropriations enacted by
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) expire at the end of fiscal 2019, when the caps
revert to the levels set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. In addition, tax revenues are
expected to increase under current law as temporary provisions in the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (TCJA)—including most of the individual income tax provisions and lower tax
rates for pass-through businesses—expire at the end of 2025.3
There is substantial uncertainty about the path of fiscal policy in general and whether
the temporary tax cuts and spending increases will expire in particular. The budget
outlook is substantially different if these provisions remain in place. Under an
1 Nominal GDP growth and effective interest rates affect the debt-to-GDP ratio similarly. As a
result, their combined effect can be assessed by subtracting nominal GDP growth from the effective
interest rate. On average over the past 30 years, the nominal growth rate of GDP has been roughly
equal to the effective interest rate on the national debt. More recently, however, nominal GDP
growth has exceeded the interest rate on debt and offset some of the upward pressure on the debt-
to-GDP ratio from primary deficits.
2 The CBO projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will increase further, to over 150 percent of GDP in
fiscal 2048. Since 1792, federal debt has exceeded 100 percent of GDP only from 1945 to 1947, near the
end of WWII.
3 These temporary tax cuts and spending increases have changed the budget outlook
considerably. Cumulatively, between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2028 the TCJA and BBA are expected to add
roughly 8 percentage points to the debt-to-GDP ratio.

alternative current policy baseline where the BBA and the TCJA are extended O
indefinitely beginning in fiscal 2020, primary deficits are projected to increase to roughly &
4 percent of GDP by fiscal 2028 (blue line in the right panel of the figure).4 As a result, e l
v
the federal debt is projected to grow to 107 percent of GDP over the next 10 years (blue e
D
line in left panel of the figure). n
o
c
E
Under either scenario, stabilization of the debt-to-GDP ratio will require substantial c
ti
deficit reduction that is likely to reduce the growth of aggregate demand. Consider the e s
m
reductions needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio by eliminating the primary deficit
o
over 10 years (starting in fiscal 2019 and assuming that the interest rate on debt is equal D
to the growth rate of nominal GDP). Under current law, the required deficit reductions
would be, on average, 0.2 percent of GDP per year for a cumulative reduction of
2 percent. Under current policy, the comparable reductions would be, on average,
0.4 percent of GDP per year, for a cumulative reduction of 4 percent of GDP. Holding all
else equal, such reductions would be expected to restrain aggregate demand growth
each year by magnitudes roughly equal to the deficit effects. Assuming monetary
policy is not constrained (for example, by the effective lower bound on the federal
funds rate), it could crowd in some of that lost demand. However, such action would
leave a smaller buffer available for the Fed to respond to a recession.
Federal Debt and Primary Deficits

payment timing.

taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act are repealed.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
Real GDP in the second quarter appears to have increased at an annual rate of
4¾ percent, an even larger rebound than we projected in the June Tealbook. That said,
most of the revision was due to a jump in agricultural exports and a stronger-than-
expected increase in defense spending, both of which we expect to be unwound by the
end of the year.2 Meanwhile, our second-quarter estimate of the contribution to GDP
growth from private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—the portion of GDP we think
provides a better signal of the underlying pace of aggregate demand—was around
3 percentage points, ¼ percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook.
In light of the sources of revisions to second-quarter real GDP growth, and given
that recent labor market data have been broadly consistent with our expectations, our
assessment of the overall cyclical position of the economy is little revised. Accordingly,
we continue to estimate that the level of output was 2 percent above its potential in the
second quarter, and that the output gap will move up further over the next two quarters,
ending the year at 2½ percent.
• Recent monthly spending data have confirmed our expectation that the first-
quarter weakness in PCE was transitory, and our estimate of its growth in the
second quarter now stands at an annual rate of 3½ percent. Retail sales
registered sizable gains over the three months ending in June, and motor
vehicle sales stabilized after having fallen in the first quarter. Given signs of
2 In principle, with the relevant soybean production estimates little revised since the June
Tealbook, the positive effect on U.S. GDP growth from the surge in soybean exports should be offset by a
large drawdown of soybean inventories. However, based on the experience of the third quarter of 2016,
which also featured an extreme spike in soybean exports, we expect that the BEA may not report such a
large inventory offset.

• After increasing at a rapid clip in the first quarter, business fixed investment E

appears to have moderated to a still-solid pace of 6 percent in the second s

financial conditions and the recent tax legislation. Moreover, despite a
number of anecdotal reports that firms are concerned about trade issues,
readings on business sentiment and profit expectations have stayed upbeat.
We therefore still project that nonresidential private fixed investment will rise
at an annual rate of around 6 percent in the second half of the year.
• Activity in the housing sector appears to have ticked down again in the second
quarter, likely reflecting the drag from rising mortgage rates. A variety of
forward-looking indicators—including single-family construction permits,
pending home sales, and the Michigan survey index of homebuying
conditions—point to a further softening in housing activity in the second half
of the year. In all, residential investment is expected to edge down about
1¼ percent over 2018 as a whole.
• In the government sector, an anomalously large increase in defense outlays in
June pushed up our estimate of the growth in real government purchases in the
second quarter. These outlays are volatile, and thus we did not alter our
projection for the level of defense purchases in coming quarters.
Consequently, government purchases in the latter half of the year are
projected to rise more slowly than in the first half of the year and by less than
we projected in the June Tealbook.
• Net exports are estimated to have added about 1¼ percentage points to U.S.
GDP growth in the second quarter. This estimate is about 1 percentage point
larger than in the June Tealbook, as exports were much stronger and imports
were weaker than expected. Much of the strength in exports reflected a surge
in soybean exports, which, on a seasonally adjusted basis, doubled in volume
between April and May. Although China announced in early April potential
tariffs on soybeans that were implemented only in early July, the surge in

D
calling for a sizable increase in the third quarter and readings on new orders
from manufacturing surveys still elevated, we expect the pace of
manufacturing output growth to improve to 2¾ percent in the second half of
the year.
For the medium term, we continue to project that real GDP growth will move
down from about 3 percent this year to 2½ percent in 2019 and then to 1¾ percent in
2020. The gradual deceleration reflects the ongoing tightening of monetary policy and
the emergence of some modest supply constraints.
• The effects of changes in financial markets were largely offsetting for the
projection. Upward surprises in equity and house prices, coupled with
downward surprises in long-term interest rates, were mostly counterbalanced
by the appreciation of the dollar since the June Tealbook.
• Real GDP growth is projected to outpace potential growth through 2019 and
then to run essentially in line with potential in 2020, resulting in a further
tightening of resource utilization over the medium term. At the end of 2020,
real GDP exceeds its potential level by more than 3 percent—a touch more
than in the June Tealbook.
• With the federal government expected to run historically large and rising
deficits over the medium term, national saving is projected to trend downward
as a share of GDP. Nevertheless, private investment trends upward as a share
of the economy, with the widening gap between domestic investment and
national saving financed by increased inflows of foreign capital.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET u t
O
&
The June employment report indicated that labor market conditions have
l
e
v
continued to strengthen. Payroll gains were a little higher than expected and remained e
D
well above the range we associate with unchanged resource utilization. The labor force n
o
c
participation rate (LFPR) and the unemployment rate were both higher than expected, but E
c
the employment-to-population ratio was in line with the June Tealbook. s
ti
e
m
o
• According to the BLS, total nonfarm payrolls increased 213,000 in June and D
the estimated gains for April and May were revised up.3 After making a small
upward adjustment to our payroll employment forecast in the near term, we
now expect total nonfarm payroll gains to average 200,000 per month in the
second half of the year, a touch slower than the average monthly increases of
215,000 in the first half of the year.
• The unemployment rate moved up to 4 percent in June, whereas we had
expected it to decline to 3.7 percent. The jump in the unemployment rate was
due to an unusually large number of net entrants into the labor force;
accordingly, the LFPR moved up 0.2 percentage point, to 62.9 percent.
Meanwhile, the employment-to-population ratio held steady in June at
60.4 percent, the same as our June Tealbook forecast. In response, we nudged
up our unemployment rate and LFPR forecasts in the near term, leaving the
projected updrift in the employment-to-population ratio unrevised.
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed, the outlook for the
labor market is similar to our June Tealbook projection. We still expect the labor market
to tighten further over the medium term, in line with above-trend GDP growth. We also
continue to assume that, in an extremely tight labor market, a larger-than-usual amount of
the tightening in resource utilization will manifest in a higher LFPR and a smaller-than-
usual amount in a lower unemployment rate.
• Average monthly total payroll gains slow gradually in the projection, from
about 200,000 in the second half of this year to about 130,000 in 2020.
3 The staff’s alternative measure of private payroll changes that combines BLS information with
data from the payroll processing firm ADP paints a similar picture of recent job gains: The three-month
moving average of the staff estimate stood at 212,000 in June, compared with the average increase of
205,000 in BLS estimates of private payrolls.

D • The box “Alternative View: Supply Constraints Will Prevent the
Unemployment Rate from Falling Much Further” argues that constraints on
aggregate supply will be more severe than assumed in the baseline, and
therefore that the boost to aggregate demand from fiscal stimulus and other
factors will have smaller effects on the unemployment rate.
• We project that productivity will increase about 1 percent per year, on
average, over the forecast period, a bit below our estimate of its
structural pace.
The box “Innovation and Productivity Growth in the Manufacturing
o
Sector” provides an analysis of factors contributing to the productivity
slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which has been disproportionately
important in influencing overall productivity trends.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The incoming price data have been largely in line with our expectations. We
estimate the 12-month change in core PCE prices to have been 1.9 percent in June; we
continue to expect core inflation will maintain a similar pace through the end of the year.
Total PCE prices are estimated to have increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending
in June, slightly lower than in the previous Tealbook, as consumer energy prices were a
little softer than expected. Given the projected path for energy prices, we forecast the
12-month change in total PCE prices to move down to 1.9 percent in September and to
remain there through year-end.
• The May reading on core PCE price inflation was close to our expectations in
the June Tealbook. Upward revisions to the estimates for previous months
were due to nonmarket price categories, from which we typically draw little
signal for the forecast. The translation of the June CPI release implied a

c
• Core import prices are estimated to have increased at a 2 percent pace in the s

first half of 2018, ¾ percentage point less than in the June Tealbook. For the
o
D
second half of 2018, core import prices are expected to fall at an annual rate of
1 percent, reflecting lower commodity prices and dollar appreciation. In
2019, import price inflation is expected to recover to a still-modest ½ percent
pace, consistent with moderate foreign inflation and a gradually appreciating
dollar.
• PCE energy prices appear to have leveled off in the second quarter following
sizable increases in the previous two quarters. With oil prices having moved
down since the June Tealbook, we reduced the projected rise in PCE energy
prices in the second half of the year, from an annual rate of 4½ percent in the
previous projection to a rate of around 1 percent in the current projection. In
2019 and 2020, consumer energy prices are expected to decline modestly.
• PCE food prices were about flat in the first quarter, but we estimate that they
increased at an annual rate of 1¼ percent in the second quarter. Since the
June Tealbook, reductions in spot and futures prices for agricultural
commodities have led us to revise down our forecast for PCE food prices in
the second half. That said, we expect food price inflation to move up to
2 percent by the end of this year and to run at 2½ percent over the next
two years.
• In the preliminary July report from the University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers, median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years moved
down to 2.4 percent, at the low end of the range of values for this series over
the past year. That said, a number of other recent readings on longer-term
inflation expectations have held steady, and, on balance, the available
information continues to suggest that these expectations remain reasonably
stable.

Alternative View: Supply Constraints Will Prevent the
&
l Unemployment Rate from Falling Much Further
e
v
e
D
Here we argue that the staff projection for the unemployment rate is too strong because the
n
o
labor market is already tight and hence unlikely to improve much further. With the
c
E
unemployment rate (4.0 percent) well below our estimate of its natural rate (4.7 percent), the
c
s
ti
typical transmission of an increase in aggregate demand—including that from the recent fiscal
e
m policy changes—no longer applies. In particular, we think that the boost to aggregate demand
o
D from fiscal stimulus and other factors will have much smaller effects on the unemployment rate
than in the staff baseline because of constraints on aggregate supply.
Supply constraints are currently most noticeable in the labor market. Firms are increasingly
reporting that it is difficult to find workers. The number of job openings relative to the number of
unemployed persons is at an all‐time high, and the fraction of small businesses reporting at least
one hard‐to‐fill job opening is close to its all‐time high. Anecdotal information on the difficulty of
finding workers appears frequently in the news and in the Beige Book.
In search‐and‐matching models of the labor market, aggregate output is substantially less
responsive to expansionary shocks in a booming economy with a very tight labor market than in
an economy with average macroeconomic conditions.1 We demonstrate the quantitative effects
of supply constraints in a model similar to one developed in Gertler, Sala, and Trigari (2008).2 In
this model, the scarcity of workers relative to vacant jobs in a tight economy leads to increasingly
higher wages and marginal costs. As a consequence, stark nonlinearities in macroeconomic
behavior take hold when the pool of available unemployed workers is close to being exhausted.

In figure 1, we compare impulse responses from a similar increase in aggregate demand in both a O
“normal” economy and a “tight” economy. The solid blue lines show the responses for a normal &
l
economy, such as the first quarter of 2016 when the unemployment rate was 5 percent. This e
v
increase in demand lowers the unemployment rate 30 basis points and raises the inflation rate e
D
25 basis points. The dashed lines show the responses for a tight economy, such as the first n
o
quarter of 2018 when the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent. The unemployment rate decrease c
E
in the tighter labor market is considerably smaller while the inflation response is significantly c
ti
larger. e s
m
o
In the Tealbook projection, supply constraints play a small role. In the absence of supply D
constraints, the unemployment rate would bottom out at almost 1½ percentage points below the
staff estimate of the natural rate. Supply constraints push up on the unemployment rate by only
0.1 percentage point. We think that this adjustment is too small and should be, instead, around
0.5 percentage point. As figure 2 shows, an increase in demand would lower the unemployment
rate 1 percentage point, instead of 1½ percentage points, when supply constraints are taken into
account.3
Several papers are consistent with our view. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) find that
government spending multipliers are much smaller in booms than in recessions.4 Also, Baum,
Poplawski‐Ribeiro, and Weber (2012) find that government revenue multipliers are smaller when
the output gap is positive.5 In sum, we argue that the staff projection has taken too much signal
from the fiscal stimulus and other impetuses to aggregate demand and has not accounted
enough for the effects of supply constraints.

imposes no limits to the decline in the unemployment rate. The dashed line is the nonlinear impulse response
function to the same shock, assuming that the economy is initially in a situation like it was in 2016:Q1.

Innovation and Productivity Growth in the Manufacturing Sector
l
e
v
e
D Labor productivity growth in the U.S. private business sector slowed substantially around 2004
n
o and again around 2010, shown by the red dots in figure 1 on the next page, with particularly sharp
c
E declines in the manufacturing sector, shown by the light blue bars.1 This slowdown is partly
c
ti attributable to weaker contributions from capital services and labor quality, but another
s
e
m important contributor was slower total factor productivity (TFP) growth (dark blue bars), the
o gains in output produced from a given quantity of inputs.2 Although manufacturing makes up
D
only 15 percent of private business value added, it was responsible for over half of the slowdown
in TFP growth in the overall business sector. Because of this outsized importance, as well as the
advantages from greater data availability, this discussion analyzes the sources of the TFP
slowdown in the manufacturing sector. It is instructive to think of gains in TFP as arising in three
steps: innovation, adoption, and reallocation.
1. Innovation. In the first step, businesses engage in research and development (R&D) to
expand the technical frontier. Measured as a fraction of output, R&D by U.S.
manufacturing firms has actually been somewhat higher during the productivity
slowdown than before it (table 1, row 1 on the next page). Nevertheless, the issuance of
manufacturing patents to U.S. entities—an indicator of R&D output—slowed in the years
2004 to 2009 (row 2).3 In light of oft-cited delays between patent issuances and
technological adoption, the decline in patent issuance from 2004 to 2009 suggests that a
decline in innovation could provide one explanation for the more recent decline in TFP.
Patent issuance accelerated more recently, which, if sustained, may bode well for future
productivity gains.
2. Adoption. In the second step, firms adopt innovations that enhance productivity and
expand the production frontier. These adopted innovations include new product designs
that raise product performance and process improvements that drive down production
costs. Although tracking the general rate of improvement in products and processes is
1 In this discussion, we take the productivity data at face value. Although mismeasurement of productivity is
a concern, research generally supports the broad conclusion that actual productivity growth has slowed. Another
concern is that the timing of the slowdown in TFP growth may be affected by cyclical changes in factor utilization
(both hours per employee and the workweek of capital), which dropped during the Great Recession and
rebounded afterward. Removing this cyclical effect would raise productivity growth from 2004 to 2009 and
temper growth from 2010 to 2016. Consequently, the slowdown from 2004 to 2009 is likely to be overstated and
the further slowdown after 2010 to be understated. See Susanto Basu, John Fernald, and Miles Kimball (2006),
“Are Technology Improvements Contractionary?” American Economic Review, vol. 96 (December), pp. 1418–48.
2 Given its common interpretation as a measure of the stock of applied knowledge, outright declines in TFP
such as those for manufacturing from 2010 to 2016 are often difficult to rationalize. Most explanations point to
mismeasurement of prices, output, utilization of inputs, or profit margins. In addition, a change in the mix of
industrial activities within manufacturing could increase the value-added share of low-TFP plants, lowering
average TFP.
3 For other research citing a slowdown in innovation, see Nicholas Bloom, Charles I. Jones, John Van Reenen,
and Michael Webb (2017), “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” NBER Working Paper Series 23782 (Cambridge,
Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, September), www.nber.org/papers/w23782.

difficult, indicators of improvement for two portions of the manufacturing sector O
softened from 2010 to 2016. Gains in computational speed for leading-edge computing &
l
equipment—a barometer for electronics manufacturing more broadly—have slowed e
v
markedly (row 3). In addition, output per unit of energy input for key energy-intensive e
D
manufacturing industries stalled from 2010 to 2016 (row 4).4 n
o
c
E
3. Reallocation. In the final step, labor and capital are reallocated both within and across c
ti
firms toward the expanded production frontier. Differences in output per worker across s
e
m
firms tend to be narrow when innovations diffuse rapidly and outmoded production
o
processes are eliminated. Yet recent evidence from Census microdata shows that D
dispersion of productivity across manufacturing firms has risen in the United States,
suggesting that innovations may be spreading more slowly and that less-efficient
producers are not being winnowed as quickly as previously (row 5).5
All told, softening manufacturing productivity growth since 2003 appears to reflect weaker
innovation, slower adoption, and less robust reallocation of resources. Because TFP-driven
improvements to manufactured equipment and materials spur capital deepening that raises
productivity throughout the economy, the importance of productivity growth in manufacturing is
much greater than the sector’s small size would indicate. Looking ahead, a recent increase in
manufacturing patents may herald a TFP pickup in the future. If a rebound in manufacturing TFP
were to occur, it would lend credence to our projection of a modest pickup in overall business-
sector productivity.

Our medium-term outlook for total and core PCE price inflation is little revised. t l
u
O
We still project that core inflation will move up to 2 percent in 2019 and 2.1 percent in
&
l
2020, reflecting an upward drift in trend inflation and the upward pressure on prices from e
v
e
elevated rates of resource utilization. Total PCE price inflation is projected to run D
n
slightly below core inflation after this year, reflecting the declining path for consumer o
c
E
energy prices in the medium term. As before, these projections are predicated on our c
ti
s
assumption that the emergence of some modest supply constraints will result in slightly e
m
higher inflation than would otherwise be the case. o
D
We continue to forecast that strong labor market conditions will bring about a
further step-up in the growth of compensation per hour, from 3 percent this year to a
4 percent pace in 2019 and 2020. Given its relatively muted cyclical properties, the ECI
is projected to accelerate less than the compensation per hour measure in the
medium term.
• In line with our expectation in the June Tealbook, average hourly earnings of
all employees increased 2¾ percent over the 12 months ending in June, up
from the 2 percent rates of increase seen a few years ago.
• The June reading from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth
Tracker was 3.2 percent, below its recent highs but well above the pace
observed a few years ago.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be
4.7 percent and that potential output growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the
longer run.
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. The nominal yield on
10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent in the longer run.
Thus, after the SOMA portfolio has returned to its normal size and
composition, the term premium is assumed to be 90 basis points, lifted by the
elevated level of federal debt assumed over the longer run.
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
Page 25 of 122

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2018
k
o
o
t l extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
u
O
normal size by mid-2021.
&
l
e
v
e • With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows further to 1½ percent in 2021
D
n and to slightly above 1 percent in 2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate is
o
c
E above its neutral level and the support from fiscal policy wanes. The
c
ti
s unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3½ percent in 2020 toward its
e
m
assumed natural rate in subsequent years, and the supply constraints assumed
o
D
in the medium-term projection diminish.
• PCE price inflation is 2.1 percent in 2022 and 2023 before edging back down
to the Committee’s long-run objective in later years.
• With output materially above its potential level and inflation slightly above
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to
about 5 percent at the end of 2021—2½ percentage points higher than its
assumed long-run value. Thereafter, the federal funds rate moves gradually
back toward its long-run value.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The pace of economic expansion abroad appears to have moderated in the second
quarter, but it remains solid. As we had expected, growth in the emerging market
economies (EMEs) slowed from an unusually strong start of the year, and growth in the
advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rebounded from a temporary dip in the first quarter.
With the slowdown in the EMEs more than offsetting the rebound in the AFEs, we
estimate that total foreign growth slowed to 2½ percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter from a robust 3¼ percent pace in the first. This moderation is a bit more
k
o
pronounced than projected in the June Tealbook, as weaker-than-expected data led to o
l
t
u
downward revisions in Brazil, the euro area, and Mexico, which more than offset upward
O
&
revisions in some emerging Asian economies.

Although we have repeatedly marked down the current year’s forecast in recent
n
o
Tealbooks, the revisions have been fairly small and our outlook remains cautiously c
E
upbeat. Accommodative monetary policy in the AFEs, relatively strong performance of ’ l

n
I
the Chinese economy despite some moderation, and robust U.S. demand should continue
to support the expansion of the foreign economies. Some of the recent data––such as a
pickup of Asian exports and still-elevated levels of PMIs in the AFEs––buttress our
conviction around the forecast. In addition, as discussed in the box “Yield Curve
Inversions and Economic Recessions Abroad,” we take little signal from the flattening of
yield curves in several major AFEs. All told, we expect growth abroad to edge up to
2¾ percent, near its potential pace, in the second half of this year and to stay there
through 2020.
Our baseline outlook calls for solid foreign growth in the years ahead, but
downside risks remain prominent. First, heightened market focus on existing EME
vulnerabilities amid rising global interest rates and mounting concerns about trade policy
could lead to a sharp deterioration of financial conditions and economic activity in many
emerging economies. Second, as highlighted in July’s QS (quantitative surveillance)
assessment of financial stability, adverse developments in China could—given the
economy’s financial vulnerabilities—snowball into a substantial slowdown in Chinese
growth and have sizable international spillovers. We explore such a possibility in the
“Financial Stress in China” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
Third, ongoing trade tensions could lead to much more widespread and sustained

Yield Curve Inversions and Economic Recessions Abroad
As in the United States, long‐term spreads have been trending down in several major advanced
foreign economies (AFEs). Indeed, long‐term spreads in Canada and the United Kingdom, in a
range of 20 to 50 basis points, are similar to those in the United States (figure 1). The box “Don’t
Fear the Long‐Term Spread” in the Financial Market Developments section of the June 2018
Tealbook investigated how well near‐ and long‐term spreads predicted recessions in the United
States. Are yield curve inversions as consistent a predictor of recessions in AFEs as they are in the
United States? The evidence is mixed.
On the one hand, the evidence for AFEs in general is less convincing, especially in recent decades.
kk The AFEs have had many episodes of inverted yield curves over the past six decades (table 1). But
oo
oo the association between inversion episodes (defined as negative spreads between 10‐year and
ll
tt
uu 3‐month rates lasting at least six months) and economic recessions is much weaker for AFEs than
OO
for the United States.1 While all U.S. inversion episodes except one were followed by a recession,
&&
ll most AFE episodes were not. Moreover, the association of inversions and recessions for AFEs,
ee
vv
ee unlike for the United States, has weakened in recent decades. In the AFEs, recessions followed
DD
about one‐half of the inversion episodes before 1990 but only one‐fifth of episodes since.

1 In earlier decades, inflation expectations in most AFEs were poorly anchored, and attempts by foreign
central banks to subdue inflation often resulted in recession. By contrast, in recent decades, inflation
expectations have been much better anchored, obviating drastic monetary policy tightenings.

On the other hand, while the evidence for AFEs as a group is limited, the relationship between
inversion episodes and recessions is stronger for some major AFEs. The left‐hand side of table 2
reports results of regressions of the probability of transitioning into a recession over the next
12 months conditional on a 12‐month lag of a long‐term spread (a spread of 10‐year over 2‐year
yields). For the AFEs in total, long‐term spreads are very weak predictors of recession, especially
in recent decades, but the results for Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom show a
statistical relationship slightly weaker than that for the United States. The right‐hand side looks
at the same analysis for a 2‐year spread (a spread of 2‐year over 3‐month yields). (Note that
because of data limitations, we cannot look at the same near‐term spreads as in the June
Tealbook box.) Here the results tell a similar story, with a stronger relationship for major AFEs
than for AFEs in aggregate.2
k
Although the predictive power of inversions is stronger in major AFEs than for AFEs more o
o
generally, based on our 1980–2018 estimates, the probability of recession in the three AFEs t l
u
implied by long‐term spreads has risen but remains very low (figure 2). Moreover, with monetary O

the likelihood of an inversion is lower. v

2 Because we use the 2‐year spread instead of the June Tealbook box’s near‐term spread (the difference
between the 5‐quarter‐ahead and 1‐quarter‐ahead forward interest rates), our results for the United States
suggest that the shorter‐term spread has a weaker predictive power than the long‐term spreads.

increases in trade barriers than in our baseline, which incorporates only measures already
implemented. The consequences of this possibility are discussed in the “Higher Trade
Barriers” alternative scenario.
Recent data on foreign inflation have generally been lower than expected, and
inflation pressures in many foreign economies have remained relatively subdued. Of
note, second-quarter core inflation ticked down to 1.2 percent in the euro area and
declined to negative 0.9 percent in Japan. With inflation expected to remain well below
target over the next few years, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) are assumed to maintain a highly accommodative monetary stance, with the first
k
o policy rate hikes coming only in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the ECB and late 2020 for
o
l
u t the BOJ. By contrast, with inflation above target in their economies, the Bank of Canada
O
& (BOC) raised its policy rate in July and the Bank of England (BOE) is expected to follow
l
e suit in August. Even so, future policy tightenings by these two central banks are
v
e
D expected to be relatively gradual, especially for the BOE.

E
l Several EME central banks––including those of India, Indonesia, Mexico, and the
’
t
n
I Philippines––recently increased their policy rates in response to rising inflationary
pressures, capital outflows, and currency depreciation. We expect more EME central
banks to tighten monetary policy; in some cases––such as the Bank of Korea––this
tightening is to normalize still-accommodative stances. By contrast, the People’s Bank of
China (PBOC) eased its policy stance amid some slowdown in domestic demand, and we
assume further easing before year-end.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Canada. Recent indicators, such as monthly GDP for April and manufacturing PMI
through June, suggest that real GDP growth rebounded to 2½ percent in the second
quarter from 1.3 percent in the first. With underlying momentum relatively strong,
we expect growth to average 2¼ percent through early 2019 before edging down to
1¾ percent (our estimate of potential growth) in 2020.
Despite a substantial rise in gasoline prices, inflation slowed to 1 percent in the
second quarter from 3.6 percent in the first, mainly reflecting falling prices in a few
core components, such as telephone services and computers. Amid reports of rising
input costs and solid wage growth, we expect inflation to bounce back to 2¾ percent
this quarter before slowing to 2 percent by mid-2019. Citing its solid outlook for both

economic growth and inflation, the BOC raised its policy rate 25 basis points to
1.5 percent on July 11. As resource utilization continues to increase, the BOC is
expected to raise its policy rate further, to 3 percent by mid-2020.
 Japan. Following a weather-related 0.6 percent contraction in the first quarter, recent
indicators—such as PMIs, machinery orders, and real private consumption—suggest
a rebound in real GDP growth to 1½ percent in the second quarter. Growth should
edge down to 1 percent in the second half of 2018, supported by continued highly
accommodative monetary policy. After that, growth should settle near its potential
rate of ¾ percent except for large swings in the second half of 2019 induced by the
k
consumption tax hike planned for October of that year. o
o
l
t
u
Inflation plummeted from 2.5 percent in the first quarter to negative 2.3 percent in the O
&
second, as food prices retraced their previous weather-related gains and core l
e
v
consumer prices fell following an appreciation of the yen earlier this year. As these e
D
n
factors wane, inflation should turn positive in the second half of 2018 and settle near o
c
E
1 percent though 2020, as persistently tight resource utilization eventually pushes up
l
’
t
inflation expectations. With inflation remaining well below target, we expect the n
I
BOJ to maintain a highly accommodative stance, keeping the deposit rate at negative
0.1 percent throughout the forecast period and raising the 10-year yield target above
zero only late in 2020.
 United Kingdom. We estimate that real GDP growth picked up to 1½ percent (its
potential pace) in the second quarter after a lackluster 0.9 percent rate in the first.
The pickup in growth was mainly due to a rebound in construction and retail sales,
two categories that were affected by cold weather at the start of the year. Going
forward, growth should edge up further to 1¾ percent. This outlook is conditional on
the assumption that the United Kingdom will reach a “soft” Brexit agreement with the
European Union (EU). This scenario appears more likely after the recent proposal of
the U.K. government to set up a free trade area and to continue harmonization with
EU regulations for goods. However, risks of a “harder” Brexit remain. The new
proposal led to fierce political debate within the U.K. parliament, and many elements
in the U.K. proposal, especially the U.K. solution to the Irish border problem, do not
meet key EU demands.
Inflation fell from 2.5 percent in the first quarter to 1.8 percent in the second,
½ percentage point lower than forecast in the June Tealbook, as a result of lower
Page 43 of 122

--- Page 47 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2018
retail energy prices and unexpected sharp declines of certain core prices. As these
temporary factors abate, we project inflation to bounce back later this year before
falling to the BOE’s 2 percent target by the end of 2020. In line with the pickup in
economic activity and recent BOE communication, we expect the BOE to increase
the Bank Rate from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent at its August meeting. Thereafter, our
projected policy path envisages gradual rate hikes to 1.5 percent by the end of the
forecast period. Given that the BOE announced in its June policy statement that it
“intends not to reduce the stock of purchased assets until Bank Rate reaches around
1.5 percent,” we continue to assume that the BOE will not begin reducing the size of
its balance sheet until after 2020.
kk
oo
oo
tt ll  Euro area. In contrast to the other AFEs, incoming data for the euro area, such as
uu
OO
&& industrial production through May, suggest that the region’s slowdown in the first
ll
ee quarter was not transitory. Accordingly, we estimate that GDP growth will remain
vv
ee
DD around 1½ percent in the second quarter, ½ percentage point lower than projected in
nn
oo
June. Growth should remain near 1½ percent through 2020, as accommodative
cc
EE
’’ ll monetary policy roughly offsets the drag from the projected financial turmoil
tt
nn
II emanating out of Italy. Admittedly, market sentiment toward Italy has improved a
bit, in part after the country’s finance minister vowed to not widen, at least in the near
term, the budget deficit. But we continue to believe that tensions with euro-area
partners and institutions will eventually escalate.
A surge in retail energy prices boosted headline inflation to 2.2 percent in the second
quarter, just as expected in the June Tealbook, even as core inflation inched down to
1.2 percent. We expect headline inflation to decline to 1½ percent later this year, as
energy prices stabilize, and to slowly edge up thereafter, as resource slack is
gradually eliminated. In line with recent communications, we continue to assume that
the ECB will cease net asset purchases by year-end. We also expect the ECB to
increase its deposit rate from negative 0.4 percent to negative 0.25 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2019 and to 0 percent by mid-2020. However, with inflation
projected to rise only to 1¾ percent by end-2020, the ECB could end up pursuing a
more accommodative monetary policy.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Real GDP growth slowed to a still-solid 6.6 percent in the second quarter
from 7.2 percent in the first, just a touch lower than our June Tealbook forecast.
Page 44 of 122

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2018
Although export growth remained robust, the drag on domestic demand from tighter
credit conditions intensified. Infrastructure investment and retail sales slowed
sharply, and the housing market showed signs of cooling. In an indication that
authorities are concerned about the growth outlook, the PBOC announced a cut to the
reserve requirement ratio for most banks by 50 basis points in June, which follows an
earlier cut in April. Despite these moves, we expect credit conditions to remain
relatively tight in the near term, and we see growth falling further to 6¼ percent in the
second half of the year. Thereafter, we expect growth to edge down to 6 percent by
2020, in line with its potential pace.
k
We estimate that the 25 percent tariff on $34 billion of U.S. imports from China, o
o
l
which went into effect in July, will have only a negligible effect on Chinese growth. t
u
O
However, our baseline does not include the more widespread tariff hikes that have
&
l
been recently proposed on Chinese goods and, if enacted, would exert a more e
v
e
material drag on economic activity. D
n
o
c
 Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP growth in the region moderated to E
l
’
t
3¾ percent in the second quarter, down from 5½ percent in the first. The step-down n
I
reflects some payback from unusually strong growth in Hong Kong and Thailand in
the first quarter. Nevertheless, recent indicators of production and exports, on the
whole, expanded at a faster pace than anticipated, and we revised up growth in the
second quarter almost ½ percentage point since the June Tealbook. We expect
growth to hover around 3¾ percent over the forecast period.
 Mexico. We penciled in real GDP growth of 2½ percent for the second quarter, a
sharp deceleration from the outsized 4.6 percent pace in the first quarter. Data
through May suggest that, in the second quarter, exports weakened and construction
activity dropped sharply, the latter likely reflecting the end of reconstruction efforts
that followed last year’s earthquake. Relative to the June Tealbook, we marked down
second-quarter growth, as the payback from the first-quarter surge has been bigger
than anticipated and export data have disappointed. We continue to expect growth to
pick up to 3 percent by early 2019, boosted by past currency depreciation and
diminishing fiscal drag. The election to the presidency of Andrés Manuel López
Obrador (known as AMLO) on July 1 did not alter our outlook, as the electoral
outcome was widely expected. In addition, AMLO and his cabinet appointees
promised to maintain fiscal discipline and respect the autonomy of the central bank,
Page 45 of 122

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) July 20, 2018
although the possibility remains that the new administration could backtrack on these
promises and reverse past reforms.
After falling sharply in the beginning of the year, 12-month headline inflation has
hovered around 4½ percent in recent months, pressured most recently by hikes in
administered fuel prices. We expect these pressures to wane and inflation to decline
toward the 3 percent target. The Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate 25 basis points
to 7.75 percent, citing concerns about inflationary pressures from past peso
depreciation and tight labor markets.
kk  Brazil. The May national truckers’ strike paralyzed economic activity, throwing yet
oo
oo
ll another wrench into the country’s painfully slow recovery from its deepest recession
tt
uu
OO on record. Of note, industrial production plunged more than 10 percent in May.
&&
ll Although preliminary data for June suggest that activity is recovering, we see real
ee
vv
ee GDP contracting 1½ percent in the second quarter, 3 percentage points below the
DD
nn
June Tealbook forecast, before bouncing back in the third. Thereafter, we expect a
oo
cc
EE
slow recovery as policymakers struggle to address the country’s serious fiscal
ll
’’
tt
nn imbalances and other economic problems.
II
Inflation jumped in June, boosted by soaring food prices during the truckers’ strike.
As a result, we expect quarterly inflation to reach 5½ percent in the third quarter. As
this temporary boost wanes, inflation should decline to 4¼ percent amid considerable
resource slack. In late June, the authorities announced their intention to lower
inflation to 3.75 percent by 2021 from a target of 4.5 percent for this year.
 Argentina. In June, the government reached an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund for a 36-month Stand-By Arrangement, which will provide up to
$50 billion in financing. Under the agreement, Argentina will pursue aggressive
fiscal consolidation and grant more autonomy to the central bank. We expect
economic activity to be very weak, with real GDP contracting 1¼ percent in 2018.
Thereafter, the pace of economic activity should pick up in line with the projected
improvement in financial conditions, but Argentina’s macroeconomic adjustment
process could be far more prolonged and costly.
 Turkey. President Erdogan won general elections in late June, consolidating his
power and clearing the way for a more autocratic rule. Erdogan also gained the
power to appoint the governor and other key officials of the country’s central bank,
Page 46 of 122

raising concerns over the independence of the institution. Indeed, Erdogan’s recent
call for a policy rate cut was followed by sharp falls in equity prices and the value of
the lira as well as by increases in bond yields. Investors have also focused on
Turkey’s struggles to fund its current account deficit and its maturing foreign
currency debt.

Financial Market Developments
Concerns regarding international trade policy weighed on market sentiment over
the intermeeting period, prompting notable declines in some foreign equity markets but
leaving only a modest imprint on domestic asset prices on net. Meanwhile, FOMC
communications were viewed by market participants as slightly less accommodative than
had been expected, and domestic economic data releases were seen as mixed. On
balance, market-based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate through the
end of 2019 were little changed, and expectations only edged down at more distant
horizons. Yields on medium- and long-term nominal Treasury securities also declined a
bit. The broad dollar index moved up.
 The following are according to market quotes:
An increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is not expected at
o
the August FOMC meeting.
The next likely increase is at the September meeting, with a probability of
o
close to 80 percent.
Based on a straight read of market quotes, either one or two 25 basis point
o
increases in the target range are expected between now and the end of the
year; however, adjusting for estimated term premiums using a staff model
s
t
suggests that expectations are more firmly centered on two increases. e
k
r
a
 Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities increased 4 basis points, while M
l
a
5- and 10-year yields declined 7 basis points and 12 basis points, respectively. ci
n
Real yields decreased in line with their nominal counterparts, leaving market- a
n
Fi
based measures of inflation compensation little changed.
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes and option-implied equity market volatility as
measured by the VIX were about unchanged on net.
 Driven in part by trade policy developments, the broad dollar index increased
1.5 percent during the intermeeting period. Most notably, the Chinese
renminbi depreciated almost 6 percent against the dollar as weak Chinese
economic data along with trade policy concerns weighed on the currency.
AFE equity indexes generally declined modestly, while EME equity indexes
are notably lower, led by decreases in Chinese and other Asian equity
markets.

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
Although the reactions of asset prices to FOMC communications during the
period were generally modest, market participants reportedly interpreted the June FOMC
statement and SEP as somewhat less accommodative than had been expected. In arriving
at this interpretation, market participants pointed to the removal of the passages in the
statement that “market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low” and that
the Committee “will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments
relative to its symmetric inflation goal,” as well as to the removal of the guidance that the
federal funds rate would remain below its longer-run level “for some time.” The upward
revisions to the Committee’s median projections for the federal funds rate at the end of
2018 and 2019 were also interpreted by some observers as indicating less accommodation
going forward than had been previously expected. Market participants reportedly
interpreted the Monetary Policy Report and the Chairman’s testimony as generally in line
with recent FOMC communications; asset prices were little changed following the
release of the testimony and throughout the Q&A sessions. Late in the period, Treasury
yields moved a little lower following comments by President Trump expressing concerns
about the firming in the stance of monetary policy over recent months.
Macroeconomic developments led to slight downward pressure on measures of
monetary policy expectations and Treasury yields, on balance, during the intermeeting
period. Concerns about the effects of trade tensions on macroeconomic activity appeared s
t
e
to push rates down at times. Interest rates also fell slightly, on net, in response to k

domestic economic data releases over the intermeeting period.

A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts implies that market a
n
participants place very little probability on a 25 basis point rate increase at the August
Fi
meeting and put the probability that the next rate hike will occur in September at around
80 percent. The path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS contracts and unadjusted
for term premiums suggests that investors expect about 35 basis points of further
tightening between now and the end of this year. A staff model that adjusts for term
premiums implies that two further 25 basis point increases are expected over the same
period. Both the adjusted and unadjusted expected paths of the federal funds rate beyond
the end of 2019 edged down, on net, over the intermeeting period.
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened slightly, on net, since the June FOMC
meeting, with 2-year yields increasing 4 basis points and 10-year yields decreasing

12 basis points. Staff term structure models attributed about three-fourths of the declines
in longer-term Treasury yields to lower term premiums, with the remainder
corresponding to a lower expected path for short-term interest rates. TIPS yields declined
in line with their nominal counterparts, so TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation were little changed on net.
With the most recent flattening of the yield curve, the spread between the 10- and
2-year Treasury yields—a much discussed leading indicator of recessions—now stands
near the 25th percentile of its distribution since 1971. In contrast, the near-term forward
spread, an alternative measure introduced in a recent Tealbook box, was little changed
over the intermeeting period and stands near the 40th percentile of its distribution since
1971.1
Regarding the prices of corporate assets, concerns about international trade
disputes led to a slight decline in sentiment toward some domestic risky assets early in
the period but had a limited marketwide effect, on net, since the June FOMC meeting.
While broad U.S. equity price indexes were little changed, stock prices in the sectors that
are more sensitive to international trade, such as autos and industrials, decreased
moderately. In contrast, stock prices for sectors that benefit from a decline in interest
rates, such as utilities, rose some. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the
one-month horizon (the VIX) was little changed, on net, and remained only a bit above
the very low levels that prevailed before early February. s

sentiment during the intermeeting period. Foreign equity indexes and long-term
sovereign yields generally declined, while the broad dollar index moved up.
Broad equity price indexes in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) were down
modestly, while emerging market economy (EME) equity prices were lower by about
5¼ percent, led largely by an almost 10 percent decline in Chinese equity prices.
Additionally, outflows from EME-focused mutual funds accelerated in June, posting a
second monthly decline following a year of strong inflows. However, there are some
indications that the upswing in EME financial stresses observed in recent months may be
stabilizing: The pace of outflows has slowed so far in July, and EME sovereign bond
spreads narrowed slightly in the intermeeting period.
The dollar appreciated broadly against AFE and EME currencies, with the notable
exception of the Mexican peso. Trade developments were associated with an unusually
sharp depreciation of the Chinese renminbi, which declined almost 6 percent against the
dollar, the largest intermeeting move in decades. Weak data in Europe, dovish
communications by the European Central Bank (ECB), and continued uncertainty over
Brexit weighed on European currencies. Conversely, the elections in Mexico marked the
passage of a risk event, and subsequent remarks by the president-elect seemed to ease
concerns around fiscal discipline and central bank independence in Mexico; these
developments contributed to an 8 percent appreciation of the Mexican peso against the
dollar. Late in the period, comments by President Trump expressing concerns about the s
t
e
k
firming in the stance of monetary policy led the dollar to weaken slightly. r
a

AFE bond yields declined noticeably over the period. In June, the ECB ci
n
announced its intention to wind down its asset purchase program by the end of the year, a
n
Fi
consistent with market expectations. However, the ECB also indicated that policy rates
would remain unchanged through at least the summer of 2019. This guidance was
viewed as more accommodative than expected and led to a moderate decline in the
market-based policy path and German sovereign yields. The Bank of England held its
policy rate steady, but interest rates declined amid ongoing Brexit-related concerns and
lower-than-expected inflation data.

typical levels. After the June FOMC meeting, the effective federal funds rate rose
20 basis points, in line with the increase in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate,
and traded well within the target range throughout the period. (For a discussion of the
mid-June movements, see the FOMC memo “Developments in the Federal Funds Market
Following the Technical Adjustment to IOER.”)
Because elevated rates on other short-term investments offered an attractive
alternative for market participants, take-up at the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP facility
remained low, averaging about $6 billion per day excluding quarter-end.2
On the June quarter-end, rates and volumes in overnight fed funds and Eurodollar
markets were little changed, similar to the March quarter-end, while changes in rates and
volumes in repo markets were more pronounced. In particular, repo rates rose noticeably
and ON RRP take-up increased sharply, albeit to levels far below those seen before 2018.
These effects retraced within a few days, as is typical.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Accommodative credit supply conditions coupled with optimism about the
economic outlook—particularly in the business sector—spurred strong funding flows for
businesses and more moderate flows for households in the second quarter despite rising
financing costs. Consistent with the upbeat outlook in the business sector, M&A activity
has been elevated in recent months. Meanwhile, the repatriation of cash held at foreign
subsidiaries in the aftermath of recent tax reforms led completed corporate share
repurchases to reach a record high in the first quarter, with announced repurchases in the
second quarter forecasting a potential new high. Recent increases in trade tensions
appear to have left little to no imprint to date on indicators of financing conditions.
• Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans, as well as banks’
extensions of C&I loans, remained strong in the second quarter amid rising
interest rate spreads. Much of the new debt financing was reportedly
earmarked for M&A activity. Responses to the July 2018 SLOOS indicated a
net easing of standards on C&I loans by banks.
• Small business lending activity has picked up in recent months. High levels
of optimism among small business owners suggest a continued strengthening
of credit demand.
• Mortgage credit has remained widely available to most borrowers. For
borrowers with low credit scores, lending conditions have continued to ease in
recent months, although conditions remained relatively tight overall. Growth
of home-purchase mortgages has slowed and refinancing activity has
remained quite light, reflecting the rise in mortgage rates and, for purchase
loans, a limited supply of houses for sale.
• Consumer credit activity picked up in May after expanding at a more
moderate rate earlier in the year, with surveys suggesting that households n s
o
think that financing conditions overall will remain favorable for spending on ti
di
n
durable goods. Respondents to the July SLOOS indicated that banks had o
C
recently eased lending standards for auto loans but continued to tighten them g
n
for credit card accounts, particularly for subprime borrowers.

BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained favorable over the
intermeeting period. Despite increases in spreads on corporate bonds and institutional
leveraged loans, gross issuance across both sectors picked up in May and remained strong
in June, with the rise in corporate bond issuance concentrated in the investment-grade
segment of the market. Similarly, growth of C&I loans held by banks was strong on
average. Market participants in all three sectors reported that a large portion of the
proceeds was used to finance M&A activity, with several large deals completed recently.
Responses to the July 2018 SLOOS indicated that, on net, banks had eased
standards and terms on C&I loans in the second quarter, with many citing increased
competition from other lenders and increased ease of transacting in the secondary market
for these loans as reasons for doing so. The current level of banks’ standards on large
C&I loans was reported to be easier than the midpoint of the range of standards that
prevailed between 2005 and the present, with nearly 20 percent of banks on a weighted
basis reporting that standards for syndicated non-investment-grade loans are the easiest
that they have been since 2005. Borrower demand for C&I loans in the second quarter
was reportedly little changed on balance; however, of the banks in the July survey
reporting stronger demand, financing needs for M&A activity was one of the most cited
factors behind the increase.
The volumes of equity issuance through initial public and seasoned offerings were
both robust in June and higher than their paces over the past few months. Meanwhile,
completed stock repurchases in the first quarter totaled their highest dollar value on
record. Announced stock repurchases were also robust in the first quarter and hit a record
high in the second quarter. As described in the box “U.S. Corporations’ Repatriation of
Offshore Profits,” this increase in share repurchases was partly driven by firms
responding to last year’s changes to the tax law by repatriating cash held at foreign
subsidiaries.

U.S. Corporations’ Repatriation of Offshore Profits
Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), foreign profits of U.S. multinational enterprises
(MNEs) were subject to U.S. taxes, but only when repatriated. This system incentivized firms to
keep profits abroad, and, by the end of 2017, U.S. MNEs had accumulated approximately
$1 trillion in offshore profits, held mostly in U.S. fixed-income securities.1 The TCJA imposed a
one-time tax (payable over eight years) on the existing stock of offshore holdings regardless of
whether the funds are repatriated, thus eliminating the tax incentive to keep cash abroad.
Balance of payments data show that U.S. firms repatriated over $300 billion in 2018:Q1, roughly
30 percent of the estimated stock of offshore cash holdings.2
The quantity of cash repatriated might have a notable effect on firm financing patterns and
investment decisions in the near term—a topic that has garnered considerable investor
attention.3 The analysis detailed here shows that funds repatriated in 2018:Q1 have mostly been
used for share buybacks, while it is likely too early to detect any effect on investment.
Our analysis investigates how U.S. nonfinancial firms with large holdings of cash abroad—
specifically the top 15 holders—have deployed these funds, comparing their financing and
investment behavior with that of all other nonfinancial S&P 500 firms.4 Figure 1 shows that,
following the passage of the TCJA, share buybacks spiked dramatically for the top 15, with the
ratio of buybacks to assets more than doubling in 2018:Q1. In dollar terms, buybacks increased
from $23 billion in 2017:Q4 to $55 billion in 2018:Q1.5 Among the top 15, the largest holders
account for the bulk of the share repurchases: In 2018:Q1, the top 5 firms account for
66 percent, and the top holder accounts for 41 percent.
In contrast, the evidence of an analogous increase in investment is limited at this early stage
(figure 2). While there is a seasonal pattern in capital expenditures and R&D—with spikes in the
fourth quarter—the top 15 have been on a slight upward trajectory relative to other firms for a
few years, and there does not appear to be an obvious additional boost following the TCJA. The
upward trend is consistent with the notion that, because the top 15 are large firms, they are
1 Cash held abroad is calculated by Board staff based on Bloomberg data for nonfinancial S&P 500 firms.
Estimates suggest that most of the cash held abroad is invested in dollar-denominated fixed-income assets (see
Zoltan Pozsar (2018), “Repatriation, the Echo-Taper and the €/$ Basis,” Global Money Notes #11 (New
York: Credit Suisse, January)).
2 Repatriation reflects the transfer of funds to the United States in purely accounting terms: The funds
previously held by a foreign affiliate are now held by the U.S. parent. For reference, the 2004 tax holiday, which
provided a temporary one-year reduction in the repatriation tax rate, resulted in $312 billion repatriated, of an
estimated $750 billion held abroad.
3 Under the pre-TCJA regime, using offshore funds for domestic investment or shareholder payouts would
have been deemed a repatriation and thus subject to U.S. taxes.
4 The top 15 firms account for roughly 80 percent of total offshore cash holdings, and roughly 80 percent of
their total cash (domestic plus foreign) is held abroad.
5 Firms can also pay out cash to shareholders through dividends; however, unlike buybacks, dividends were
little changed for the top 15 relative to the same period last year. Similarly, the evidence suggests that most of
the repatriated funds during the 2004 tax holiday were used to fund share buybacks (see Dhammika
Dharmapala, C. Fritz Foley, and Kristin J. Forbes (2011), “Watch What I Do, Not What I Say: The Unintended
Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act,” Journal of Finance, vol. 66 (June), pp. 753–87.).

unlikely to have faced notable constraints or costs to accessing capital markets to fund
investment before the TCJA. Any boost to investment due to tax reform may also take time to
materialize.
How have the top 15 funded their increase in share buybacks? Given that most of the offshore
funds are invested in U.S. fixed-income securities, one might expect some of these to have been
sold to pay for the buybacks. The evidence supports this conclusion: Figure 3 plots the net
purchase of securities (scaled by assets), and indeed the top 15 were net sellers in 2018:Q1, with
their total securities holdings falling by about 3 percent of their total assets (or $66 billion).6
The sale of securities following repatriation may also have been used to pay down debt;
however, the aggregate debt of the top 15 declined only about $15 billion, or 2 percent of their
total debt outstanding, suggesting limited paydowns so far. Consequently, figure 4 shows that
the debt-to-assets ratio of the top 15 was little changed in 2018:Q1 (remaining at 32 percent).7

merger with Time Warner. However, leverage ratios for the sector as a whole, although
near multidecade highs, were little changed, and the outlook for corporate earnings
remained highly favorable, with Wall Street analysts maintaining their projections for
strong growth in earnings per share for S&P 500 firms for the rest of the year.
Small Businesses
Financing conditions for small businesses remained solid over the intermeeting
period. Indicators of recent loan performance remained strong, and credit quality
concerns are not expected to be a significant factor limiting the ability of small businesses
to obtain credit in the near term.
Small business lending activity continued to pick up in recent months. Loan
originations, as measured by the three-month moving average of the Thomson
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index, have shown solid gains. Although the
demand for credit by small businesses is still weak relative to pre-crisis levels, small
business owners appear optimistic about the economy: The National Federation of
Independent Business (NFIB) optimism index has trended up in recent months and now
stands above its pre-crisis level. In addition, both the share of NFIB respondents who
feel that the next three months are a good time to expand and the share who are planning
a capital expenditure in the next three to six months are at post-crisis highs. These facts
suggest a further strengthening of small business credit demand in coming months.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained accommodative.
CRE loans at banks maintained solid growth over the past several months and quarters,
with growth balanced across all three major CRE loan categories. On a weighted basis
across all major CRE loan categories, banks reported that standards and demand for CRE
loans remained unchanged on the whole over the second quarter. However, demand
reportedly weakened further for construction and land development loans, while
standards for these types of loans were tighter than the midpoint of the range that
prevailed between 2005 and the present. Interest rate spreads on commercial mortgage-

MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on
balance, over the intermeeting period. Gross issuance of bonds by state and local
governments in June was robust, continuing to increase from its slow start to the year. In
particular, new capital issuance was at its highest pace in the past two years. Since the
previous FOMC meeting, yields on general obligation bonds remained unchanged on net,
while comparable-maturity Treasury yields declined, resulting in slightly increased
yield spreads.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative
for most borrowers. For borrowers with low credit scores, credit conditions continued to
ease but remained tight overall. The maximum ratio of debt payments to income for
some low credit score borrowers has increased notably over the past year, consistent with
industry anecdotes that lenders are increasingly comfortable expanding their underwriting
parameters. Nonetheless, the volume of mortgages extended to borrowers with low credit
scores has remained subdued in the latest available data.
Interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages have declined slightly since the
June FOMC meeting, roughly in line with yields on agency MBS, although rates
remained near their highest levels since 2011. As a result, mortgage refinancing activity
continued to be muted and growth of purchase mortgage originations has slowed over the
past year. The tight inventory of homes for sale also appeared to be weighing on the
volume of purchase originations.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of
growth in spending. Growth of consumer credit picked up in May from the more
moderate pace seen earlier this year. Despite rising interest rates, recent household s
n
o
surveys have indicated that consumers’ assessments of buying conditions for autos and ti

other expensive durable goods were generally positive, in part because financing rates n

Credit supply conditions have also remained largely supportive. A moderate net
fraction of July SLOOS respondents reported easing standards on auto loans over the
previous three months after several quarters of banks reporting tightening standards.
However, a significant net fraction of banks reportedly continued to tighten standards for
credit card accounts. On net, banks reported that the current levels of standards for both
prime auto and credit card loans were broadly the same as the midpoint of the range of
standards that prevailed between 2005 and the present. Banks’ reports of tight
standards—relative to this benchmark—were primarily confined to subprime-rated
borrowers, who have typically accounted for less than 20 percent of new credit
extensions in the auto and credit card loan markets in recent years.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
&
s
k
As in the June Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic s
Ri
activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by the
FOMC. We also judge the risks around our projections for real GDP growth and the
unemployment rate as being balanced. These assessments are consistent with the estimates
presented in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk.” On the upside, the underlying
fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain strong—bolstered in part
by the tax cuts enacted last year—and readings on household and business sentiment generally
continue to be upbeat. Against this economic backdrop, spending and investment could expand
faster than in the staff projection. On the downside, trade policies could move in a direction that
ultimately has significant negative effects on economic growth. Another possibility is that the
recent fiscal policy actions could produce less of a boost to aggregate demand than assumed in
the baseline projection, as the current tightness of resource utilization may result in smaller
multiplier effects than would be typical at other points in the business cycle.
Although we have left our assessment of risks around economic activity unchanged, we
continue to wrestle with some aspects of that assessment. For instance, the box “Alternative
View: Supply Constraints Will Prevent the Unemployment Rate from Falling Much Further”
suggests that risks may be skewed to the upside for the unemployment rate forecast. More
generally, the staff is not good at forecasting recessions, which historically have generated sharp
increases in the unemployment rate and declines in real GDP.
With regard to inflation, we still see average uncertainty and balanced risks around our
projection. To the downside, longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price
setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming
years. To the upside, with economic activity projected to move further above its potential,
inflation could increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models
that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation. These assessments are
consistent with the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which judges the overall financial vulnerabilities in

k
s
Ri prime-rated borrowers, but borrowing by highly levered and lower rated firms is elevated,
suggesting that a weakening in economic activity could be amplified by strains within the
corporate sector. Asset valuation pressures remain broad based, with prices relative to
fundamentals in the upper portion of their historical range across markets for equities, corporate
bonds, leveraged loans, and commercial real estate. Moreover, house prices have accelerated
this year, and a variety of measures now point to somewhat elevated valuation pressures in this
market, with particularly pronounced pressures evident in some regions. Existing domestic
financial vulnerabilities could amplify shocks from a marked jump in U.S. Treasury yields
caused by an increase in concerns about the current high level and unsustainable trajectory for
U.S. federal government debt, or from abroad, including from financial turbulence in China.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline
projection using simulations of staff models. In the first scenario, the central bank misinterprets
the persistently high level of labor utilization shown in the baseline as indicating a lower natural
rate of unemployment than is actually the case, and this misperception exacerbates the
undershooting of the unemployment rate. By contrast, in the second scenario, the strong level of
economic activity in the baseline raises the level of potential labor inputs and lowers the true
natural rate, a development recognized by policymakers. The third scenario posits that increases
in interest rates restrain household and business spending by more than assumed in the staff
projection. The fourth scenario considers a downside risk from developments related to fiscal
policy—in particular, a faster increase in term premiums over the next few years, which leads to
higher borrowing rates for households and businesses, and a drop in federal spending beginning
in 2020. The fifth scenario traces out the consequences of a sizable increase in financial market
stress in China. Finally, the sixth scenario illustrates the effects of widespread increases in trade
barriers that significantly reduce world trade and output.

Misperceived Natural Rate [FRB/US] s
Ri
The Tealbook projection shows further declines in the unemployment rate to historically
low levels with a protracted period of tight labor utilization and only modest increases in
inflation. In this scenario, we assume that the central bank initially believes the natural rate of
unemployment to be 4.2 percent, 50 basis points below its actual level in the simulation, and that
the persistence of very low unemployment leads the central bank to gradually revise down its
view of the natural rate of unemployment to 3 percent in 2023. Because the central bank
underestimates the intensity of resource utilization, monetary policy is more accommodative than
it would have been, given an accurate reading of the natural rate of unemployment and hence the
output gap. Eventually, however, the central bank recognizes that it is unable to stabilize the
economy at these high levels of activity without persistently exceeding its inflation target and,
over the course of the next decade, corrects its misperception.
As a result of the misperception, the federal funds rate is ¾ percentage point below the
baseline on average from 2020 to 2023. With the resulting additional monetary accommodation,
real GDP grows more quickly than in the baseline forecast and the unemployment rate falls
further, reaching about 2½ percent at the end of 2020 and remaining close to that level for
several years. Inflation rises slowly, but steadily, and reaches 2½ percent by the end of 2023.2
Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]
In this scenario, the very tight labor market in the baseline has persistent positive effects
on the productive capacity of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as “positive
hysteresis.” Specifically, we assume that persistent exposure to a hot economy reduces exits
from the labor force and generates additional entrants, causing the trend labor force participation
1 GEMUS is a two-country open economy DSGE model with relatively standard New Keynesian features
such as sticky prices and financial frictions. The model is a simplified version of SIGMA that is better suited to
analyze trade policy issues.
2 We also considered a version of this model with a Phillips curve slope that is four times steeper than the
baseline specification. In that case, inflation would be 3 percent in 2021; the unemployment rate would bottom out
at around 3¼ percent, and the natural rate would be perceived to have fallen to about 4 percent.

Over the projection period, potential output rises, on average, about ¼ percentage point
more per year than in the baseline. This additional room to grow allows real GDP growth to run
at a similar increment above the baseline. As a result, the output gap is little changed. The
unemployment rate is slightly above the baseline until the first quarter of 2020 because increases
in labor force participation offset the effect of greater gains in employment. After 2020, the
unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory and is about ¼ percentage point below the staff
projection in 2023. With inflation and the output gap close to the baseline, the federal funds rate
is little changed.4
Greater Interest Rate Sensitivity [FRB/US]
The Tealbook baseline forecast shows a large positive output gap for a number of years
despite a rise in the federal funds rate that takes it to about 2½ percentage points above its long-
run value. That outcome is partly attributable to a relatively low interest sensitivity of economic
activity assumed in the staff forecast. In this scenario, we explore the possibility that spending
by both households and firms is more sensitive to interest rates than we have assumed.5
With household spending and business investment more responsive to the path of real
interest rates and the real federal funds rate above its long-run value at the beginning of 2019,
real GDP growth falls below the baseline until the first quarter of 2021. The unemployment rate
declines only a little from its current level and then begins to edge up, reaching 4 percent in
2020, while inflation is close to the baseline, reflecting the very flat Phillips curve in the FRB/US
3 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the natural
rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-generating
components.
4 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential output, the
federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching almost 5¼ percent by the
end of 2021. In that case, the effect of positive hysteresis on the unemployment rate is about half of that shown in
this scenario.
5 The magnitude of the peak output response to a monetary policy shock of 1 percentage point on the
federal funds rate rises from 0.2 percentage point under the baseline to 0.6 percentage point under the higher interest
rate sensitivity calibration, a value similar to the response shown in some DSGE models.

Unexpected Fiscal Restraint [FRB/US]
U
&
s
k
The recent federal budget agreement increased discretionary spending caps by a total of s
Ri
$300 billion for this fiscal year and the next, above the levels set in the Budget Control Act of
2011 (BCA). The baseline projection assumes that spending appropriations will rise with
inflation from that higher level in 2020 and later years. However, this scenario looks at the risk
that appropriations return in 2020 to the much lower levels in the BCA, eventually reducing
federal spending relative to the baseline by about ½ percent of nominal GDP. This event in
isolation would have modest macroeconomic effects, with GDP growth about ¼ percentage point
lower in 2020 and the unemployment rate rising around ¼ percentage point above the baseline
level of 3¾ percent in 2022; inflation is little changed.6
However, macroeconomic outcomes could be worse if the move to a lower path for federal
discretionary spending takes place amid intensifying concerns about the current high level of
federal debt and its unsustainable long-run trajectory.7 Thus, in this scenario, we also assume
that financial market participants begin to demand increasingly higher term premiums on
Treasury securities beginning this year. We further assume that those higher premiums also
show through to higher borrowing rates for both households and businesses, restraining their
spending and investment.
Given both the reduced government expenditures and the higher borrowing costs, real GDP
growth falls ¼ percentage point per year below the baseline, on average, from the second half of
this year through 2022, by which time the unemployment rate has risen ½ percentage point
above the baseline. Inflation remains close to baseline levels, and consequently the federal funds
rate is about 10 basis points lower, on average, over the medium term.8
6 The numbers cited here are not the ones shown in the alternative scenario table or exhibit.
7 The unsustainable trajectory for federal government debt would be little changed by the lower path for
discretionary spending assumed in this scenario.
8 Some research suggests that the multiplier effects of fiscal stimulus might be larger in recessions than
during economic expansions. To illustrate the effect of this possibility, we also ran a model simulation with the
multipliers associated with recent fiscal policy changes reduced by half. Under this specification, GDP growth is
lower than the baseline by about ¼ percentage point per year on average through the end of 2021, at which time the
unemployment rate is just under ½ percentage point higher. With inflation little changed, the federal funds rate is
½ percentage point lower at the end of that year.

t
r
e Although we expect that activity in China will decelerate only modestly over the forecast
c
n
U period, China’s vulnerabilities have increased in recent years amid rising corporate and
&
household debt levels and a still heavily leveraged shadow banking sector. Against this
s
k
s
Ri backdrop, any number of adverse shocks—including a property price bust, run on a shadow
bank, or failure of a major corporation—could cause financial conditions to deteriorate and lead
to a substantial slowdown in Chinese GDP growth. Such developments would likely put
downward pressure on the renminbi and lead to sharply lower commodity prices and sizable
negative spillovers to other emerging market economies (EMEs).
This scenario assumes that such a risk materializes. GDP growth in China and other
EMEs falls to only 4½ percent and 2½ percent, respectively, in 2020 as EME corporate
borrowing spreads increase 175 basis points and confidence declines. The financial turbulence
in EMEs and worries about future growth in global demand trigger a moderate rise in borrowing
spreads in the United States and in the advanced foreign economies. Flight-to-safety flows cause
the dollar to appreciate 5 percent and depress term premiums on U.S. government bonds.
Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central banks are assumed to tighten
monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on inflation arising from the depreciation of their
currencies.
The appreciation of the dollar, weaker foreign activity, and adverse financial spillovers
cause U.S. GDP growth to moderate to about 1½ percent in 2019 and the unemployment rate to
rise to 4 percent in 2020. Lower resource utilization and falling import prices reduce core PCE
inflation to about 1½ percent in 2019. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the
baseline, rising to 4 percent by the end of 2020.
This scenario assumes that the response of the Chinese authorities to the emergence of
financial stresses keeps the fallout relatively contained. The staff’s QS assessment considers an
alternative in which a full-blown crisis in China and the other EMEs ensues that has considerably
more adverse consequences for the United States and the global economy.
Higher Trade Barriers [GEMUS]
The current process of widespread trade negotiations is unprecedented in the post–World
War II period, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. Accordingly, beyond the measures

already implemented, which should have a relatively limited effect on aggregate economic y
t
n
activity, we have not built any additional trade policy actions into our baseline outlook. If the ai
t
r
process ultimately leads to lower trade barriers around the world, there could be significant e
c
n
positive effects on the United States and foreign economies. Conversely, an outcome of U
&
widespread and sustained increases in trade barriers would likely entail profoundly s
k
s
adverse effects. Ri
This scenario considers the latter possibility. In particular, we assume that the United
States increases tariffs on all imported goods by 15 percentage points and that foreign economies
impose a similar sized increase in tariffs on U.S. exports. Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce
imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies have little effect on the
trade balance. However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods depresses household
spending while business spending declines, both as a result of the higher cost of imported capital
goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing spreads to rise. In addition, we
assume that productivity growth slows as a result of a shift in production to less efficient
domestic firms and industries as well as a reduction in international competition that diminishes
incentives to innovate.
All told, these developments push the U.S. economy into a mild recession lasting until
the end of 2019, and the unemployment rate rises to 4½ percent. Higher import prices boost core
PCE inflation to 4¼ percent in the second half of 2018. Given the jump in inflation, the inertial
Taylor rule initially prescribes a steeper rise in the federal funds rate than in the baseline, rising
above 4 percent in early 2019. The federal funds rate moves below the baseline starting in 2020,
as inflation returns close to baseline and output remains well below potential.
We have limited experience with the large and broad-based increases in trade barriers
contemplated in this scenario, and, accordingly, there is unusually large uncertainty around our
estimates. The declines in productivity associated with higher trade barriers could show through
to aggregate output either more slowly or more rapidly than indicated in the simulation. Effects
on confidence or market sentiment could be smaller or larger. And, notably, the simulation does
not take into account hard-to-model features—including disruptions to global supply chains or
the effects of policy uncertainty on business investment—which might have an especially large
effect on economic activity here and abroad.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c
n
U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals Ri s
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y
t intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. The near-term prescriptions are little changed from
those in the June Tealbook. Over the medium term, the Tealbook baseline projection
features modestly higher levels of resource utilization, on average, than the June
projection. Consequently, the prescriptions arising from most of the strategies are
slightly less accommodative than those in the previous Tealbook.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the “balanced
approach” rule), the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and a flexible price-level
targeting (FPLT) rule.1 These near-term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown by the black lines in the middle
panels; the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural
rate of unemployment (not shown) instead of the output gap. The top and middle panels
also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is constructed using
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2
The staff forecast for the variables that enter these rules has changed very little;
consequently, the prescriptions of each of the policy rules are nearly the same as in the
June Tealbook.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline. The near-term prescriptions of the first-
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Starting with
this Tealbook, the equations for the Tealbook baseline policy rule and for all simple rules considered herein
express policy rates on the same 360-day uncompounded basis as the published federal funds rate. In
previous Tealbooks, the rule equations expressed policy rates on a 365-day fully compounded basis. This
technical adjustment has only minor effects on the rules’ prescriptions. For comparability, all previous
Tealbook prescriptions reported herein are adjusted to reflect the new methodology.
2 Except for the first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report
prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the current−Tealbook
value of the lagged policy rate.
2. Starting with this Tealbook, the equations for the Tealbook baseline policy rule and for all simple rules considered herein express policy
rates on the same 360−day uncompounded basis as the published federal funds rate throughout the calculations. For comparability, all
previous Tealbook prescriptions reported herein are adjusted to reflect the new methodology.
3. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the current quarter)
in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the Tealbook or SEP−consistent
projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the June 2018 median SEP responses. The "Average projected real federal funds
rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r*.

difference rule, for which adjustments are gradual, essentially coincide with
those of the Tealbook baseline.
• Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call for raising
the federal funds rate in the near term, the FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate
the cumulative shortfall in the core PCE price index of about 2½ percent,
prescribes levels for the federal funds rate in the third and fourth quarters that
remain below the current target range.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2018 Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP).3 In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used
to generate an estimate of r*.4 This r* concept, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in
the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real
economy; it does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation
objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate.
• At 3.44 percent, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* in this
quarter is 18 basis points above the corresponding value computed using the
June Tealbook projection. The upward revision reflects the fact that, in the
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the June 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth and
monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.
4 The staff has implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model since the
previous Tealbook. With the exception of the SEP-consistent FRB/US r*, all model simulations referenced
herein use the latest version of the model, including simulations based on the previous Tealbook projection.
The elasticities in the new version of the model, such as those governing the response of inflation to
resource utilization and the response of aggregate demand to interest rates, are sufficiently similar to those
in the previous version that the rule prescriptions are largely unaffected by the change of version. The
SEP-consistent FRB/US r* continues to use the previous version of the model because of data
compatibility limitations.

current Tealbook projection, the output gap is slightly more positive by the
end of the 12-quarter period than in the June Tealbook.
• At 1.80 percent, the SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The difference stems from the fact that the
SEP-consistent projection has output exceeding potential by a considerably
smaller amount over the medium term than does the current Tealbook
forecast. This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the
median path for the real federal funds rate implied by SEP projections
averages almost 1 percentage point less than the corresponding path in the
s
e Tealbook.

simulations for each rule are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers commit

• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases ¾ percentage
point over the remainder of this year and rises, on average, 1 percentage point
per year for the following two years, reaching 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter
of 2020.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding
Tealbook baseline values through 2022. This higher path is associated with
only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10-year Treasury yield than in
the baseline until 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter, as the Taylor
(1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate beyond
the period shown. Because wage and price setting today is influenced by
5 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in

expected future outcomes in the FRB/US model, and because the Taylor
(1999) rule calls for somewhat more accommodative policy later in the
simulation, current inflation is somewhat higher than in the baseline
projection. The path for the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook
baseline path over the next few years but subsequently takes a bit longer to
return to its natural rate.6
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate. Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to
output exceeding its assumed potential level over the projection period, the
prescriptions of this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over
the period shown. The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher
than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years, but, starting in the fourth
quarter of 2020, the path for the federal funds rate falls below the baseline
path for a sustained period. As a result, current inflation is higher, and the real
10-year Treasury yield is lower, than their corresponding values in the
Tealbook projection. The more accommodative conditions engender a more
pronounced undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate
during and beyond the medium term.
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first-difference rule is
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through 2020, but runs
below the baseline path for some years thereafter. The latter divergence
occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the decline in the
output gap that is projected beyond 2020. The associated lower path of the
federal funds rate and the expectation of higher inflation in the future imply
lower longer-term real interest rates than in the Tealbook baseline. Thus, the
first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are
6 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this and the Taylor (1993) rule
simulations, despite higher levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption that
price and wage setters perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond
the next several years and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage
setting decisions. The box “Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy
Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results under a scenario in which price and wage
setters lack such a perfect understanding. In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non-inertial
policy rule led to a significant decline in inflation and rise in unemployment at the start of the simulation in
response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than the corresponding
outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection.
• The FPLT rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of core PCE
inflation from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011. The FPLT
rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate below the current target range
until the first quarter of 2020 and maintaining a markedly slower pace of
increases thereafter than in the Tealbook baseline. This prescription generates
a higher rate of inflation in coming years that eventually undoes the
2½ percentage point cumulative shortfall of the core PCE price index relative
to a path that rises 2 percent per year beginning in 2012:Q1. Because the
simulation embeds the assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to
closing this gap over time and that financial market participants, price setters,
and wage setters correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal
funds rates, the path of the real 10-year Treasury rate drops below the
Tealbook baseline for the next five years. The unemployment rate is
substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations
shown, dropping below 2½ percent in 2020.7
• Compared with the June Tealbook, the prescriptions of the simple rules are at
most a couple of tenths of a percentage point higher over the period shown.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.8
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may improve economic outcomes.9
7 The unemployment rate subsequently rises to a level near its natural rate in 2031, while headline
PCE inflation falls from a peak of 2.4 percent in 2023 to 2 percent in 2032.
8 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
9 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

The first three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection, for two reasons. First,
high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up
to its natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the
unemployment rate does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the
FRB/US model. Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood
and fully credible, the front-loading of policy tightening is not disruptive. In practice,
however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as high and as quickly as
prescribed by the first three optimal control policies, macroeconomic outcomes could be
less benign than shown here because of the confusion and financial market disruption that
such an abrupt change in policy might engender. In contrast, the fourth optimal control
policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels last experienced during the
1950s. Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those
predicted by the simulations.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate over the next
several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with
the equal-weights loss function judge to be costly.10 The small projected
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates only
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response of
inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.
• The second simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
10 When we use the June 2018 SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5½ percent, compared
with about 7½ percent under the Tealbook baseline.

identical to that specification. Even though policymakers attach larger losses
to deviations of inflation from 2 percent, they nonetheless choose a federal
funds rate path that results in inflation undershooting the inflation objective by
more than under the baseline policy over the period shown, for two reasons.
First, policymakers seek to undo the modest but persistent overshoot of the
inflation objective over the next decade, which they see as costly. Second,
policymakers continue to attach significant losses to the unemployment rate
undershooting its natural rate. On net, the federal funds rate path is only
modestly less restrictive than under the equal-weights specification.
e s • The third simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
gi
e function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate
t
a
t r but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. This
S
y simulation seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even faster

P
y
r soars to 10 percent at the beginning of next year and then averages around
a
t
e 7 percent from 2020 through 2023.

o
M
• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but the loss
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the
unemployment rate is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of
the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control
simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path
throughout the period shown. With the asymmetric loss function,
policymakers choose this more accommodative path for the policy rate
because their desire to keep inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by an
aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment. The tighter labor
market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent than in the case of equal weights.
Starting in the middle of the 2020s (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a
little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the
inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated
resource utilization.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rule and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a small
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

The first two rules in the table were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price gap like the FPLT rule have
been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 An FPLT rule similar to the one above is
also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and chosen
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objectiv𝐿𝐿e𝐿𝐿 and an equilibrium real

federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent. The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
1 Starting with this Tealbook, the equations for the Tealbook baseline policy rule and for all simple
rules considered herein express policy rates on the same 360-day uncompounded basis as the published
federal funds rate. In previous Tealbooks, the rule equations expressed policy rates on a 365-day fully
compounded basis.

next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.4 The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
3 The staff has implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model since the
previous Tealbook. All model simulations referenced herein use the latest version of the model with the
exception of the SEP-consistent FRB/US r*, which continues to use the previous version of the model
because of data compatibility limitations.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
price inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps

unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate. The optimal control policy and associated
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
