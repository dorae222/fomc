Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook

The economy continues to expand at an above-trend pace. We judge that the D
n
economy is currently operating somewhat above its sustainable level and will move o
c
E
further beyond this level over the medium term; we expect inflation will run close to c
ti
s
2 percent on a sustained basis over the medium term. e

In the labor market, payroll employment gains in April and May averaged
191,000 per month, substantially above the pace we estimate to be consistent with no
change in resource utilization. During the same period, the unemployment rate fell to
3.9 percent in April and then further to 3.8 percent in May after having held steady at
4.1 percent over the previous six months. Meanwhile, the incoming spending data led us
to revise up our projection for real GDP growth in the first half of this year by
½ percentage point to an annual rate of 2¾ percent.
Our projection that the economy will expand at an above-trend pace over the
medium term reflects the influence of expansionary fiscal policy and solid foreign
growth. We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 2¾ percent this year to
1¾ percent in 2020 as monetary policy continues to tighten. The projected average pace
of growth over the next three years is a little less than in the April Tealbook, primarily in
response to the higher exchange value of the dollar in this projection; we have also
assumed that supply constraints will hold back GDP growth a bit more than in the
previous Tealbook. Even so, by the end of the medium term, real output is projected to
be 3 percent above our estimate of its potential. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate
is expected to be 3.4 percent at the end of 2020, 0.1 percentage point higher than in our
previous projection but nonetheless about 1¼ percentage points below our estimate of its
natural rate.
Consumer price inflation has moved up from the low readings seen last year.
Core PCE prices rose 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and we expect the
12-month change to edge up to 2 percent this summer. Core inflation is projected to rise
to 2 percent in 2019 and to 2.1 percent by 2020 as resource utilization tightens further
and underlying inflation inches up. Total PCE prices are expected to increase 2.1 percent
this year, a little more than core prices, boosted by an increase in energy prices. After
this year, total inflation—at 1.9 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020—is restrained a

The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2018 is the same as the projections
n
o
from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus
c
E
and a touch higher than the Blue Chip in 2019. The staff’s unemployment rate forecast
c
s
ti
is 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point below the outside forecasts in both 2018 and 2019. The
e
m staff’s projections for total CPI inflation in 2018 is a touch higher than the outside
o
D forecasts and the same as the outside forecasts for 2019. The staff forecasts for total
and core PCE inflation are the same or lower than the forecasts from the SPF.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
e
D the March FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic
n
o projection with the one we presented in the March Tealbook.
c
E
c Incoming data for GDP growth have been a little stronger than our expectations in the
ti
e s March Tealbook, while data on the labor market have been mixed, with a lower
m
unemployment rate but also slower payroll growth on average. Our projection for real
o
D
activity over the medium term has been revised down, reflecting somewhat weaker financial
conditions (a stronger dollar and lower equity prices) as well as the small rethinks that we
built into the current Tealbook regarding both supply constraints and consumer spending
from the recent tax cuts. Thus, resource utilization, as measured by the unemployment gap
or the output gap, is somewhat less tight in this projection than in the March Tealbook.
Our projection for headline inflation in 2018 is revised up a bit relative to the March
Tealbook, reflecting the rise in oil prices in recent months. We continue to expect core
inflation to edge up in coming years but by slightly less than we projected in March, given
the revisions to resource utilization and the dollar. We now project core inflation to be just
slightly above 2 percent, and headline inflation to be at 2 percent, by 2020.
With the projections for both resource utilization and inflation weaker than in the March
Tealbook, the federal funds rate path from the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our
baseline forecast now rises less steeply than in March.

bit by declining energy prices. Our forecast for total PCE inflation is the same as in the t l

April Tealbook. Finally, as in recent Tealbooks, we have not incorporated any effects on

either real activity or inflation from higher import tariffs.1 e l

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS o
c
E
c
Fiscal Policy ti
s
e
m
• We estimate that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government
o
D
will boost aggregate demand growth ½ percentage point in 2018,
¾ percentage point in 2019, and ½ percentage point in 2020, exclusive of
multiplier effects and offsets from reactions in interest rates and the dollar.
Roughly one-half of that medium-term impetus is due to the recent federal tax
cuts, while about one-fourth reflects the recent federal spending legislation;
most of the remainder is due to projected increases in real state and local
government expenditures.2
• The federal deficit is projected to rise from 3½ percent of GDP in fiscal year
2017 to 5½ percent in fiscal 2020—well above its sustainable level—with this
increase primarily reflecting the effects of the recent tax and spending bills.
We continue to assume that in the longer term, policymakers will enact
o
deficit reduction measures that gradually stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Monetary Policy
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection
calls for the federal funds rate to increase 1¼ percentage points in total this
year and to rise about 1 percentage point per year, on average, over the next
two years, reaching 4½ percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. This trajectory
is slightly flatter than in the April Tealbook, reflecting somewhat lower
1 We estimate that the effects of the steel and aluminum tariffs, in isolation, will be minimal for
both net exports and prices. Other potential tariff changes remain highly uncertain at this point and are
therefore not included in our projection.
2 Under current law, the federal spending caps decline in fiscal year 2020, reverting back to the
levels set in the Budget Control Act of 2011. Since fiscal 2012, however, policymakers have consistently
set actual appropriations above the caps. Consequently, we assume that federal appropriations will remain
constant in real terms in fiscal 2020 rather than falling back to the caps.

Other Interest Rates
• The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly over the medium
term from an average of about 3 percent in the current quarter to 4¼ percent
by the end of 2020. Relative to the April Tealbook, the projected yield
beyond the current quarter is revised down a bit, reflecting the slightly flatter
trajectory for the federal funds rate.
• The 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond yield are also
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term. The mortgage rate path is
revised in line with revisions to the path of the 10-year Treasury yield. Triple-
B corporate bond yields are revised down more than 10-year Treasury yields
because we now judge that the strong economic outlook results in a lower
path for credit spreads than previously assumed.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
• Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter about ½ percent higher
than in the April Tealbook forecast, reflecting recent increases in broad equity
price indexes. Beyond the current quarter, we project stock prices to rise at an
average annual rate of around ¾ percent, similar to our previous projection.
• We expect annual house price growth to slow from 6 percent last year to
5¼ percent this year. The projected growth in house prices this year is
slightly faster than in the April Tealbook, reflecting our response to a strong
first-quarter reading, which suggests the slowdown in house prices we have
been expecting has not yet begun to materialize. Still, we continue to expect
house price increases to moderate to a 3½ percent pace in 2019 and 2020,
reflecting both the projected rise in mortgage rates and our assessment that
house prices are modestly elevated compared with rents.

o
t l Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
u
O
& • Real GDP growth in the foreign economies is estimated to have picked up to
l
e
v an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the first quarter. This reading is a bit faster
e
D
than projected in the April Tealbook, as weaker-than-expected growth in the
n
o
c advanced foreign economies was more than offset by unusually strong growth
E
c in some emerging Asian economies. Growth abroad is projected to moderate
ti
s
e to around 2¾ percent in the second quarter and to remain at roughly that pace
m
o
D over the rest of the forecast period. The rise in financial stresses in Italy due
to political developments, a tightening of financial conditions in some
emerging market economies (EMEs), and—for net oil importers—the increase
in oil prices led us to revise down our forecast a touch. Moreover,
developments in Europe and EMEs have significantly increased downside
risks to our outlook.
• Since the April Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated about
4 percent amid heightened downside risks to foreign growth and increased
safe-haven demand for dollar assets. We expect the broad real dollar to
appreciate at an annual rate of about 1¾ percent through the forecast period as
market expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff
forecast. Reflecting the recent appreciation, the real dollar at the end of the
forecast horizon is about 3¾ percent higher than in the April Tealbook.
Oil and Commodity Prices
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen about $4 per barrel on net since the
April Tealbook, closing May 30, around $78 per barrel. Futures prices for
December 2020 have increased more, rising $7 to roughly $68 per barrel. The
rise in futures prices is consistent with the continued collapse in Venezuelan
oil production and the Administration’s decision to reinstate U.S. sanctions
against Iranian oil exports. Even after incorporating this upward revision to
futures prices, oil prices are expected to decline slowly over the forecast
period, as geopolitical risks stabilize and as supply increases on expected
loosening of OPEC restrictions and surging U.S. shale oil production. (For
further discussion, including a review of the effects of oil prices on U.S.
growth and inflation, see the box “The Recent Rise in Oil Prices.”)

• In contrast to the movements in oil prices, price changes for other t l
u
O
commodities have been muted. Prices for industrial metals are essentially
&
l
unchanged from the April Tealbook, outside of a minor correction in e
v
e
aluminum prices following the relaxation of announced U.S. sanctions on a D
n
large Russian producer. Aluminum prices were little changed following the o
c
E
announcement that temporary exemptions from tariffs would no longer apply c
ti
s
to major trading partners including the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. e
m
o
D
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
Real GDP grew at an estimated annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, and
we project growth to step up to a 3½ percent pace in the current quarter; both figures are
up about ½ percentage point relative to the April Tealbook. We estimate that output
stands nearly 2 percent above its potential level in the current quarter, a bit higher than in
the previous Tealbook. (A new exhibit titled “Cyclical Position of the U.S. Economy:
Near-Term Perspective” shows the judgmental assessment of the output gap as well as an
estimate from a statistical model.) Over the second half of the year, real GDP is expected
to rise at an annual rate of 2¾ percent, a little slower than in the April Tealbook.
• Real PCE is reported to have increased at an annual rate of only 1 percent in
the first quarter. In our assessment, this weakness largely reflected payback
from the exceptionally strong growth in the fourth quarter of last year. PCE
growth is anticipated to step up to a 3 percent pace in the current quarter. We
expect consumer spending to rise at a 2¼ percent pace in the second half of
the year; this projection is revised down slightly from the previous Tealbook
because some of the unexpected second quarter strength in spending was on
energy items, which we think will unwind in the second half. For the year as
a whole, our projection for PCE growth is little revised from the April
Tealbook.
• Business investment is projected to rise at an annual rate of about 7½ percent
in the first half of the year. We expect continued solid gains in coming
quarters, supported by still-favorable financial conditions, elevated business
sentiment and profit expectations, recent tax legislation, and the salutary
effects of high oil prices on activity in the drilling and mining sector.

The Recent Rise in Oil Prices
&
l
e
v Oil prices have increased about 50 percent over the past year, with the spot price
e
D
of Brent crude oil rising from about $50 per barrel to about $75 per barrel
n
o (figure 1). For most of the period, further-dated futures prices remained
c
E
relatively stable, in the range of $55 per barrel; however, since the time of the
c
ti
April Tealbook, futures prices have moved up appreciably, reaching nearly
s
e
m $70 per barrel.
o
D
Both supply and demand factors have contributed to the oil price increase. In
particular, the broad-based improvement in the outlook for the global economy
was a key driver of the price increase in the second half of 2017. In recent
months, supply concerns have become more prevalent, affecting both spot and
further-dated futures prices. Despite sharply rising U.S. production, markets
have been attuned to escalating conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran as well as
the precipitous decline in Venezuelan oil production amid the country’s economic
and political crisis. Prices also increased after President Trump announced on
May 8 that the United States was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and
that sanctions against Iranian oil exports would be reinstated.
We expect oil prices to decline slowly through 2020 as geopolitical risks stabilize
and as supply, including U.S. shale oil production, grows to meet demand. In
addition, higher prices have put pressure on OPEC’s November 2016 agreement
with certain non-OPEC countries to restrain production. A stated aim of the
agreement was to reduce the glut in global inventories, and, in recent months,
inventory levels have fallen rapidly toward long-run averages. In response to
both lower inventories and higher prices, OPEC leaders have recently expressed a
willingness to discuss relaxing the production agreement at their upcoming
meeting in June, reducing some of the upward pressure on prices. That said, we
do think that some of the recent increase in prices is likely to be long lasting, and,
in line with futures prices, we have increased our forecast for the price of oil at
the end of 2020 by about $7 per barrel relative to the April Tealbook.

What is the expected effect of the recent rise in oil prices on the U.S. economy? O
To begin with, higher oil prices are likely to depress consumption. In particular, &
l
the increase in oil prices since last year is estimated to have translated into a e
v
roughly $250 annual increase in expenditures on gasoline for each household, on e
D
average, from about $1850 to $2100. However, as indicated in figure 2, the share n
o
of net oil imports in U.S. GDP has declined substantially as U.S. oil production has c
E
grown rapidly over the past decade, so higher oil prices now imply much less of a c
ti
redistribution of purchasing power overseas than in the past. Accordingly, much e s
m
of the negative effect on GDP from lower consumer spending is likely to be
o
offset by increased production and investment in the growing oil sector. In our D
projection, a $10 per barrel increase in the long-run price of oil from current levels
would lower the level of GDP by only about 5 basis points after three years, as
the drag on consumption is largely offset by higher oil investment and
production. This restraint is about one-fourth as large as it was a decade ago and
should get smaller still as U.S. oil production grows, as seen in figure 3, and the
net oil import share shrinks to zero.
Indeed, as U.S. oil trade moves into balance, the offsetting effects of a change in
the relative price of oil might be expected to net out within the domestic
economy. However, it is also possible that the marginal propensities to consume
and invest differ sufficiently across U.S. oil consumers and producers such that
increases in oil prices would still have a negative effect on overall GDP.
Even with zero net oil imports, changes in oil prices will still influence consumer
price inflation. We currently estimate that a permanent $10 per barrel rise in the
price of oil from its current level increases core inflation by less than
0.1 percentage point after two years and increases headline inflation by a
cumulative ¼ percentage point, with most of the effects occurring in the
first year.

• We estimate that real government purchases will grow 1 percent in the first
half of this year and then pick up to a 2 percent pace in the second half, as the
recent federal budget legislation translates into higher federal government
purchases.
• Net exports added 0.1 percentage point to real GDP growth in the first quarter,
and we expect it to add almost ¼ percentage point in the second. Our first-
quarter estimate is about ½ percentage point stronger than we expected in the
April Tealbook, as imports came in weaker and exports stronger than we
projected. In the second half of the year, net exports are expected to be
neutral for real GDP growth, about ¼ percentage point weaker than in the
April Tealbook, as the higher dollar restrains export growth.
• Manufacturing production increased at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the
first quarter, about half the pace projected in the April Tealbook.
Manufacturing output was strong in April, but the data on manufacturing
hours for May and the available product data suggest production pulled back
last month. Meanwhile, the new orders indexes in the national and regional
manufacturing surveys remain clustered near the high end of their range
during this expansion, and, accordingly, we expect that manufacturing output
growth will return to a solid pace in the coming months.
Over the medium term, we project real GDP growth to slow from about
2¾ percent this year to 2½ percent next year and then further to 1¾ percent in 2020.
Although fiscal policy remains expansionary and foreign growth remains solid, monetary
policy becomes progressively more restrictive.
• Compared with the April Tealbook, our forecast for real GDP growth beyond
2018 is weaker on net. As noted previously, the higher path for the dollar is

one important reason for this adjustment. Moreover, we have assumed that t l
u
O
the supply constraints we expect to be associated with the high level of
&
resource utilization will attenuate the transmission of increased aggregate e l
v
e
demand into increased output by a bit more than we had previously penciled D
n
in. In addition, we now judge that the boost to consumer spending from the o
c
E
tax cuts will be a little smaller than we had previously written down.3 Other c
ti
revisions to conditioning assumptions were generally small.4 In all, the level e s
m
of GDP is about ¼ percent lower at the end of 2020 than in our previous o
D
projection.
• Real GDP growth is projected to outpace potential growth through 2019 and
runs essentially in line with potential in 2020, resulting in a further tightening
of resource utilization over the medium term. At the end of 2020, real GDP
exceeds its potential level by 3 percent—¼ percentage point less than in the
April Tealbook but still indicative of a very tight economy.
• The box “Alternative View: A Strong but Precarious Projection” highlights
the difficulty of engineering a soft landing to the current expansion and argues
that the risk of a recession over the projection period is substantially elevated.
• With the federal government expected to run historically large and rising
deficits over the medium term, national saving is projected to trend downward
as a share of GDP. Nevertheless, private investment trends upward as a share
of the economy, with the widening gap between domestic investment and
national saving financed by increased inflows of foreign capital.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
On balance, the April and May employment reports point to a continued
tightening in the labor market and by a little more than we had expected.
3 Our assessment that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide a bit less impetus to consumption
than we had previously assumed reflects our weighing a little more heavily the fact that the tax cuts are
tilted toward high-income earners who likely have a lower marginal propensity to consume.
4 The slower population growth forecast by the Census Bureau led us to reduce the levels of both
actual and potential output by 0.1 percent by the end of the medium term.

D
prove increasingly precarious. I use a simple logit regression framework to show that while the
n
o probability of a recession in the near future is small, the odds increase substantially further along
c
E
the staff’s baseline projection. This analysis is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s historical
c
ti
difficulty with engineering a soft landing. Looking at real‐time data in staff forecasts preceding the
s
e
m Great Recession, I illustrate how this framework correctly warned of an elevated risk of a recession
o
in the near term that the staff did not fully take into account. In accordance with best practices, the
D
staff is not currently forecasting a recession directly. However, this analysis shows that we are
forecasting conditions that have presaged previous recessionary episodes and should consider
either weakening the forecast or forecasting a recession in the early 2020s.
Specifically, I estimate a logit on data from 1965:Q1 to 2018:Q1 where the left‐hand side is an
indicator of “recession within four quarters” that is generated using NBER recession dating. The
right‐hand side consists of the term spread between the 10‐year Treasury yield and the federal
funds rate, the term premium on 10‐year Treasury yields, the spread of triple‐B‐rated bonds over
Treasury yields, and the staff’s judgmental output gap.1 Financial conditions and expectations are
represented in the logit by the spreads and premiums, and the real side of the economy is
represented by the output gap. All of the explanatory variables are statistically significant
predictors of recessions.2
Figure 1 shows the recession probability generated by the logit using the June Tealbook projection.
From 2020 to 2023, the probability of a recession beginning during the following four quarters is
high. Analysis of the logit attributes the high probability to our projections of a high output gap, a
term spread that turns negative in mid‐2020, and an increasing triple‐B spread. The recession
Note: This alternative view was prepared by David S. Miller.
1 The term premium and triple‐B spread are calculated based on the FRB/US model’s structure and the
specification of their corresponding interest rates.
2 The specification is robust to using the 10‐year Treasury premium to modify the term spread variable rather
than stand as a separate explanatory variable and to replacing the output gap with the unemployment gap.

probability exceeds 0.6 by the end of 2020, a threshold that foreshadows almost every recession in O
the post‐1965 period. &
l
e
To show that this framework could have forecast the Great Recession while the staff did not, I use v
e
similar logits to calculate the near future recession probability using real‐time staff projections from D
n
three Greenbooks that precede, and coincide with, the start of the Great Recession. Each logit is o
c
estimated on data from 1965:Q1 until the most recent data available at the time of the E
c
corresponding Greenbook. The left‐hand side is the indicator of “recession within four quarters” ti
s
e
but is generated from NBER recession data that do not include the Great Recession. The right‐hand m
side includes the same variables as the original logit.3 o
D
Figure 2 shows an elevated risk of a recession within the next four quarters starting in 2006, which
is rising with each Greenbook. By the end of 2007—corresponding to when the NBER would later
determine the Great Recession began—the real‐time recession probability is high enough that,
based on the logit, a recession was a likely outcome. While the staff had slightly weakened its near‐
term projection by the December 2007 Greenbook, we did not take into account the high, and
increasing, probability of a recession within four quarters.4
The current projection suffers from dissonance: It is inconsistent with the probability of recession
it implies. The staff projection is very strong and does not explicitly forecast a recession. However,
according to my analysis, the projection implies a very high and rising probability of a recession.
One way to address this dissonance would be to modify the unobserved components of the
projection by changing the estimate of potential output, the natural rate of unemployment, or r*
to produce a lower output gap and steeper term spread. However, if we believe that the current
medium‐term projection is our best forecast through 2020, then the analysis presented here
suggests that we should pencil in an outright recession in 2021 or 2022 (we currently project that
GDP will grow more slowly than its potential rate, but not a recession).
3 These vintage Greenbooks did not contain the triple‐B yield and spread. I include the triple‐B spread in these
logits to maintain consistency with the first logit and make the reported probabilities comparable. The spread
would have been observable in real time.
4 The December 2007 Greenbook forecast real GDP growth in 2008 at 1½ percent compared with a forecast of
2¼ percent in the January 2007 Greenbook. Forecasts of real GDP growth in 2009 and later are similar in both
Greenbooks.

• An alternative estimate of private employment growth that combines the BLS o
D
information together with data from the payroll processing firm ADP points to
private job gains of 166,000 in May. The moving average of this alternative
estimate over the three months ending in May stands at 176,000, essentially
the same as the three-month moving average of the published total
payroll gains.
• The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in April and then further to
3.8 percent in the May employment report—a downward surprise of
0.2 percentage point relative to the April Tealbook projection. We now
project the unemployment rate to be 3.7 percent next quarter, 0.1 percentage
point lower than in the last Tealbook.
• The labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down in April and then fell
another 0.1 percentage point to 62.7 percent in May. For the past few years,
the participation rate has moved essentially sideways, on net, indicating some
tightening along this margin relative to its declining trend.
We continue to expect the labor market will tighten further over the medium term,
in line with above-trend GDP growth. We also continue to assume that, in an extremely
tight labor market, a larger-than-usual amount of the tightening in resource utilization
will manifest in a higher LFPR and workweek rather than in a lower unemployment rate.6
• Total payroll gains are projected to slow gradually from an average monthly
pace of about 195,000 this year to 130,000 in 2020 as GDP decelerates. This
5 This range assumes that the labor force participation rate declines in line with the staff’s estimate
of its trend. With an unchanged participation rate, the pace of monthly job gains required to keep the
unemployment rate constant ranges from 120,000 to 150,000.
6 Were we to maintain our usual Okun’s law relationship, the unemployment rate at the end of the
projection would be ¼ percentage point lower.

The projected unemployment rate at the end of 2020 is 0.1 percentage point
higher than in our April Tealbook projection, consistent with the somewhat
narrower output gap at the end of the medium term.
• The LFPR is projected to end this year at 62.7 percent and then to hold steady
through 2020, as sustained job gains and rising real wages continue to draw
individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows. When judged
against its declining trend, which is driven largely by population aging, the
flat profile of the LFPR is consistent with substantial further labor market
tightening. At the end of 2020, the LFPR is projected to be 0.6 percentage
point above our estimate of its trend and unchanged from the April Tealbook.
• We project that labor productivity in the business sector will increase an
average of 1 percent per year over the forecast period—a touch faster than its
average pace over the past five years, though somewhat less than our estimate
of its structural pace.7
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
Total consumer price inflation is currently close to 2 percent after having been
depressed by transitory factors last year.
• The 12-month change in core PCE prices stood at 1.8 percent in April, about
the same as in March and a little below our expectations in the April
Tealbook. The small downside surprise in core inflation was concentrated in
the nonmarket component, from which we take little signal for future
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly because workers hired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to
workers hired during a slack labor market.

ti
expect the 12-month change to move up to 2½ percent by July. The faster s
e
m
pace of total PCE price inflation relative to core reflects both previous large
o
D
increases in consumer energy prices and our expectation for further increases
over the next few months.
• We expect core import prices to increase at a 2¾ percent pace in the first half
of 2018, ½ percentage point less than in the April Tealbook projection based
on recent dollar appreciation. We project core import prices will be roughly
unchanged in the second half, reflecting the strengthening dollar, slowly
declining commodity prices, and moderate foreign inflation. Our projection
for import price inflation in the second half is also significantly lower than in
the April Tealbook.
• Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved little, on balance,
since the April Tealbook. Median expectations over the next 5 to 10 years
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 2.5 percent in
May, unchanged from the April reading and close to where they have been
over the past couple of years. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s
Survey of Consumer Expectations reported that the median inflation
expectation 3 years ahead rose 0.1 percentage point in April to 3.0 percent.
Finally, the TIPS-based measure of 5-to-10-year-forward inflation
compensation edged down to 2.1 percent.
• The box “Inflation Perceptions and Inflation Expectations” uses new data
from the Michigan survey to compare inflation expectations with perceptions
of realized inflation.
Core inflation is projected to edge up from 1.9 percent this year to 2.0 percent in
2019 and to 2.1 percent in 2020, as the further tightening of the economy and a gradual

Inflation Perceptions and Inflation Expectations
&
l
e
v Given the presumed role of inflation expectations in influencing actual inflation, it is
e
D
important to understand the survey evidence on expectations. Currently, however, there
n
o are many unanswered questions about measures of expected inflation from household
c
E surveys like the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. For example, it is not clear
c
ti how to interpret the fact that consumers tend to expect future inflation that is higher
s
e than official estimates of past inflation. Do survey respondents actually expect inflation
m
to be higher in the future than it is now, or do they think current inflation has been higher
o
D than indicated by the official statistics? And, does the downward drift in households’
long-term inflation expectations that began in mid-2014 reflect a decrease over time in
their perceptions of past inflation? That is, are households’ expectations somewhat
adaptive?
Insight may come from better understanding individuals’ perceptions of recent
inflation—namely, what consumers think inflation has been in the past. In 2016, the
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers began asking the following questions on
inflation perceptions four times a year.1
Short-term perceptions: During the past 12 months, do you think that prices in
general went up or went down, or stayed where they were a year ago? By about
what percent do you think prices went (up/down), on the average, during the
past 12 months?
Long-term perceptions: What about prices over the past 5 to 10 years? Do you
think prices now are higher, about the same, or lower than they were 5 to
10 years ago? By about what percent per year do you think prices went
(up/down), on the average, during the past 5 to 10 years?
Figures 1 and 2 summarize the distributions of responses on long-term inflation
perceptions and expectations from the February 2018 survey. The two distributions are

1 The Federal Reserve Board contracted the University of Michigan Survey Research Center to
include these questions. The perceptions questions are worded consistently with the questions on
inflation expectations and are posed in February, May, August, and November.

similar, with the bulk of the responses falling between 1 and 5 percent, but the
&
distribution of perceptions has slightly more responses in the right tail. (Note that l
e
inflation experiences differ across households, and the distribution of perceptions could v
e
reflect, at least in part, these differences.) D
n
o
c
Figure 3 plots the median responses for both short- and long-term inflation perceptions E
c
and expectations. As illustrated by the black lines, median long-term inflation ti
s
expectations (the solid line) have been quite similar to median long-term perceptions e
m
(the dashed line). These median readings suggest that households do not expect
o
inflation to increase relative to what they perceive to have experienced over the past 5 to D
10 years, even though the median expectations are higher than official estimates of
inflation. Median short-term inflation perceptions (red dashed line), on the other hand,
have run lower than long-term inflation perceptions as well as both short- and long-term
expectations. One natural interpretation is that households have perceived inflation as
being relatively low over the past few years, compared with the past 5 to 10 years, and
that they expect it to move up to the level of the past 5 to 10 years both over the near
term and the longer term. Measured official inflation was indeed low in 2015 and 2016.
However, headline inflation has moved up more recently, and median short-term
perceptions show just a hint of that upward drift.
The University of Michigan Survey Research Center began collecting the data on inflation
perceptions after the downward drift in long-term expectations was largely complete,
making it impossible to assess whether perceptions have declined in conjunction with
expectations. Nevertheless, the cross-sectional aspect of the data provides some
suggestive evidence on this issue. Figure 4 shows a scatterplot of individual responses to
the two long-term inflation questions and indicates that those who perceive inflation to
have been higher in the past also expect inflation to be higher in the future.2 In addition,
people who revised up their answer about long-term perceptions between surveys also
tended to revise up their long-term expectations (not shown). These correlations
suggest that the downward drift in expectations that began in 2014 could have reflected
lower perceptions, possibly in response to the recent low inflation. We hope to learn
much more from these data in the future.

D
revised down a touch in 2018 and 2019, reflecting the incoming data, the
lower path for core import prices, and the slightly lower degree of resource
utilization in this projection.
• We continue to assume that the supply constraints that attenuate the
transmission of aggregate demand into output in an extremely tight economy
will also result in slightly higher inflation than would otherwise be the case.
The data we received on wages since the April Tealbook were, on balance,
slightly stronger than expected. We continue to project a gradual acceleration in labor
compensation.
• The employment cost index (ECI) increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent in
the three months ending in March, 1.4 percentage points higher than the
forecast we wrote down in the April Tealbook. We expect this compensation
measure will increase 2¾ percent this year and next before edging up to
3 percent in 2020 as resource utilization tightens further.
• Average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the year ending in May, in line
with our expectations in the April Tealbook. We expect the 12-month change
in average hourly earnings to remain close to this pace through the near term.
• Over the medium term, growth in compensation per hour (CPH) is projected
to step up from last year’s pace of 2¾ percent to 3½ percent this year and to
4 percent in each of the next two years.
8 In total, the underlying judgmental trend is assumed to increase 10 basis points from 2017
to 2020.

• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. The nominal yield on
10-year Treasury securities in the longer run is assumed to stand at
3.4 percent; thus, after the SOMA portfolio has returned to its normal size and
composition, the term premium is assumed to be 90 basis points.
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a
normal size by mid-2021.
• With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows further to 1½ percent in 2021
and stays slightly above 1 percent in 2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate
is above its neutral level and the support from fiscal policy wanes. The
unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3½ percent in 2021 toward its
assumed natural rate in subsequent years.
• PCE price inflation hovers around 2.1 percent in 2022 and 2023 before edging
back down to the Committee’s long-run objective in later years.
• With output materially above its potential level and inflation slightly above
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to
about 4¾ percent at the end of 2021—2¼ percentage points higher than its
assumed long-run value. Thereafter, the federal funds rate moves gradually
back toward its long-run value.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
Headlines over the intermeeting period pointed to heightened political risks and
increased financial stress in several countries. These negative developments have come
against the backdrop of still-robust foreign economic activity but have increased
downside risks to our outlook. Real GDP in the foreign economies accelerated to an
annual pace of 3¼ percent in the first quarter, as a slowdown in the advanced foreign
economies (AFEs) was more than offset by outsized growth in some emerging Asian
economies and Mexico. We anticipate growth in the current quarter to move down to
k
o
2¾ percent. A pickup in the AFEs, as weather-related disruptions in Japan and Europe o
l
t
u
subside, should be more than offset by a step-down in the emerging market economies
O
&
(EMEs), in part because of the payback from the first-quarter surge. We expect growth
l
e
abroad to remain at 2¾ percent, its potential pace, through 2020. v
e
D
n
o
Balancing a number of factors, we revised down our forecast a bit over the next c
E
several quarters and left it about unchanged thereafter. Despite media commentary on a ’ l
t
n
I
weakening momentum of global growth, recent data readings have been a mix of positive
and negative surprises, with no clear-cut implications for the overall outlook. Oil prices
have increased some, but this increase has roughly offsetting effects on importers and
exporters. The dollar has appreciated strongly, which should provide some stimulus to
our trading partners. However, some EMEs with large macroeconomic imbalances
registered a tightening of their financial conditions, which should temper their growth a
bit. Finally, political developments in Italy have increased financial stresses and should
restrain growth in Italy and have some adverse spillovers to other euro-area countries.
Although our baseline outlook is only little changed, we see increased prominence
of two risks. First, the situation in Italy could become more precarious and have
significantly greater spillovers to other euro-area countries than in our baseline, a
possibility explored in our “Heightened Risk of Euro-Area Breakup” alternative scenario
in the Risks and Uncertainty section. Second, although the recent rise in financial
stresses and capital outflows has been mostly limited to relatively vulnerable EMEs (see
the box “Recent Financial Pressures in Emerging Market Economies”), there could be a
broader and more persistent ratcheting up of EME stress, a possibility discussed in the
“EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario.

Recent Financial Pressures in Emerging Market Economies
Since the April Tealbook, financial stresses have risen in emerging market economies (EMEs),
with credit spreads widening, bond and equity funds experiencing outflows, and currencies
depreciating against the dollar. In this discussion, we look more closely at the potential
factors contributing to this turn in sentiment, including rising U.S. Treasury yields, spillovers
from idiosyncratic developments in select countries, and heightened focus on EME
vulnerabilities more broadly. Among EME asset prices, we concentrate on exchange rates,
where the movements have been the most sizable.
The rise in financial stress has been especially pronounced for Turkey and Argentina, whose
k currencies have depreciated about 11 percent and 19 percent, respectively, since the April
o
o Tealbook and whose credit spreads have moved up sharply. Turkey and Argentina are also
l
t
u the two EMEs with the most significant macroeconomic vulnerabilities. In both countries,
O
concerns have risen about the laxity of fiscal and monetary policies, the independence of the
&
l central bank, and the reliance on external financing. These vulnerabilities likely rendered the
e
v
e countries susceptible to shifts in market conditions.
D
n
o
c However, the recent stresses have not been limited to Turkey and Argentina, suggesting
E
l that a common factor may have triggered the selloff in EME assets. Indeed, the notion that
’
t
n EMEs were hit by a common shock finds some support in that EMEs have been affected
I
roughly in proportion to their vulnerabilities. As seen in figure 1, when recent EME currency
depreciations are plotted against our relative vulnerability rankings, they line up well.1
1 Our vulnerability ranking is constructed by first ordering 16 EMEs according to six indicators of
vulnerability: (1) current account deficit as a percent of GDP, (2) gross government debt as a percent of
GDP, (3) average annual inflation over the past three years, (4) the five‐year change in bank credit to the
private sector as a share of GDP, (5) the ratio of external debt to exports, and (6) the ratio of foreign
exchange reserves to GDP. By construction, the higher the rankings on each measure, the higher the
vulnerability. We average the rankings across indicators for each EME. Thus, the values can theoretically
range from 1 (least vulnerable) to 16 (most vulnerable).

Exactly what shock might have led to a shift in investor sentiment toward EMEs, however, is
unclear. One possibility is that developments in Argentina and Turkey have served as a
wake‐up call to investors, leading to a broad repricing of risk in EME assets. Alternatively,
some other common shocks, such as the rise in U.S. interest rates, may have increased
pressures on EMEs. To provide an assessment, we use an empirical model relating EME
currency movements to key underlying drivers. These drivers are the 2‐year U.S. Treasury
yield to capture the general level of U.S. interest rates and near‐term monetary policy path,
the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve (10‐year minus 2‐year) as a proxy for the
opportunity cost of investing in dollar‐denominated EME bonds, U.S. high‐yield corporate
bond spreads as an indicator of broad credit market conditions for risky debt, and the VIX
index to capture general risk sentiment. The model is estimated on weekly data separately
for each EME currency to allow potentially different responses to U.S. variables depending
k
on country‐specific fundamentals and risk characteristics.2 On average, U.S. interest rates o
o
and risk sentiment explain around 20 percent of the variation in EME currencies over the t l
u
post‐crisis period, with the three interest rate variables accounting for most of the O
explanatory power.3 Additionally, countries that are assessed as more vulnerable tend to &
l
e
have larger sensitivities to changes in U.S. interest rates and the VIX. v
e
D
n
Regarding the recent movements (figure 2), the average EME currency depreciated about o
c
5 percent against the dollar from mid‐April through the third week of May, while the 2‐ and E
l
10‐year Treasury yields rose 19 basis points and 24 basis points, respectively.4 During this t ’
n
I

difference form.

are associated with 0.5 percent, 0.25 percent, and 0.3 percent depreciation of the average EME currency,
respectively.
4 Since the third week of May, the average EME currency is little changed, on net, although increased
political uncertainty in Italy weighed on risk sentiment and put downward pressure on Treasury yields and
risky asset prices. See the Financial Market Developments section for a detailed discussion.

n period, the model‐based path moved down only 1½ percent, suggesting a material but
o
c
E relatively modest role for the rise in the Treasury yields. However, it is notable that during
’ l the period from last October to early February, EME currencies appreciated relative to the
t
n
I dollar even as 2‐ and 10‐year U.S. Treasury yields increased significantly, suggesting that the
link between Treasury yields and EME currencies is relatively loose. Nonetheless, it is also
possible that the recent sharp depreciation in EME currencies reflects some catch‐up
following their earlier failure to respond to rising interest rates in the United States.
At this point, concerns about EME financial stresses should not be overstated. EME
sovereign bond spreads and broad measures of EME financial stress, shown in figure 3,
remain well below levels seen in other recent stress episodes such as that in early 2016
associated with concerns about China. The fact that EMEs with lower vulnerabilities have
not been as affected suggests that investors have continued to differentiate between
countries based on economic fundamentals. Moreover, incoming data for the EMEs
continue to point to robust growth. As such, the recent tightening of financial conditions
has left little imprint on our overall EME forecast. However, this tightening points to the
possibility of more severe financial stresses, as described in the “EME Turbulence and
Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.

Oil prices have put upward pressure on foreign inflation in the first half of the
year, and, with further oil price increases and currency depreciations since the April
Tealbook, we revised up our inflation forecast for the second half of the year. In the
AFEs, we expect inflation to edge down to 1¾ percent by the end of the year, as oil
prices decline, and to remain near that pace thereafter. With underlying inflation
pressures expected to be contained over the next few years, we continue to assume a
gradual withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus in the AFEs. Indeed, we pushed back
the next policy rate hikes by the Bank of Canada (BOC), the Bank of England (BOE),
and the European Central Bank (ECB) on weaker-than-expected data and elevated
uncertainties about the outlook. In contrast, the increase in oil prices coupled with capital
k
o
outflows and currency depreciations have led some EMEs to tighten monetary policy. o
l
t
Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey raised their policy rates, and Brazil, u
O
&
contrary to expectations, did not cut its rate.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
n
o
c
E
 Euro area. Real GDP growth slowed from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter to
l
’
t
n
1.6 percent in the first, partly owing to temporary factors, such as labor strikes and I
severe cold in both France and Germany. Key survey indicators (such as PMIs) have
softened further this quarter but remain at levels consistent with solid growth.
Accordingly, we project growth to rebound to just above 2 percent in the current
quarter, before decelerating to 1½ percent by 2019. This forecast is about
½ percentage point lower in 2018 and ¼ percentage point lower in 2019 relative to
the April Tealbook, primarily reflecting recent and expected financial tensions and
uncertainty generated by political developments in Italy.
In Italy, we expect a protracted period of political uncertainty and elevated financial
stress as antiestablishment parties push for substantial fiscal easing and challenge
European institutions. That said, our baseline outlook assumes that internal political
conflicts and market pressures ultimately prevent the Italian government from
implementing radical proposals such as creating a parallel currency. In addition,
while we expect some spillovers to other euro-area countries, our baseline envisions
that investors ultimately retain confidence in the integrity of the euro area and its
institutions, including its financial backstops. Accordingly, while Italian growth is
projected to fall close to zero later this year and in 2019, overall euro-area growth
should moderate to near its potential rate and remain there over the forecast period.

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 1, 2018
However, much uncertainty attends this projection, and a resurgence of severe
financial stresses in the euro area is a clear downside risk.
Higher oil prices should further boost inflation from 2 percent in the first quarter to
2¼ percent in the second and third quarters. However, with core inflation projected
to rise very slowly from around 1 percent this quarter, we expect headline inflation to
fall back to 1½ percent by 2019 as retail energy prices stabilize before edging higher
in 2020 as slack diminishes. Given increased downside risks and slightly weaker
outlooks for growth and inflation, we now expect the ECB to wait until the fourth
quarter of 2019 to begin raising its policy rate, two quarters later than previously
k
o assumed.
o
l
t
u
O  United Kingdom. Real GDP growth plunged unexpectedly from 1.6 percent in the
&
l fourth quarter to a mere 0.4 percent in the first, partly owing to a weather-related
e
v
e contraction in the construction sector. Growth is expected to rebound to 1½ percent
D
n
in the current quarter. This figure is ¼ percentage point lower than in the April
o
c
E
Tealbook, as most data, such as April PMIs and confidence indicators, suggest a bit
l
’
t
n less momentum than expected. Thereafter, growth should edge up to 1¾ percent,
I
supported by accommodative monetary policy.
Headline inflation is projected to remain unchanged at 2½ percent in the second
quarter, as the boost from higher energy prices is offset by weaker-than-expected core
inflation readings. Thereafter, we continue to expect inflation to fall to the BOE’s
2 percent target by the end of 2020. With the recent weakness in economic activity,
we now anticipate that the BOE will delay hiking rates until the third quarter of 2018,
one quarter later than assumed in the April Tealbook. This path takes the policy rate
from 0.5 percent to 1½ percent by the end of forecast period, ¼ percentage point
lower than assumed in April.
 Japan. Real GDP contracted 0.6 percent in the first quarter, well below the
1¼ percent expansion forecast in the April Tealbook. The contraction seems largely
driven by a big step-down in inventory investment and the effects of bad weather on
private consumption. Incoming indicators have been mixed but, on net, suggest
growth will rebound to 1¼ percent in the current quarter. We expect that growth will
move down to a near-potential pace of ¾ percent by next year.
Page 46 of 132

--- Page 50 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 1, 2018
Inflation appears set to turn negative in the second quarter, as data through May
indicate that food and durable goods prices declined sharply. As higher oil prices
feed through to consumer prices and food prices stabilize, inflation should return to
positive territory in the third quarter. We assume that underlying inflation pressures
will remain quite subdued despite a very tight labor market, and we project inflation
to be just 1 percent in 2020. Accordingly, we assume that the Bank of Japan will
maintain a highly accommodative policy stance throughout the forecast period,
waiting until late 2020 to lift its target for the 10-year Japanese government bond
yield above zero.
k
 Canada. Real GDP growth slowed to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, from o
o
l
1.7 percent in the fourth, reflecting strong imports, a sharp contraction in residential t
u
O
investment, and a slowdown in private consumption growth. Although first-quarter &
l
growth was ¾ percentage point below our April estimate, we are taking little signal e
v
e
going forward, as monthly indicators point to solid underlying momentum late in the D
n
o
quarter. Moreover, recent indicators, including the April employment report and c
E
manufacturing PMI, suggest that growth will step up to almost 2½ percent this ’ l
t
n
quarter. Thereafter, we expect growth to continue at around that pace through early I
2019, before slowing to just below 2 percent in 2020. Relative to the April Tealbook,
this projection is somewhat stronger in the second half of 2018 and in 2019 because
of higher oil prices.
We have inflation slowing from 3 percent in the current quarter to the BOC’s
2 percent target by mid-2019. As resource utilization continues to increase, the BOC
is expected to gradually raise its policy rate from the current 1.25 percent to 3 percent
in 2020. With data having come in a bit weaker, we now expect the next rate hike to
be in the third quarter of this year, a quarter later than assumed in the April Tealbook.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Growth continues to be solid, rising to 7.2 percent in the first quarter and
projected to be 6¾ percent this quarter. Economic activity has been boosted by
strong external demand and a recovery in industrial activity following the removal of
production caps on high-polluting industries. However, fixed investment and retail
sales have decelerated, suggesting that the tighter regulations on shadow banking
activity are starting to affect the real economy. We expect growth to moderate further
Page 47 of 132

--- Page 51 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 1, 2018
to 6¼ percent in the second half of this year and to edge down to 6 percent by 2020,
in line with potential.
The proposed U.S. tariffs on about $50 billion of Chinese imports, if implemented,
would have a limited direct effect on the Chinese economy, as these goods account
for a small share of China’s GDP. However, a substantial broadening of the tariffs to
additional products could indeed pose a material risk to the outlook for China and the
emerging Asian region as a whole.
Inflation has been very subdued, at an estimated 1¼ percent this quarter, because of
k falling food prices. We expect inflation to rise temporarily to 3 percent next quarter,
o
o
as food prices normalize and higher oil prices pass through to retail fuel prices, but to
l
t
u
O settle at 2½ percent by the end of this year.
&
l
e
v  Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth in emerging Asia excluding China jumped
e
D
n to 5.7 percent in the first quarter, 1¼ percentage point higher than projected in the
o
c April Tealbook, owing in large part to outsized export growth in Hong Kong and
E
l
’
t strong domestic demand in India and Thailand. Furthermore, activity rebounded in
n
I
Korea, as expected, after a fourth-quarter contraction. Growth in the region should
moderate to 3¼ percent in the second quarter, as activity in Hong Kong and Thailand
normalizes. Thereafter, we expect growth to settle at around 3¾ percent. This
projection is down a touch for the rest of this year on higher oil prices and about
unchanged thereafter.
 Mexico. Mexican real GDP grew at a robust 4.6 percent pace in the first quarter, up
from 3.6 percent in the fourth and well above our April Tealbook forecast. Industrial
output rebounded after a lackluster 2017, boosted by oil production, construction, and
exports, particularly of autos. These data, together with an upward revision to the
projection for U.S. manufacturing growth, led us to revise up second-quarter growth
to 3 percent, notwithstanding some tightening in financial conditions amid the recent
selloff of EME assets and more Mexico-specific concerns related to NAFTA and the
July presidential elections. We see growth remaining at around 3 percent over the
forecast period, supported by strong external demand, diminished fiscal drag, and
higher real incomes.
Headline inflation is expected to continue declining to 3 percent this quarter, from
4 percent in the first. Although this drop partly reflects the fading effect of past food
Page 48 of 132

--- Page 52 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 1, 2018
price increases, core inflation also continues to fall. Consistent with this decline, the
Bank of Mexico kept its policy rate unchanged at its May meeting but emphasized
that it is monitoring the potential pass-through from the recent depreciation of
the peso.
 Brazil. Brazilian GDP grew 1.8 percent in the first quarter, up from 1 percent in the
fourth, supported by a rebound in exports and a modest pickup in household demand.
Nevertheless, growth was significantly weaker than expected, and falling PMIs and
confidence indicators in April suggest that this weakness extended into the second
quarter. Together with somewhat tighter financial conditions and the recent
k
widespread strikes by truck drivers, these data led us to slash our growth estimate in o
o
l
the second quarter 1 percentage point, to just over 1½ percent. We continue to see t
u
O
the pace of activity climbing gradually to 3 percent by 2019, although political &
l
uncertainty ahead of this October’s presidential election remains a key downside risk. e
v
e
D
n
Given significant economic slack, we expect inflation to edge down to a subdued o
c
E
2¾ percent in the second quarter, well below the inflation target. However, noting
l
’
t
the recent volatility in financial markets, the central bank stood pat in its previous n
I
meeting, pausing an easing cycle that had begun in late 2016.
 Argentina. In the face of rapidly escalating pressure on the peso, Argentine
authorities announced on May 8 that they were seeking an IMF program. This
decision followed several unsuccessful attempts by the central bank to shore up
market confidence, including three intermeeting policy rate hikes that raised the
overnight rate a cumulative 12.75 percentage points to 40 percent. The deterioration
in market sentiment is rooted in growing concerns about persistently high fiscal
deficits, the independence of the central bank, and the increasing dependence on
external financing. We marked down growth considerably this year. We expect
confidence will improve and activity will pick up again in 2019. However, there is a
material risk that Argentina’s macroeconomic adjustment process could be costlier
and more prolonged than predicted.
 Turkey. Turkey has also come under substantial market pressure in recent weeks,
with the lira plunging close to 20 percent and credit spreads rising sharply. The
central bank responded to the turmoil by significantly tightening its monetary policy,
reversing some of the currency depreciation. Along with Argentina, Turkey’s
economy stands out among EMEs for its macroeconomic fragility, including
Page 49 of 132

widening fiscal and current account deficits and double-digit inflation amid growing
concerns about the central bank’s independence. Moreover, political uncertainty has
increased, with snap presidential and parliamentary elections called for late June
reducing the likelihood that the government will take the necessary policy actions to
address the country’s economic imbalances in the near term.

Financial Market Developments
Outside of this box, the Financial Market Developments section of the Tealbook is
based on information that was available by 5:00 p.m. EDT on May 31. On June 1, at
8:30 a.m. EDT, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Employment Situation
Repor t for May 2018. While the release was reportedly interpreted by market
participants as stronger than expected, by 9:00 a.m. (30 minutes after the official
release), long-term interest rates were only a few basis points above their levels at
5:00 p.m. on May 31, and equity index futures were up by about ½ percent.
Domestic financial markets were buffeted by increased concerns about the
outlook for foreign growth and political developments in Italy. On net, Treasury yields
moved down some, market-based measures of the expected levels of the federal funds
rate at the ends of 2019 and 2020 decreased moderately, and the dollar appreciated
notably as a range of AFE and EME currencies and sovereign bonds came under
pressure. However, broad domestic stock price indexes increased, on net, as generally
strong corporate earnings reports helped support prices.
 Sovereign spreads in peripheral Europe and several vulnerable EMEs widened

A staff model that adjusts market rates for estimated term premiums implies
roughly two hikes over the same period.
 A straight read of market quotes also suggests that the expected levels of the
federal funds rate for the end of 2019 and the end of 2020 each fell about
15 basis points—adjusting for term premiums, they fell an estimated 8 basis
points and 5 basis points, respectively.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Political developments that amplified risks and macroeconomic data releases that
signaled a moderation in growth abroad weighed on prices of foreign risk assets over the
intermeeting period. These foreign developments, together with a still-solid economic
outlook for the United States, supported the dollar.
In Europe, financial markets reacted negatively to the political upheaval in Italy,
which was viewed as potentially undermining the country’s progress on fiscal
consolidation and rekindling fears about euro-area stability. Markets were also
concerned by the prospect of snap elections in Spain. Peripheral European 10-year
sovereign spreads jumped—123 basis points in Italy, 94 basis points in Greece, 52 basis
points in Portugal, and 44 basis points in Spain—and Italian sovereign CDS spreads also
widened dramatically. The resulting flight-to-safety flows, along with weaker-than-

The value of euro-area bank equities declined sharply, as investors were highly
attentive to political stresses in Italy and Spain, weakening macroeconomic data, and
ongoing restructuring troubles at Deutsche Bank. Euro-area bank stock indexes declined
14 percent, with Italian bank equity prices falling 20 percent. Broader measures of equity
prices declined much less, on net, as other sectors benefited from currency weakness and
lower interest rates in the core economies.

Against the backdrop of the notable increase in U.S. interest rates since late 2017,
recent political developments in several fragile EMEs have intensified concerns about
emerging economies’ financial vulnerabilities, leading to a sharp appreciation of the
dollar against these currencies over the intermeeting period. (For more details, see the
box “Recent Financial Pressures in Emerging Market Economies” in the International
Economic Developments and Outlook section.) Exchange rates depreciated against the
dollar by 22 percent in Argentina, 10 percent in Turkey, and 6 percent in Brazil following
adverse domestic developments (both economic and political). The Mexican peso
depreciated by about 5 percent amid political uncertainty and an absence of progress in
NAFTA negotiations. Equity indexes in some EMEs declined by up to 11 percent, while
broad measures of EME equity prices decreased by up to 4 percent. EME mutual funds
saw slight net outflows, and EME sovereign spreads widened about 29 basis points
on net.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period—including the May FOMC
statement and the May FOMC meeting minutes—elicited only minor reactions in asset
markets. However, the Committee’s characterization of inflation in both the statement
and the minutes garnered substantial attention. In particular, market commentaries noted
the passages stating that both headline and core inflation have moved “close to 2 percent”
and the addition of the word “symmetric” to characterize the inflation objective over the s
t
e
medium term. Market participants also noted a reference in the FOMC minutes k

model that adjusts for estimated term premiums implies that market participants expect
roughly two hikes over the same period. Both of these readings are little changed from
the time of the May FOMC meeting.
At horizons beyond the end of this year, market-based measures of the expected
path of the federal funds rate fell somewhat, with most of the declines occurring late in
the intermeeting period as concerns regarding political developments in Europe

intensified. On net, a straight read of market quotes suggests that the expected path fell
15 basis points at the end of 2019 and 13 basis points at the end of 2020. However, after
a staff model is used to adjust for term premiums, those decreases in the expected path
were estimated to be only 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. Regarding the
level of the path in the medium term, a straight read of market quotes suggests that
market participants expect approximately two hikes cumulatively in 2019 and 2020
(approximately three after adjusting for term premiums).
Longer-term nominal Treasury yields fell somewhat, on net, since the May
FOMC meeting, with 10-year yields decreasing 13 basis points. The decline was about
equally split between TIPS yields and inflation compensation. Yields experienced some
notable one-day moves, particularly late in the period. Following the release of the
advance estimate of April retail sales, long-term yields moved up about 7 basis points.
Subsequently, however, yields declined in reaction to weaker-than-expected European
PMI prints and, shortly thereafter, in response to political developments in Italy. (For
analysis of the information content of the yield curve for the probability of recession, see
the box “Don’t Fear the Long-Term Spread.”)
Option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS over Treasury yields remained
about unchanged over the intermeeting period. Overall, we continue to see limited
effects on MBS prices from the implementation of the balance sheet normalization
program, although market participants reportedly expect that MBS spreads might widen s

expectations, particularly for the technology sector, which outperformed the broader

the potential for trade wars weighed on equity prices at times. Option-implied volatility

just a couple of percentage points above the very low levels that prevailed before early
February.
1 Since the start of balance sheet normalization in October 2017 through late May 2018, the
Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities have decreased by $79 billion, and its holdings of agency
securities have decreased by $42 billion, as reported in the weekly H.4.1 statistical release.

Don’t Fear the Long‐Term Spread
Commonly cited measures of the term spread, such as the difference between the 10‐year and
2‐year nominal Treasury yields, have dropped over the past several years (figure 1, blue line). This
trend has raised some concerns because low term spreads appear to have statistical power for
predicting recessions over the coming year.1 In this discussion, we document that for predicting
recessions, a “long‐term spread”—the spread in yields between a far‐off maturity such as 10 years
and a shorter maturity such as 1 or 2 years—is inferior to a more economically intuitive alternative,
a “near‐term spread.”
We focus on the difference between 5‐quarter‐ahead and 1‐quarter‐ahead forward interest rates
(figure 1, red line). This near‐term spread is driven largely by the market’s expectations for the path
of the federal funds rate over the year ahead. Indeed, the near‐term spread co‐varies closely with a
survey‐based measure of such expectations, the dotted red line. Currently, the near‐term spread is
not much below its long‐run average level. Looking ahead, the staff projection suggests that the
near‐term spread will decline, on net, as the policy rate trends toward its neutral level.2 If instead
the near‐term spread becomes decidedly negative, that would signal that market participants expect
the Fed to significantly lower rates in the year ahead, presumably owing to an economic slowdown.
Consistent with this reasoning, our empirical analysis finds that a relatively low near‐term spread
implies a higher probability of a recession over the next four quarters, similar to findings using
long‐term spreads. Moreover, we find that, after conditioning on a near‐term spread, long‐term
spreads offer no additional predictive power for past recessions.

1 The predictive value of long‐term spreads has not diminished of late, as confirmed in Michael D. Bauer and
Thomas M. Mertens (2018), “Economic Forecasts with the Yield Curve,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2018‐07 (San
Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, March 5); and Peter Johansson and Andrew Meldrum (2018),
“Predicting Recession Probabilities Using the Slope of the Yield Curve,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 1). The latter paper also finds that when the first three principal
components of the yield curve are included as regressors, the current probability of recession is lower than is
implied by conditioning on the term slope alone.
2 Over the forecast period, constructing the long‐term spread required interpolation from the yields included in
the staff projection; the near‐term spread is driven largely by the inertial Taylor rule that the staff uses to set the
path of short ‐term interest rates.

Our analysis is based on a probit model, estimated on data from 1972:Q1 to 2018:Q1, where the
probability of transition to recession in the four quarters ahead is a function of the near‐term and
long‐term spreads and, in some specifications, added controls. In this model, the near‐term spread
is highly significant; all else being equal, when it falls from its mean level by one standard deviation
(80 basis points), the probability of recession increases by almost 40 percentage points. In
contrast, the coefficient on the long‐term spread is economically small and not statistically
different from zero.3 As shown in figure 2, the fitted conditional probabilities of recession from our
model (red line) show somewhat sharper spikes before recessions than a model using only the
long‐term spread (blue line).
While the predicted recession probabilities from the two models generally track each other fairly
closely, a noticeable divergence appears in the forecast period. The model based on long‐term
spreads suggests that the probability of recession will move up considerably as the long‐term
spread falls well below its long‐run mean level. However, the model based on the near‐term
spread suggests that the probability of recession will increase much less, as short‐term rates in the
staff’s projection flatten but do not invert in the medium term.
The forecast aside, the main lesson we take away from this exercise is that the current near‐term
spread, which arguably serves as a proxy for market expectations of Federal Reserve policy,
suggests the market is putting fairly low odds on a recession‐induced rate cut over the next four
quarters. More generally, our findings do not support appealing to the long‐term spread for a
different signal about year‐ahead economic growth.

3 Controls included the level of the 30‐day Treasury bill rate and the “excess bond premium” from Simon
Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajsek (2012), “Credit Spreads and Business Cycle Fluctuations,” American Economic Review,
vol. 102 (June), pp. 1692–720. The controls were included in separate estimations to test whether our main findings
are robust to the inclusion of the controls. Figure 2 shows results from a specification without the controls to
isolate and illustrate the effect of the near‐term slope.
In another departure from the standard literature, we drop from the estimation any observations in which the
economy was already in recession in the previous quarter. This choice enables us to estimate the probability of
transition into recession, rather than the probability of either transitioning or remaining in recession, which most
studies estimate. This change lowers the current recession probability estimate based on the far‐term spread from
about 30 percent to 20 percent. We also drop observations during which the effective lower bound was binding,
following other recent studies.

Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds
over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened moderately for both
investment- and speculative-grade firms, with speculative-grade bond spreads up by
about 25 basis points. However, these spreads remain low by historical standards.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Over the intermeeting period, short-term funding markets remained generally
stable despite still-elevated spreads of some private money market instruments to rates
reflecting the expected path of the federal funds rate.2 Spreads on both nonfinancial
commercial paper and certificates of deposit, particularly at one-month and longer tenors,
have edged down further since the previous FOMC meeting. Similarly, the three-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR decreased slightly over the intermeeting period, while OIS rates were
little changed, leading to a narrowing of the LIBOR–OIS spread. While some of the
factors contributing to pressures in short-term funding markets have eased recently, the
three-month LIBOR–OIS spread remains significantly wider than at the start of the year.
Because elevated rates on other short-term investments offered an attractive
alternative for market participants, take-up at the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP facility
remained low, averaging about $5 billion per day.
The implied rate on July federal funds futures declined about 3½ basis points after
s
t
the release of the May FOMC minutes, which noted the possibility of a technical e
k
r
adjustment of the administered IOER rate to a level 5 basis points below the top of the a
M
target range for the federal funds rate. Reportedly, market participants generally expect l
a
ci
the adjustment, which is intended to keep the federal funds rate well within the FOMC’s n
a
n
target range, to be announced during the June FOMC meeting. Fi
2 On May 7, the CME began trading one- and three-month futures on the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (SOFR), one of the Fed’s new overnight Treasury repo rates. Despite limited trading so far,
the launch was in line with expectations and is an important step in the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that financing conditions for
businesses and households remain supportive of economic activity on balance.
• Bank lending to businesses and the issuance of institutional leveraged loans
were strong in April, offsetting seasonal weakness in corporate bond issuance.
Corporate earnings increased notably in the first quarter in part because of the
enactment of the new tax legislation, and spreads on corporate debt and
institutional leveraged loans remained low.
• Mortgage credit has remained widely available for most borrowers; for
borrowers with low credit scores, conditions remain tight but have continued
to ease. Growth in home-purchase mortgages has slowed a bit and refinancing
activity has continued to be muted in recent months, with both developments
partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year.
• Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the
first few months of 2018, on balance, and remained largely supportive of
growth in household spending. However, consumer credit grew at a slower
pace in the first quarter compared with the rapid pace observed late last year,
and the supply of consumer credit to borrowers with subprime credit scores
continued to tighten.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative over
the intermeeting period. Although corporate bond spreads widened, on net, particularly
for speculative-grade borrowers, they remained low by historical standards. Gross
issuance of corporate bonds in April was below its average pace over the previous few s
n
o
months; however, this step-down likely reflects the typical slowdown that occurs during ti
di
the corporate earnings reporting season. Preliminary data for May suggests that corporate n
o
C
bond issuance has returned to a moderate pace.

Growth of outstanding C&I loans was strong in April at both large and small
domestic banks as well as at foreign banks. This stronger C&I loan growth follows a
period of weaker growth that was attributed in the April SLOOS to weak loan demand,
stemming in part from the widespread availability of internal funds and financing from
other sources of credit. Preliminary data for May suggests some moderation of C&I
loan growth.
The market for institutional leveraged loans continued to suggest highly
accommodative conditions. Issuance volume remained strong in April, with the proceeds
continuing to be mostly targeted toward refinancing. New money issuance was roughly
in line with average levels earlier this year, suggesting little change in the demand to raise
new funds through this market. Spreads on newly issued institutional leveraged loans
were close to their post-crisis lows in April, with preliminary data for May suggesting
that spreads narrowed further for higher-rated loans and were roughly unchanged for
lower-rated loans.
All told, net debt financing for the corporate sector in April continued at a
moderate pace. With respect to the composition of net debt financing, strong net issuance
of C&I and institutional leveraged loans in April was partly offset by a net paydown in
corporate bonds outstanding.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained stable over the
intermeeting period. Although the aggregate leverage ratio for nonfinancial corporations
remained high, the ratio of interest expense to cash flow remained near multidecade lows,
reflecting low yields on corporate debt and strong corporate earnings. The first-quarter
earnings reporting season, which began in April but continued into the current
intermeeting period, saw earnings announcements that significantly and broadly beat
Wall Street forecasts. Wall Street analysts have also slightly revised up their forecasts for
the remainder of the year.
Other measures also point to stable corporate credit quality. The volume of
s
nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades somewhat outpaced the very small volume of bond n
o
downgrades in April. The six-month trailing bond default rate ticked up in April to about

The volume of equity issuance through initial offerings in April was about in line
with its average pace over the past few years, while the volume for seasoned offerings
decreased a bit from its robust pace in the first quarter, in part because of the earnings
blackout period that also affected corporate bond issuance. Completed stock repurchases
in the first quarter were at their highest levels in two years, partly reflecting increased
cash distributions to shareholders following the tax reform.
Small Businesses
Credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative
over the intermeeting period, and data on new commercial loans and leases to small
businesses from Thomson Reuters/PayNet suggest that originations have picked up in
recent months. Measures of small business sentiment—including those with respect to
plans for expansion and capital expenditure—are little changed and remain near post-
crisis highs. Recent indicators of loan performance remain strong, with delinquency rates
near historical lows.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) also remained
accommodative. Even so, the growth of CRE loans held by banks ticked down in April.
While growth slowed across all three major CRE loan types, the slowdown was most
pronounced for construction and land development loans.
Spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed
over the intermeeting period, remaining near their post-crisis lows. CMBS issuance, in
general, has been robust this year, although it softened somewhat in April, partly
reflecting seasonal factors. Market participants expect issuance to continue to decline in
the near term because of competition from alternate lending sources such as direct loans
from banks and nonbank financial institutions, a reduction in the volume of maturing pre-
crisis-era loans that need to be refinanced, and fewer property acquisitions. Meanwhile,
the delinquency rate on mortgages in CMBS pools continued to decline, with borrowers’
ability to refinance maturing loans boosted by rising property values and low spreads on
newly issued securities.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Over the intermeeting period, debt financing continued to be readily available to
municipalities at fairly attractive terms. Yields on 20-year general obligation (GO) bonds

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) June 1, 2018
decreased slightly more than yields on Treasury securities of comparable maturity. In
addition, gross issuance in April was solid, as issuance continued to recover from the
slow pace recorded at the start of the year. Compared with the same month last year,
issuance for new capital expenditures was up slightly, while issuance earmarked for
refinancing was essentially the same. On aggregate, the credit quality of GO bonds
remained stable in April, with modest numbers of upgrades and downgrades in
credit ratings.
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS
Residential Real Estate
Over the intermeeting period, rates on 30-year conforming mortgages declined, on
net, about in line with yields on agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities.
Growth in home-purchase mortgages has slowed a bit and refinancing activity has
continued to be muted in recent months, in part reflecting the notable increase in
mortgage rates earlier this year. That said, conditions in the residential mortgage market
appeared to be healthy on balance. The delinquency rate on residential mortgages, which
had ticked up following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, retreated in February and March.
In addition, financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained
accommodative for most borrowers. The maximum allowed debt-service-to-income ratio
for borrowers with high credit scores edged up in the first quarter, with current levels near
but still below the pre-crisis peak. For borrowers with low credit scores, conditions
remain tight but have continued to ease.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the first
few months of 2018 and remained largely supportive of growth in household
spending. Growth in consumer credit slowed a bit in the first quarter, as credit card
balances edged down slightly after having surged in the fourth quarter of last year.
Household demand for consumer credit appeared to remain solid in recent months.

This tightening of credit supply for subprime borrowers comes against a backdrop of
some signs of deterioration in the credit performance of loans extended to such borrowers
over recent years, such as higher delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans. That
said, the likelihood of success in opening a new credit account of any kind—a measure
that is helpful in tracking credit supply conditions—remained near its pre-crisis peak for
subprime borrowers.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n
U
&
As in the April Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of s
k
s
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark Ri
used by the FOMC.
We judge the risks around our projection for real GDP growth as being balanced.
On the upside, the impetus to economic growth could be greater than we expect. For
instance, business sentiment and profit expectations have rallied, apparently in response
to the recent changes to fiscal policy and prospects for deregulation; our models that take
these indicators into account predict a faster pace of business investment than we have
built into the projection. On the downside, the recent tax cuts could produce a smaller
boost to aggregate demand than we have written down. For instance, consumers in the
upper part of the income distribution, toward whom the tax benefits are skewed, could
have even lower marginal propensities to consume than we have assumed. Another
possibility is that the economic spillovers stemming from political turmoil in Italy could
be substantial.
While we have left our assessment of risks unchanged for now, we are grappling
with staff and outside analysis indicating that some aspects of our forecast are consistent
with a more substantial slowdown in economic activity than we currently project.1 For
instance, the box “Alternative View: A Strong but Precarious Projection” argues that the
constellation of paths for the output gap, federal funds rate, 10-year Treasury yield, and
bond spreads in our projection has, in the past, been consistent with a recession. More
generally, the staff is not very good at forecasting recessions, which historically have
generated sharp increases in the unemployment rate. As we analyze these issues further,
we will continue to reassess the balance of risks.
With regard to inflation, we still see average uncertainty and balanced risks
around our projection. To the downside of our modal outlook, the inflation expectations
relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower than in the baseline or may
1 Indeed, these analyses motivated our move to temper the strength of real activity in the baseline
projection over the past two Tealbooks.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario illustrates the
outcomes associated with a recession triggered by a sharp correction in asset valuations.
The second scenario examines the consequences of a more severe manifestation of supply
constraints than is built into the baseline projection. In contrast, in the third scenario, the
extended period of very high resource utilization envisioned in the baseline projection
leads to persistent positive effects on the productive capacity of the economy—a form of
“positive hysteresis.” The fourth scenario illustrates the consequences of a lower natural
rate of unemployment that is initially misperceived by the central bank. In the fifth
scenario, we analyze the effects of a heightened risk of a breakup of the euro area that
reverberates around the global economy. The sixth scenario considers the possibility that
financial turbulence in emerging market economies (EMEs) leads to a global economic
slowdown and a stronger appreciation of the dollar.
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of three staff models that embed
different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.2 With one exception, the federal
funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline; the first scenario, which
features a recession, allows for a more aggressive monetary policy response in the early
quarters of the simulation. In addition, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio
are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios.
2 The three models used are: (1) FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the
U.S. economy; (2) a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the
labor market similar to that described in Mark L. Gertler, Luca Sala, and Antonella Trigari (2008), “An
Estimated Monetary DSGE Model with Unemployment and Staggered Nominal Wage Bargaining,”
Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 40 (8), pp. 1713–64; and (3) SIGMA, which is a calibrated
multicountry DSGE model.

Financial Correction with Return to Effective Lower Bound [FRB/US]

Asset valuations in equity and corporate bond markets are still considered to be at t

s
curtailment of credit to households and businesses. In addition, we assume negative k
s
Ri
shocks to consumption, investment, and aggregate labor hours beyond those implied by
the initial tightening of financial conditions. These negative shocks could be interpreted
as changes in sentiment (or animal spirits) but also possibly as further adverse effects of
tighter leverage constraints and disruption in the supply of credit that are not captured by
the standard equations of the FRB/US model. Finally, consistent with the historical
tendency of the Committee to cut rates aggressively in downturns, we assume that, at the
onset of the recession, the federal funds rate is determined by the non-inertial Taylor rule.
With stock market prices falling about 25 percent by the end of 2018 and the
triple-B corporate bond spread rising about 200 basis points above the baseline, real GDP
contracts for several consecutive quarters beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018. The
unemployment rate increases 2¾ percentage points—roughly the historical average of the
increases observed in the recessions that have occurred in the post–World War II
period—reaching 6½ percent in late 2019. Core and headline PCE inflation fall
½ percentage point below the baseline by early 2020. With policymakers reacting
quickly to the downturn, the federal funds rate returns to the effective lower bound in the
second quarter of 2019 and stays there until the end of 2020; thereafter, it gradually
increases and reaches about 3 percent by the end of 2023.3
Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model]
In the baseline projection, the unemployment rate declines to a little below
3½ percent by early 2019 and remains below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate for a
number of years. However, with the economy operating so far above its potential level,
supply constraints could bind even more severely than we have assumed in the baseline
projection. For instance, when the unemployment rate is unusually low, filling a vacancy
becomes more difficult, which could imply a reduced pace of hiring and a substantially
3 With the inertial Taylor rule, the Committee would cut rates less aggressively. As a result, the
federal funds rate would not reach the effective lower bound and economic outcomes would be worse; the
unemployment rate would be ½ percentage point higher at its peak, and real GDP growth would be
¾ percentage point lower at its trough.

projection, and this gap persists over the forecast horizon. However, GDP growth is
close to the baseline throughout the projection horizon as, in this model, more-intense
utilization of capital compensates for the reduction in labor input. Because of higher

2¾ percent in early 2020. Monetary policymakers are assumed to infer resource slack
from the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate is slightly above the baseline as
the effect of higher inflation dominates the effect of the smaller unemployment gap.
Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]
In contrast to the previous scenario, the hot labor market in the baseline projection
is assumed in this scenario to have persistent positive effects on the productive capacity
of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as “positive hysteresis.” Specifically,
we assume that persistent exposure to a hot economy reduces exits from the labor force
and generates additional entrants, causing the trend labor force participation rate to rise
about 1 percentage point above the baseline by the end of 2023. Furthermore, we assume
that the experience that workers gain through greater employment lowers the natural rate
of unemployment ½ percentage point by the end of 2023. Both of these favorable
developments are assumed to be recognized in real time by monetary policymakers.5
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ¼ percentage point more
per year over the projection period than in the baseline. This additional room to grow
allows real GDP growth to run at a similar increment above the baseline. As a result, the
4 Since the previous round, we have made a few technical refinements in the implementation of
this scenario, which we believe allow us to more accurately quantify the marginal effects of the model’s
nonlinearities on the simulated outcomes. The paths of the unemployment rate and inflation in this scenario
are slightly lower in this round than they would have been under the previous round’s implementation.
5 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the
natural rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-
generating components.

Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [FRB/US]
Ri
Over the past several years, the staff has lowered its estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment. Today’s lower natural rate could reflect low-frequency changes in
various demographic factors such as the age and educational distribution of the
population. In this scenario, we entertain the possibility that these factors have reduced
the natural rate of unemployment by a larger amount than is assumed in the baseline.
Specifically, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 3¾ percent for
the past few years and will remain at that level in the future. Furthermore, policymakers
and the staff continue, for a time, to misperceive the level of the natural rate; their
perceptions converge to the true level only gradually, and that convergence is not
complete by the end of 2023.
Given the lower natural rate, the unemployment rate in the scenario declines
½ percentage point more than in the baseline, reaching about 3 percent in 2020. Because
policymakers revise their view of the natural rate downward only gradually, the gap
between the unemployment rate and the perceived natural rate is larger, albeit by a small
amount, than in the baseline. With inflation only a touch lower and the perceived output
gap not much different from the baseline, the path for the federal funds rate is little
changed. Had policymakers fully and immediately recognized the lower natural rate, the
perceived output gap would have been substantially smaller and the federal funds rate
would have been about ¼ percentage point lower during the first two years of the
simulation. The unemployment rate would have fallen ¾ percentage point below the
baseline in 2020, ¼ percentage point further than in the case of misperception.
6 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential
output, the federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching almost
5¼ percent by the end of 2021. In that case, the effect of positive hysteresis on the unemployment rate is
about half of that under this scenario.

Heightened Risk of Euro-Area Breakup [SIGMA]
y
t
n In our baseline, we marked down the outlook for euro-area growth on the
ai
t
r assumption that ongoing political uncertainty in Italy will generate moderate financial
e
c
n stresses in other euro-area countries. Our scenario considers a substantially worse
U
&
outcome in which a populist government steers Italy on a course that threatens its
s
k
s solvency or its continued membership in the euro area. By weakening investor
Ri
confidence in European institutions and causing anxiety about a possible breakup of the
euro area, these developments plunge the euro area into a prolonged period of financial
stress, flagging confidence, and recession. While we assume that financial markets
gradually recover after the Italian government reverses course and the EU authorities take
forceful policy actions, the crisis nonetheless has sizable adverse spillovers to the United
States and the rest of the world.
Specifically, our scenario assumes that euro-area GDP falls about 4 percent below
the baseline by the end of 2019 as both sovereign and private credit conditions tighten
dramatically, though somewhat less than during the 2011–12 European debt crisis, and
household and business confidence declines. Investment-grade U.S. corporate bond
spreads rise about 75 basis points, flight-to-safety flows boost the trade-weighted dollar
10 percent above its baseline path, and the term premium on long-term U.S. Treasury
securities declines 30 basis points. Financial conditions also tighten markedly in
economies outside Europe and the United States.
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall
relative to the baseline, while lower confidence and tighter financial conditions in the
United States depress domestic demand. All told, U.S. real GDP expands only
1¼ percent in the second half of 2018 and 1½ percent in 2019. The U.S. unemployment
rate is about ¾ percentage point higher than in the baseline in late 2019 and remains
above the baseline through 2022. Lower resource utilization and falling import prices
reduce U.S. core PCE inflation to about 1¼ percent by 2019. The federal funds rate
follows a shallower path, about 1 percentage point below the baseline on average from
2019 to 2021.
EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar [SIGMA]
In our baseline, we continue to expect solid growth in most EMEs despite some
increases in financial stresses. Even so, EMEs face a number of vulnerabilities, including

high sovereign and private debt, that may be exacerbated by ongoing U.S. monetary
y
policy normalization, especially if investor confidence is weakened by heightening n t
ai
geopolitical risks, rising trade tensions, or political uncertainties. In this scenario, we t
r
e
c
assume that EME economies experience a broad-based deterioration of financial n
U
conditions that is accompanied by substantial capital outflows and currency depreciation, &
s
generating sizable adverse spillovers to the United States and advanced foreign k
s
Ri
economies.
Specifically, this scenario assumes that declining confidence fuels an ongoing
flight from EME assets, causing credit spreads to widen substantially and EME
currencies to depreciate sharply. Flight-to-safety flows into dollar-denominated assets
reduce the term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities 30 basis points and cause corporate
bond spreads to rise 50 basis points both in the United States and in the advanced foreign
economies. All told, foreign GDP growth runs ¾ percentage point below the baseline in
2019, while the broad real dollar appreciates by 10 percent.
Weaker foreign activity, the appreciation of the dollar, and tighter financial
conditions restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States. U.S. GDP
growth moderates to 1¾ percent in 2019, about ¾ percentage point less than in the
baseline. Core PCE inflation is still below 2 percent in 2019, about ¼ percentage point
lower than the baseline. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in
the baseline.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals Ri s
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y
t intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. The near-term prescriptions are little changed from
those in the previous Tealbook. Over the medium term, the Tealbook baseline projection
features somewhat lower levels of resource utilization, on average, than the projection
completed in April. Consequently, the prescriptions arising from most of the strategies
are slightly more accommodative than those in the previous Tealbook. In the box
“Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies,” we explore the economic
consequences of a change in policy strategy when the public is uncertain about
policymakers’ reaction function and has to learn about the new policy strategy over time.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the “balanced
approach” rule), the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and a flexible price-level
targeting (FPLT) rule. These near-term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown by the black lines in the middle
panels, and for the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate of
unemployment (not shown). The top and middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline
path for the federal funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor
(1999) rule.1
Here and in the simple policy rule simulations, we have replaced the nominal
income targeting (NIT) rule that has appeared in past Tealbooks with one of the FPLT
rules discussed in the April Tealbook.2 Like the nominal income targeting rule, the FPLT
rule aims to reverse past deviations of inflation from policymakers’ objective rather than
letting “bygones be bygones.” However, it differs from the NIT rule by specifying that
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Except for the
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that
are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.
2 In the April Tealbook, this rule was featured in the special exhibit of the Monetary Policy
Strategies (MPS) section under the name “FPLT, equal responses (2011:Q4).” This rule has also been
analyzed in the research literature (for example, Chung and others, 2015).

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the March 2018 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r*.

the federal funds rate reacts to the unemployment rate gap and a price gap defined using
the core PCE price index, rather than the output gap and a price gap defined using the
GDP deflator.3 The FPLT rule we consider uses equal coefficients on the unemployment
and price gaps and has the same degree of interest rate inertia as the inertial Taylor
(1999) rule used in the Tealbook baseline.4 Like the NIT rule that preceded it, the FPLT
rule uses a target path for prices that equals the actual price level in 2011:Q4—which is
the quarter just before the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation objective—and
that rises at a 2 percent annual rate thereafter.
• The staff forecast for the variables that enter these rules has changed very
little; consequently, the prescriptions of the policy rules are nearly the same as
in the April Tealbook.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.
• Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call for raising
the federal funds rate in the near term, the FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate
the shortfall in the core PCE price index of about 2½ percent, prescribes levels
for the federal funds rate in the second and third quarters that remain within
the current target range.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook
3 The use of the core PCE price index in the rule is consistent with the other rules in the MPS
section that respond to core PCE inflation. If the rule responded to the headline PCE price level, then the
rule would prescribe more volatile policy rates. Moreover, in the event of an increase in oil prices, such a
rule would prescribe higher policy rates in order to offset the effect of this increase on the aggregate price
level, thereby reducing aggregate demand to put downward pressure on non-oil prices.
4 The sensitivity of the FPLT rule to the cyclical position of the economy is similar to the Taylor
(1993) rule. The FRB/US model roughly satisfies the empirical regularity known as Okun’s law by
generating changes in the unemployment gap that are roughly half as large and of the opposite sign as
changes in the output gap. Hence, a coefficient of negative 1 on the unemployment gap (as in the FPLT
rule) has implications similar to those of a coefficient of 0.5 on the output gap (as in the Taylor
(1993) rule).

baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March 2018 Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP).5 In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used
to generate an estimate of r*. This r* concept, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in
the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real
economy; because it is based on a single criterion, it does not take into account other
considerations, such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the
federal funds rate.

averages almost 1 percentage point lower than the corresponding path in the
Tealbook.
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US

5 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the March 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth
and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the
SEP. For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.6 The
simulations for each rule are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers commit
to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and
wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this
commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the macroeconomy.
The exhibit also reports the extended Tealbook baseline projection.
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate rises to about 2½ percent
by the end of this year. Over the subsequent two years, it increases by about
1 percentage point per year, bringing the rate to slightly above 4½ percent in
the fourth quarter of 2020.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding
Tealbook baseline values through early 2022. This higher path is associated
with only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10-year Treasury yield than
in the baseline through the middle of 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter,
as the Taylor (1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds
rate for a sustained period later in the simulation period. Because wage and
price setting today is influenced by expected future outcomes in FRB/US, and
because the Taylor (1999) rule calls for somewhat more accommodative
policy later in the simulation, current inflation is a touch higher than in the
baseline projection. The path for the unemployment rate lies above the
Tealbook baseline path over the next few years, but subsequently takes a bit
longer to return to its natural rate. In the box “Learning and Misperceptions
of Policy Strategies,” we examine the implications for macroeconomic
outcomes of departing from the assumption that the public immediately
understand the new policy in the context of this simulation.
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate. Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to
projected output exceeding its assumed potential level, the prescriptions of
this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown.
6 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in
the top panel of the first exhibit.

Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies
In the simple policy rule simulations reported in this Tealbook, the Taylor (1999) rule initially
raises the federal funds rate more than 220 basis points above the Tealbook baseline.
Despite this abrupt tightening, inflation is higher than in the Tealbook baseline, and the
unemployment rate rises only modestly above the Tealbook baseline. These counterintuitive
outcomes arise because financial market participants as well as price and wage setters are
assumed to have model-consistent expectations (MCE): They immediately recognize how the
policy rule has changed and perfectly anticipate the more accommodative policy that the
Taylor (1999) rule prescribes in later years in the simulation.
In this discussion, we consider the alternative assumption that the public only gradually
s
e comes to understand a change in policy strategy. Specifically, we assume that the public is
gi
initially uncertain about the parameters of the new policy rule and that their beliefs about
e
a t likely parameter values evolve over time through a process of learning from the observed
r
t values of the federal funds rate and information about the state of the economy.1 In the
S
y short run there can be misperceptions about the new policy strategy. The economic
c
li outcomes associated with changes in the monetary policy rule under learning can be
o
P considerably different from those under MCE.
y
r
a
e t We illustrate how this learning process can affect economic outcomes using a scenario in
n
o which policymakers initially follow the prescriptions of the inertial version of the Taylor (1999)
M
rule, as in the Tealbook baseline, and then in the third quarter of 2018 switch to the non-
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. We carry out three sets of simulations using the
small FRB/US (sFRB) model.2 In the first simulation, the public has model-consistent
expectations and thus immediately understands the properties of the new policy rule. In the
second and third simulations, the public does not directly observe how the policy rule has
changed and is uncertain about the smoothing coefficient on the lagged federal funds rate as
well as the value of the intercept term in the rule. 3 Beliefs about the intercept capture a
variety of reasons the public might believe the FOMC to be undertaking a persistent deviation
from the policy rule, including changes in policymakers’ assessment of the equilibrium real
federal funds rate or the inflation target. The two learning simulations differ only in their
assumptions about the public’s initial or prior beliefs about the relative likelihood of different
kinds of policy changes.
Figure 1 shows the evolution of the economy in the scenario under MCE and under learning,
along with the Tealbook baseline. The simulation under MCE is virtually identical to the one
for the Taylor (1999) rule shown earlier in the Monetary Policy Strategies section, which uses

2 sFRB is a simplified, linear version of FRB/US designed to mimic its properties for a small set of key
variables. Under MCE, the simulations carried out in FRB/US and sFRB are very similar.
3 For simplicity, we assume that the public knows the true rule parameters with certainty until 2018:Q2
and remains certain throughout the simulation about the response coefficients on inflation and the output
gap. The values of these two coefficients are the same in both rules considered here.

the full FRB/US model. Despite an immediate and sharp tightening in which the federal funds
rate jumps above 4 percent, inflation runs slightly higher under the Taylor (1999) rule than
the inertial version of the rule.
By contrast, in the simulation labeled “Learning (less informed prior),” switching to the non-
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule induces a large fall in inflation; moreover, inflation
remains below the Committee’s 2 percent objective through 2022. At the same time, the
unemployment rate increases by more than under MCE. This difference in economic
outcomes under learning stems from the way in which the public interprets the large and
unexpected increase in the federal funds rate in 2018:Q3.4 In the near term, in this simulation,
the public attributes the sharp increase in the federal funds rate partly to a lower value of the
smoothing coefficient in the policy rule, but also partly to a higher value of the intercept. As a
result of this misperception, the public anticipates a significant and sustained tightening of
policy. These expectations of tighter policy are reflected in a large run-up in the real 10-year
Treasury yield that persists for several quarters.
Figure 2 illustrates the misperception about the future policy path. The figure shows paths
for the real federal funds rate as expected by the public as of selected dates, as well as the
realized path of the federal funds rate. In 2018:Q3, the public anticipates a path for the real
federal funds rate that is considerably higher than the realized path. This divergence of
anticipated and realized paths occurs because, as noted above, the public misinterprets the
removal of policy inertia as an increase in the intercept that leads to persistently tighter
policy. In contrast, the actual path of the federal funds rate realized under the Taylor (1999)
rule lies below the corresponding path under MCE because the rule reacts to the fall in
inflation and resource utilization caused by the public’s misperceptions.
Over time, the public revises its perception of the policy rule in light of how policy actions
respond to economic outcomes and adjusts its estimates of the intercept and the smoothing
coefficient. The perceived parameters of the policy rule gradually move toward their true
values. In figure 1, the economy gradually converges to its path under MCE. In figure 2,
anticipated and realized policy paths converge.
In a situation in which the federal funds rate is changed by a historically large amount,
predicting how the public will form its expectations is ultimately a speculative exercise. The
simulation just described represents only one of many plausible outcomes. In particular, the
effects of learning depend on the public’s initial or prior beliefs about the predictability of
policymakers’ actions. To illustrate this point, we conduct an alternative simulation labeled
“Learning (more informed prior),” where the public is assumed to believe that changes in the
intercept term of the rule are less likely, and changes in the smoothing coefficient are more
likely, than in the previous simulation. These prior beliefs are closer to the actual change in
the policy strategy, and, in this sense, are more informed. As a result, misperceptions about
the future path of policy are smaller, and economic outcomes in figure 1 are more similar to
those obtained under MCE.
4 The state of the economy at the time of the announcement greatly influences the extent to which
learning affects economic outcomes when the rule is changed. In a situation in which the inertial and the
non-inertial versions of the Taylor (1999) rule both prescribed similar values, announcing a change from the
former to the latter rule would lead to only minor changes in the observed path of the federal funds rate.
Accordingly, allowing for learning would have only minor effects on economic outcomes.

The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook
baseline over the next two years, though, starting in the third quarter of 2020,
the path for the federal funds rate falls below the baseline path for a sustained
period. As a result, current inflation is higher, and the real 10-year Treasury
yield is lower, than their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.
The more accommodative conditions engender a more pronounced
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate beyond the
medium term.
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first-difference rule is
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through 2020, but runs
below the baseline path for some years thereafter. The latter divergence
occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to projected output
exceeding its assumed potential level by progressively smaller amounts
beyond the next three years. The associated lower path of the federal funds
rate, in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies
lower longer-term real interest rates than in the Tealbook baseline. Thus, the
first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are
lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than the corresponding
outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection.
• The FPLT rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of core PCE
inflation from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011. The FPLT
rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate below 1¾ percent until the third
quarter of 2019, and maintaining a markedly slower pace of increases
thereafter than in the Tealbook baseline. This prescription generates a higher
rate of inflation in coming years that eventually undoes the 2½ percent
shortfall of the core PCE price index relative to a path that rises 2 percent per
year beginning in 2011:Q4.7 Because the simulation embeds the assumptions
that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly
anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates, the path of the
7 Using the headline measure of PCE prices, the 2018:Q1 price-level gap is about 4 percent,
1.5 percentage points larger than the gap based on core PCE prices. Accordingly, a rule that responded to
headline PCE prices rather than to core PCE prices would prescribe an even more accommodative policy.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

real 10-year Treasury rate drops below the Tealbook baseline for the next five
years. The unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook
baseline and all other simulations shown, dropping below 2½ percent
in 2021.8
• Compared with the April Tealbook, the prescriptions of the simple rules are
around ¼ percentage point lower by the end of 2021.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.9
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.10
The first three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection, for two reasons. First,
high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up
to its natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the
unemployment rate does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the
FRB/US model. Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood
and fully credible, the front-loading of policy tightening is not disruptive. In practice,
however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as high and as quickly as
prescribed by the first three optimal control policies, macroeconomic outcomes could be
less benign than shown here because of the confusion and financial market disruption that
such an abrupt change in policy might engender.11 In contrast, the fourth optimal control
8 The unemployment rate subsequently rises to a level near its natural rate in 2031, while core PCE
inflation falls from a peak of 2.3 percent in 2020 to 2 percent in 2031.
9 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
10 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.
11 The simulation results hinge on the assumptions that agents in the model have perfect foresight
and are certain that policymakers will implement the prescribed path for the federal funds rate. We discuss
an alternative assumption about expectations using simple policy rules in the box “Learning and
Misperceptions of Policy Strategies.”

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels last experienced during the
1950s. Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those
predicted by the simulations.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable
undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate over the next
several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with
the equal-weights loss function judge to be costly.12 The small projected
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates only
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response of
inflation to the level of resource utilization is limited.
• The second simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical to that specification. Even though the losses associated with
undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years, the resulting
optimal strategy is only marginally more accommodative than in the “Equal
weights” case, for two reasons. First, inflation is already close to the
Committee’s 2 percent objective. Second, in the FRB/US model,
policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds only
weakly to resource utilization.
• The third simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate
12 When we use the March 2018 SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5 percent, compared
with about 8 percent under the Tealbook baseline.

but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. This
simulation seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even faster
than under the equal-weights specification. As a result, the federal funds rate
soars above 11 percent at the end of 2018 and then averages around 7 percent
from 2020 through 2023.
• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but the loss
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the
s

elevated resource utilization.
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rule and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a small
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

level, , and the log of the target price-level path, . The 2011:Q4 value of the target path is set

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price gap like the FPLT rule
have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1 An FPLT rule similar to the one
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and chosen
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objectiv𝐿𝐿e𝐿𝐿 and an equilibrium real
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.2 The prescriptions 𝑟𝑟 of the first-difference rule
do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
1 For applications, see, for example, Erceg and others (2012).
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and
then converted to a 360-day basis.

and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT

unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate. The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights

the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
