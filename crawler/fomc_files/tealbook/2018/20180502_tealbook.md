Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&

The information received since the March Tealbook remains consistent with our D
n
view that the economy continues to expand at an above-trend pace. Although the March o
c
E
employment report was not as strong as we had expected, our broad assessment is that c
ti
s
labor market conditions continued to tighten through the first quarter: The e
m
unemployment rate remained flat, but the labor force participation rate (LFPR) moved up o
D
and payroll employment gains averaged well above the pace estimated to be consistent
with no change in resource utilization. On the spending side, GDP growth appears to
have slowed in the first quarter, but we judge that the slowdown is temporary and expect
that GDP growth will bounce back in the current quarter. Over the first half of the year,
real GDP is projected to increase at an annual rate of 2¼ percent, about ¼ percentage
point less than we had forecast in the March Tealbook but sufficient to further widen the
gap between actual and potential output.
Over the medium term, we continue to project an economy with above-trend
growth and very high resource utilization, buoyed by expansionary fiscal policy and solid
foreign growth. We forecast that real GDP will increase about 2½ percent this year and
next before slowing to a 2 percent pace in 2020 as monetary policy continues to tighten.
By the end of the medium term, the level of real GDP is projected to be 3¼ percent above
our estimate of its potential—nearly ½ percentage point less than in our previous forecast
but still indicative of a very tight economy. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate is
expected to be 3.3 percent at the end of 2020—a little higher than in the March Tealbook
but still 1½ percentage points below our estimate of its natural rate.
The latest monthly readings on prices have come in a touch above our
expectations and provide additional support for our view that the factors that held down
inflation last year were transitory. With the March CPI and PPI now in hand, we estimate
that the 12-month change in core PCE prices stepped up to 1.9 percent last month,
0.1 percentage point above our March Tealbook projection, as the extraordinarily low
reading from March of last year dropped out of the calculation. For the year as a whole,
we expect core inflation to be 2.0 percent—also 0.1 percentage point higher than in our
previous forecast. Core inflation is then projected to edge up to 2.1 percent in 2019 and
2020 as resource utilization tightens further and underlying inflation inches up. Total
PCE prices are expected to increase 2.1 percent this year, a little more than core prices,

D
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is ¼ percentage point lower than the
n
o
projections from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip
c
E
consensus in 2018 and ¼ percentage point higher than the Blue Chip in 2019. The
c
s
ti
staff’s unemployment rate forecast is below the outside forecasts in both 2018 and
e
m 2019. The staff’s projections for total CPI and PCE inflation are a little higher than the
o
D outside forecasts in 2018 but are about the same in 2019, while the staff forecast for
core PCE inflation is a touch higher than the SPF in both years. (Note that the SPF
projections are more than two months old.)

boosted by an increase in energy prices in the first half of the year. After this year, total t l
u
O
inflation—at 1.9 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020—is restrained a bit by declining
&
energy prices and runs a little below core inflation. Relative to the March Tealbook, e l
v
e
inflation at the end of the projection is a touch lower, reflecting the higher unemployment D

rate in this forecast. Finally, as in the March Tealbook, we have not incorporated any o
c
E
effects on either real activity or inflation from higher import tariffs.1 c

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS o
D
Fiscal Policy
• We have not changed our fiscal policy assumptions in this projection. We still
estimate that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government will
boost aggregate demand growth ½ percentage point in 2018, ¾ percentage
point in 2019, and ½ percentage point in 2020, exclusive of any multiplier
effects and offsets from reactions in interest rates and the dollar. Roughly
one-half of that medium-term impetus is due to the recent federal tax cuts,
while about one-fourth reflects the recent federal spending legislation; most of
the remainder is due to projected increases in real state and local government
expenditures.
• The federal deficit is projected to rise from 3½ percent of GDP in fiscal year
2017 to 5¼ percent in fiscal 2020—a step-up that primarily reflects the effects
of the recent tax and spending bills.
We continue to assume that, in five years, confronted with an elevated and
o
rising debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal policymakers will begin to enact deficit
reduction measures that gradually bring annual deficits back to sustainable
levels.
Monetary Policy
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use to set the path of
monetary policy calls for the federal funds rate to increase nearly
1½ percentage points in total this year and to rise about 1 percentage point per
year, on average, in the next two years, reaching 4.7 percent in the fourth
1 We estimate that the effects of the new steel and aluminum tariffs, in isolation, will be minimal
for both net exports and prices. Other potential tariff changes remain highly uncertain at this point and are
therefore not included in our projection.

t l quarter of 2020. This trajectory is a little less steep than in the March
u
O
Tealbook, primarily reflecting the slightly lower level of resource utilization
&
e l in this projection.
v
e
D
n • The SOMA portfolio continues to shrink as securities are redeemed in a
o
c
E manner consistent with the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum to the Policy
c
ti
s Normalization Principles and Plans and with the process initiated in
e
m
October 2017.
o
D
Other Interest Rates
• The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly over the medium
term from an average of 2.9 percent in the current quarter to 4.4 percent by the
end of 2020. This path has been revised down about 25 basis points on
average relative to the March Tealbook, reflecting the lower-than-expected
readings for the 10-year Treasury yield over the intermeeting period along
with the flatter projected trajectory for the federal funds rate.
• The 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond rate are also
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term. The paths for these two
rates were revised down mostly in line with revisions to the path of the
10-year Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
• Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter 1½ percent lower than
was projected in the March Tealbook, reflecting the recent declines in broad
equity price indexes. Beyond the current quarter, we project stock prices to
rise at an average annual rate of ¾ percent, similar to our previous projection.
• We expect annual house price appreciation to slow from 6 percent last year to
an average of about 3¾ percent over the next three years, as interest rates rise.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
• We estimate that real GDP in the foreign economies rose 3 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter, a touch faster than in the second half of last
year. This first-quarter estimate is about the same as in the March Tealbook,
as softer economic indicators in some advanced foreign economies were about
offset by positive surprises in several Asian economies. Foreign growth is

o
projected to stay close to this 3 percent pace in 2018 and then edge down t l
u
O
slightly over the remainder of the forecast period to near its potential rate of
&
2¾ percent in 2020. e l
v
e
D
• The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about ½ percent since the time of n
o
c
the March Tealbook. We project the broad real dollar to appreciate at an E
c
ti
annual rate of about 1¾ percent through the forecast period, as market s
e
m
expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast. This
o
D
rate of appreciation is somewhat lower than in the March projection, reflecting
the downward revision of the staff’s projected path for U.S. policy rates. This
lower rate of projected appreciation, along with the recent realized
depreciation, leaves the broad real dollar about 1¼ percent lower at the end of
the forecast relative to the March Tealbook.
Oil and Commodity Prices
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen $9 per barrel on net since the
March Tealbook, closing most recently at $73 per barrel, while the price of
the December 2020 futures contract rose $4 to $61 per barrel. The increase in
oil prices, especially in the near term, is primarily attributable to heightened
geopolitical risk following recent events in Syria as well as increased tensions
between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Informed by both the futures market and our
forecast of an appreciating dollar, our forecast for the price of imported oil has
been revised up $7 in the near term to $65 per barrel; thereafter, we expect oil
prices to decline about $12 over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching
$53 per barrel by the end of 2020, only $2 higher than in our March Tealbook
forecast.
• Metals prices have moved up since the March Tealbook. The largest
increases were seen for aluminum, with prices up 21 percent since our March
projection, largely in response to U.S. sanctions on Russia that targeted one of
the world’s largest aluminum producers.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
We estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the first
quarter after rising 3 percent in the fourth quarter; this deceleration is more than

accounted for by a marked slowdown in real PCE growth.2 We see the soft PCE reading t l
u
O
in the first quarter as mostly temporary and project real GDP growth to move back up to
&
a 3 percent pace this quarter. GDP growth over the first half of the year is about e l
v
e
¼ percentage point less than in the March Tealbook but still faster than its trend pace. D
n
Similarly, the recent labor market data, on balance, suggest that resource utilization has o
c
E
continued to tighten, though by a little less than we had anticipated at the time of the c
ti
s
March Tealbook. All told, we project that output will be 1¾ percent above its potential e
m
level in the current quarter—about ¼ percentage point lower than we had previously o
D
forecast. For the second half of the year, real GDP is projected to rise at an annual rate of
about 3 percent; this rate is also a little lower than in the March Tealbook, largely
reflecting a somewhat slower pace of PCE growth due to weaker incoming indicators of
disposable income.3
• After increasing at a 4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, real PCE
appears to have risen only 1¼ percent in the first quarter—about ¼ percentage
point less than we had anticipated in the March Tealbook.4 We continue to
believe that most of the weakness in first-quarter consumption growth reflects
payback for the exceptionally strong fourth-quarter growth and, therefore, see
the slowdown last quarter as mostly transitory. Correspondingly, we
anticipate that PCE growth will step up to a 2¼ percent pace in the current
quarter and then to 2½ percent in the second half, supported by continued job
gains and the boost to disposable income from the recently implemented
personal income tax cuts and consistent with positive readings on consumer
sentiment.
2 The BEA’s first estimate of GDP growth for 2018:Q1 will be released on Friday, April 27,
before the FOMC meeting.
3 Incoming data on tax collections and transfer payments point to lower disposable income than
we had previously expected, which restrains projected PCE growth throughout the year. (The tax receipts
in the incoming data were stronger than anticipated, which could instead be interpreted as a signal of
stronger income; however, those receipts often fail to track measured income closely at monthly or
quarterly frequencies.) These incoming receipts data are unrelated to the effect of the recently enacted
tax cuts.
4 March retail sales came in weaker than we anticipated. We were expecting a strong rebound in
March because we judged that February retail sales had been held down by a timing shift of income tax
refunds to EITC claimants in that month. We have interpreted some of the March miss as indicating a
smaller and more delayed effect on spending from the timing shift of tax refunds than we had originally
assumed. Accordingly, we took a little bit of signal from the negative surprise for the pace of consumer
spending and nudged down projected PCE growth in the second quarter.

about 6 percent in the first quarter, close to last year’s pace. We expect

o • Residential investment is projected to edge lower, on net, over the first half of
D
the year. Smoothing through the considerable volatility in these expenditures,
we anticipate that housing investment will increase a modest 1 percent this
year, held back by rising mortgage rates and a constrained supply of
construction workers and developable lots.
• We expect real government purchases to be flat, on net, over the first half of
this year and then to rise at a 2½ percent pace over the second half of the year.
The acceleration in these purchases largely reflects the recent federal budget
legislation.
• After being surprisingly weak for much of last year, imports jumped in the
fourth quarter and are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of
5¼ percent in the first quarter. Recent import growth has been broad based,
leading us to expect the level of imports to remain elevated. Net exports are
now anticipated to subtract 0.2 percentage point from real GDP growth in the
first half of the year, compared with a small positive contribution projected in
the March Tealbook.
• Manufacturing production increased at a solid annual rate of about 3 percent
in the first quarter. Although the national and regional new orders indexes
have moved down a bit in recent months, they remain consistent with
continued expansion in this sector. Accordingly, we expect that
manufacturing output will expand at a moderate pace of about 2½ percent in
the current quarter.
Over the medium term, we project that real GDP growth will slow from about
2½ percent this year and next to 2 percent in 2020, as monetary policy continues to
tighten. GDP growth over the next few years is supported by expansionary fiscal policy
and solid foreign growth.

• Compared with the March Tealbook, our forecast for real GDP growth beyond t l
u
O
2018 is unchanged, as revisions to conditioning assumptions have been
&

offsetting. In particular, the negative effects of the lower trajectory of equity e

prices and higher oil prices are offset by the positive effects of the lower D

• Real GDP growth is projected to outpace potential growth throughout the s
e
m
medium term, resulting in a further tightening of resource utilization. At the
o
D
end of 2020, real GDP exceeds its potential level by 3¼ percent—nearly
½ percentage point less than in the March Tealbook but still indicative of a
very tight economy.
• Given the high degree of resource utilization in this projection, we continue to
assume that supply constraints will begin to attenuate the transmission of
increased aggregate demand into increased output and will contribute to
slightly higher consumer price inflation and wage growth over the medium
term. With the small downward revision to aggregate demand in this forecast,
we now project these supply constraints to be a little less binding than in the
March Tealbook.
• With the federal government expected to run historically large and rising
deficits over the medium term, national saving is projected to trend downward
as a share of GDP. Nevertheless, private investment trends upward as a share
of the economy, with the gap between domestic investment and national
saving financed by inflows of foreign capital.
• The box “Tealbook Forecast Errors: An Update through 2017” reviews recent
errors in the staff’s forecast for GDP, unemployment, and inflation. (In the
Risks and Uncertainty section, we include a related box reviewing the recent
performance of the FRB/US and EDO models.)
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
Although the March employment report was not as strong as we had expected, our
broad assessment is that the labor market continued to tighten in the first quarter.
• Total nonfarm payrolls rose 103,000 in March after jumping 326,000 in
February. For the first quarter as a whole, payrolls increased at an average

O Tealbook Forecast Errors: An Update through 2017
&
l
e
v Real activity in 2017 was somewhat stronger than anticipated by Tealbook
e
D forecasts, although the staff’s forecast errors were generally small by historical
n
o standards. Real GDP grew at a slightly faster pace than the staff forecast one and
c
E two years ago, and the unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2017 than
c
ti expected. Despite the unexpected strength of real activity, core PCE price
s
e inflation last year was a bit lower than anticipated.
m
o
D
The figure on the next page shows data and Tealbook forecasts for four economic
variables: real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total and core PCE price
inflation. For example, the gray bars in the upper-left panel show the currently
published Q4/Q4 percent changes in real GDP from 2014 to 2017. The blue squares
show Tealbook forecasts for GDP growth made in the April Tealbook one year
earlier; green triangles show the forecast from the April Tealbook of the
contemporaneous year. The whisker bands demarcate 70 percent forecast error
bands, and the top edge of a gray bar falling outside of the whisker band
represents an unusually large forecast error.1 The red dots are BEA estimates of
real GDP growth from mid-April of the subsequent year, and the red 70 percent
bands show the magnitude of revisions to that estimate relative to the BEA’s
current estimate.
Real GDP growth in 2017 is currently estimated to be 2.6 percent, higher than
Tealbook forecasts from April 2016 and April 2017 (2.4 percent and 2.0 percent,
respectively). These forecast errors, however, are historically small, with real GDP
well within the 70 percent whisker bands. A possible explanation for faster-than-
expected real GDP growth last year is that financial conditions were more
supportive of economic growth. For example, the April 2017 Tealbook projected
the 10-year Treasury yield to be 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of that year,
whereas the 10-year yield averaged only 2.4 percent in 2017:Q4. Likewise, equity
prices ended 2017 roughly 10 percent higher, and investment-grade corporate
bond spreads were narrower, than projected by the staff that April.
Consistent with faster-than-expected real GDP growth last year, labor market
conditions improved more than anticipated. As seen in the top-right panel, the
unemployment rate ended the year at a lower level than the staff had forecast.
Because the April 2017 Tealbook forecast of the labor force participation rate was
on the mark, the greater-than-expected improvement in the labor market is also
reflected in the employment-to-population ratio and private-sector job gains, both
of which were higher in 2017 than was forecast in April (not shown).
The bottom row of the figure shows staff forecasts for total and core PCE price
inflation and their confidence intervals, alongside the latest estimates. Even
1 The whisker bands for real activity variables are calculated using Tealbook forecast errors
since 1980; whisker bands around the inflation projections use forecast errors since 1998.

though the forecast errors for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate O
suggest that the economy tightened more than the staff expected last year, staff &
l
forecasts of the Q4/Q4 percent change in core PCE prices in 2017 were a little too e
v
high, as shown in the bottom-right panel. The error in forecasting core PCE price e
D
inflation is entirely explained by lower-than-expected core goods prices, which fell n
o
notably again last year despite a pickup in core goods import price inflation.2 In c
E
contrast, the staff’s projection of total PCE price inflation in 2017 was accurate, as c
ti
higher-than-expected PCE energy prices in the last few months of the year offset e s
m
lower-than-expected food and core goods prices.
o
D
Finally, the faster-than-expected fall in the unemployment rate occurred at the
same time that core PCE price inflation was lower than the staff could explain. In
response, the staff edged down its estimate of the natural rate of unemployment
last year, 0.2 percentage point cumulatively.

to wireless telephone services prices seen in the March 2017 CPI release.

• The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent for a sixth consecutive month in
e
m
March. In recent months, the unemployment rate has surprised us a little to
o
D
the upside. In response, we have raised our near-term projection of the jobless
rate a bit and now expect the unemployment rate to be 4.0 percent in the
current quarter and 3.8 percent next quarter; both rates are 0.1 percentage
point higher than in our previous forecast.
• The LFPR ticked down in March but has generally surprised us to the upside
in recent months. For the past few years, the participation rate has moved
essentially sideways, on net, indicating some tightening along this margin
relative to its declining trend.
We continue to expect the labor market to tighten further over the medium term in
line with above-trend GDP growth.
• Total payroll gains are projected to slow gradually from an average monthly
pace of about 195,000 this year to 160,000 in 2020, as GDP decelerates; this
trajectory is a touch lower than in our previous forecast.
• We project the unemployment rate to decline ½ percentage point this year—
similar to its decline in 2017—and to reach 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter,
0.1 percentage point above our previous projection. The jobless rate moves
down further in 2019, ending the year at 3.3 percent, and then moves sideways
in 2020. The projected unemployment rate at the end of 2020 is
0.2 percentage point higher than in our March Tealbook projection, consistent
with the somewhat narrower output gap at the end of the medium term.
5 This range assumes that the LFPR declines in line with the staff’s estimate of its trend. With an
unchanged participation rate, the pace of monthly job gains required to keep the unemployment rate
constant ranges from 130,000 to 160,000.

• The LFPR is projected to end this year at 62.7 percent and then move t l
u
O
sideways through 2020, as sustained job gains and rising real wages continue
&
l
to draw individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows. At the e
v
e
end of 2020, the LFPR is 0.6 percentage point above our estimate of its trend D
n
and unchanged from the March Tealbook. o

• We have continued to assume that, in an extremely tight labor market, a s
e
m
larger-than-usual amount of the tightening in resource utilization over the
o
D
medium term will manifest in a higher LFPR and workweek rather than in a
lower unemployment rate.6
• We project that labor productivity in the business sector will increase an
average of about 1 percent per year over the forecast period—a touch faster
than its average pace over the past five years, though somewhat less than our
estimate of its structural pace.7
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
The incoming information on prices has been consistent with our view that
transitory factors held down inflation last year and that inflation is moving up this year.
On balance, the latest news on prices has been a touch higher than we anticipated.
• With the March CPI and PPI now in hand and with the low March 2017
reading dropping out of the calculation, we estimate that the 12-month change
in core PCE prices stepped up to 1.9 percent last month, 0.1 percentage point
higher than we had projected in the March Tealbook. We expect the
12-month change to edge up to 2.1 percent by June, also a little higher than in
the March Tealbook.
• We now estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months
ending in March, and we expect the 12-month change to move up to
2.5 percent by June. Total PCE price inflation is higher than core inflation,
6 Were we to maintain our usual Okun’s law relationship, the unemployment rate at the end of the
projection would be ¼ percentage point lower.
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes
tight, possibly because workers hired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to
workers hired during a slack labor market.

recent declines in the dollar and consistent with the incoming trade price data. E

We project core import price inflation to slow to a 1¼ percent pace in the s
e
m
second half and to about ½ percent in 2019 and 2020, in line with moderate
o
D
foreign inflation, a gradually appreciating dollar, and slowly declining
commodity prices.
• Incoming data on longer-term inflation expectations have moved little, on
balance, since the March Tealbook. Median expectations over the next 5 to
10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were
unchanged at 2.5 percent in March and edged down to 2.4 percent in the
preliminary April reading, close to where they have been over the past couple
of years. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer
Expectations reported that the median inflation expectation 3 years ahead was
unchanged in March at 2.9 percent. Finally, the TIPS-based measure of 5-to-
10-year-forward inflation compensation edged up since the March meeting
and stands at 2.2 percent.
Core PCE price inflation is on track to rise to 2.0 percent in 2018, as the transitory
factors that had been suppressing inflation last year abate and resource utilization
continues to tighten. Core inflation then edges up to 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020, as the
further tightening of the economy and a gradual increase in our judgmental underlying
inflation trend more than offset restraint from the projected deceleration in core import
prices.
• With oil prices expected to edge lower over the medium term, we project total
PCE price inflation to run a bit below core inflation after this year and to be
2.0 percent in 2020.
• Relative to the March Tealbook, the medium-term forecasts for both core and
total PCE price inflation have revised down a touch, reflecting the slightly
lower degree of resource utilization in this projection. Nonetheless, we
continue to assume that the supply constraints that attenuate the transmission

m • Average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the year ending in March, close

D
to our estimate in the March Tealbook. We expect the 12-month change in
average hourly earnings to remain close to this pace through the summer.
• The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker ticked up to
3.3 percent in March, near the middle of its range over the past couple of
years but up from before then.
• Over the medium term, growth in compensation per hour (CPH) is projected
to step up from a pace of 3½ percent this year to around 4 percent in each of
the next two years, as resource utilization tightens further. Meanwhile, the
ECI, which is notably less cyclical than the CPH measure, steps up from a
2½ percent pace this year to 2¾ percent in 2019 and 2020. Compared with
the March Tealbook, these projections are revised down a little, reflecting the
slightly lower level of resource utilization in this forecast.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be
4.7 percent, and that potential output growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the
longer run.
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. Yields on 10-year
Treasury securities in the longer run are assumed to stand at 3.4 percent.
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing

• PCE price inflation hovers around 2.1 percent in 2022 and 2023 before edging
back down to the Committee’s long-run objective in later years.
• With output materially above its potential level and inflation slightly above
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to
about 5 percent at the end of 2021—2½ percentage points higher than its
assumed long-run value. Thereafter, the federal funds rate moves gradually
back toward its long-run value.

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The foreign economies appear set for another year of strong growth in 2018, with
growth projected to be close to 3 percent, virtually unchanged from 2017. In the
advanced foreign economies (AFEs), we estimate that, after growing a rapid 2½ percent
last year, GDP rose at a still-solid annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, and we see
growth maintaining this pace for the remainder of the year. In the emerging market
economies (EMEs), GDP growth looks to have picked up from 3.4 percent in the fourth
quarter to almost 4 percent in the first quarter and should come in at nearly that pace in
k
o
the next few quarters. Beyond 2018, we see aggregate foreign growth edging down a o
l
t
u
touch to settle at around its potential rate of 2¾ percent in 2020.
O
&
l
e
Our foreign outlook is little changed from the March Tealbook on balance. v
e
D
Although economic indicators in the AFEs have come in a little weaker than expected,
n
o
we have seen positive surprises in some emerging Asian economies. So far this year we c
E
have not seen the sequence of upward revisions to our outlook that occurred last year. ’ l
t
n
I
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that foreign growth could again exceed
expectations, leading to a weakening of the dollar and a boost to the U.S. economy. We
explore such a development in the “Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar”
alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.
In the AFEs, rising retail energy prices helped boost headline inflation to an
annual rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage point higher than projected in
March. AFE inflation in the current quarter has also been revised up to 2 percent on
account of higher oil prices. Core inflation has picked up in Canada over the past few
quarters but remains subdued in the euro area and Japan. With inflation pressures
remaining contained over the next few years, we continue to assume only a gradual
withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus in the AFEs. In particular, the European Central
Bank (ECB) is not expected to raise its policy rate until the second quarter of 2019.
Moreover, we do not see the ECB, the Bank of England (BOE), or the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) starting to reduce the size of their balance sheets any time soon.
In the EMEs, monetary policies are more diverse. Some Asian central banks,
after a period of very low policy rates, are now raising rates with a pickup in growth. In
contrast, some central banks in Latin America, such as Brazil’s, have been cutting their
Page 35 of 126

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) April 20, 2018
policy rates in response to weakness in their economies. The Bank of Mexico (BOM)
remains in a tightening cycle in response to significant overshooting of inflation relative
to target and is expected to lower its policy rate only next year.
Further monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, as well as eventual
policy normalization by other major central banks, will lead to an increase in global
interest rates. In our baseline, we expect global financial markets to take this
normalization in stride, with sovereign, corporate, and household debtors able to adjust to
higher debt service needs. However, a more substantial policy tightening by the Federal
Reserve than in our baseline, perhaps prompted by a faster-than-expected rise in inflation,
k
o could lead to turbulence in global financial markets and create problems for debtors,
o
l
u t especially EME corporates. The consequences of such an outcome are discussed in our
O
& “Global Tightening Tantrum” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section;
l
e additionally, the EME corporate debt situation is analyzed in the box “How Risky Is
v
e
D Corporate Debt in Emerging Market Economies?” Finally, we remain attuned to other
n
o
c risks, including an eruption of trade wars or a sharp escalation of the geopolitical tensions
E
’ l in the Middle East that have recently pushed up oil prices.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
 Euro area. Recent indicators, such as industrial production and exports through
February, suggest that real GDP growth stepped down from 2.7 percent in the fourth
quarter to about 2 percent in the first. However, with PMIs and confidence indicators
for March still at levels consistent with solid economic activity, we project GDP
growth to edge up to 2¼ percent in the current quarter. GDP growth should then
gradually slow to 1¾ percent in 2020, a bit above its potential rate. Compared with
the March Tealbook, this forecast is about ½ percentage point lower in the first
quarter of 2018 and little changed thereafter.
Headline inflation increased to 2.1 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter,
temporarily boosted by a surge in energy prices. Core inflation rose to 1.4 percent in
the first quarter from an unusually low print of 0.2 percent in the fourth. We expect
both headline and core inflation to decelerate somewhat and then edge up to
1¾ percent only by 2020, as resource slack gradually diminishes and wage growth
firms. Given this subdued inflation outlook, the ECB has continued to communicate
the need for ample monetary policy accommodation. Accordingly, we expect the
Page 36 of 126

--- Page 40 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) April 20, 2018
ECB to continue its asset purchases until the end of 2018 and increase its policy rate
only in the second quarter of 2019 by 0.15 percentage point to negative 0.25 percent.
 United Kingdom. U.K. indicators also suggest that GDP growth has slowed a bit, to
1¼ percent in the first quarter from 1.6 percent in the fourth. This estimate is
¼ percentage point lower than in the March Tealbook, on weaker-than-expected
construction and services indicators, partly reflecting adverse weather conditions.
Growth is expected to increase to about 1¾ percent in the current quarter, supported
by a recent pickup in real wages.
As we expected, the European Union (EU) and British authorities agreed last month kk
oo
oo
on a 21-month transition period after the official U.K. withdrawal from the EU next ll
tt
uu
March. During this transition the United Kingdom will stay in the EU’s customs OO
&&
union and single market but will be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries. ll
ee
vv
As Brexit uncertainty fades, supporting business confidence, and with the help of ee
DD
nn
accommodative monetary policy, economic activity should continue to expand at just oo
cc
EE
above its potential rate of 1½ percent throughout the forecast horizon. This
ll
’’
tt
projection is a touch weaker than in the March Tealbook, mostly because of nn
II
appreciation of the pound.
Inflation in the first quarter declined to 2.5 percent from 3 percent in the fourth,
mainly because of waning effects of past currency depreciation. We continue to
expect that inflation will gradually fall to the BOE’s 2 percent target by the end of
2020. We anticipate that the BOE will gradually raise its policy rate from its current
level of 0.5 percent, reaching 1¾ percent by the end of 2020.
 Canada. With the auto industry recovering from earlier strikes and maintenance
shutdowns, we estimate that GDP growth edged up to 2 percent in the first quarter.
Although this pace is somewhat below our March Tealbook forecast—partly owing to
disruptions in the oil industry—recent indicators, including the Labour Force Survey
and manufacturing PMI through March, point to continued solid momentum. We see
growth staying close to 2 percent through the forecast horizon.
Inflation increased to 3.6 percent in the first quarter, reflecting higher retail energy
prices and increasing resource utilization. We expect inflation to remain elevated at
2½ percent in the current quarter before slowing to 2 percent by next year. The Bank

How Risky Is Corporate Debt in Emerging Market Economies?
Since 2007, nonfinancial corporate (NFC) debt in emerging markets (EMEs) has tripled in dollar
value, reaching $28 trillion in the third quarter of 2017. Although EME corporate debt as a share
of GDP has declined slightly since 2016, it remains elevated at around 110 percent of GDP (figure 1).
A large majority of the increase since 2007 is accounted for by China (the red line), where NFC
debt has risen to 170 percent of GDP. But NFC debt in the other EMEs has also risen notably (note
the different scale). The rapid increase in corporate debt has raised concerns about the risks this
debt might pose to EMEs and the global economy. In particular, rising global interest rates, in
part as advanced economies tighten monetary policy, could lead to higher EME debt‐servicing
burdens, weaker currencies, capital outflows, and lower earnings. Such developments could
kk weigh on EME corporates, especially those that are highly leveraged or have high levels of dollar‐
oo
oo denominated debt, potentially triggering loan losses, bond defaults, and broader financial stress.
ll
tt
uu
OO
We evaluate the overall riskiness of EME corporate debt using the interest coverage ratio (ICR),
&&
ll or the ratio of earnings to interest expense, which measures the capacity of firms to meet their
ee
vv
ee interest payments out of earnings. Firms that are more profitable, are less leveraged, or have
DD
lower borrowing costs will have higher ICRs, indicating a greater capacity to service their debt.
nn
oo
cc An ICR of 2 or less is typically associated with an increased likelihood of distress.1 As shown in
EE
ll figure 2, since 2008, the ICR for EME corporates has declined, on average, amid weaker earnings
’’
tt
nn and higher leverage. As a result, risky debt of EME corporates—measured as the debt of firms
II
with ICRs less than 2—has increased as a share of GDP, with most of that rise occurring in China
(figure 3). Over the past two years, the firming of global growth has improved earnings, lowering
the amount of risky debt and facilitating the orderly deleveraging process currently under way.
1 For example, just before the Asian financial crisis, firms in Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia had an average ICR
of 2; see Michael Pomerleano (1998) “Corporate Finance Lessons from the East Asian Crisis,” Viewpoint: Public
Policy for the Private Sector Note 155 (Washington: World Bank, October),
https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/11531.

Nevertheless, the share of risky debt in China remains above what was observed in the East Asian
economies before the Asian financial crisis. In other EMEs, debt at risk appears manageable at
less than 10 percent of GDP. However, the threshold at which debt at risk starts to be
problematic can differ across countries. For example, while a country may not have as much
vulnerability with respect to its corporate debt as, say, China, it may also have relatively less
resources to address problems that may arise.
How vulnerable are EME NFCs to an increase in borrowing costs, perhaps related to monetary
policy tightening in the advanced economies? To gauge these effects, we use firm‐level data and
stress each firm’s financials by increasing the average borrowing cost 1 percentage point (the
effects of which are shown by the solid red portion of the bars in figure 4).2 Except for China,
where debt at risk is estimated to rise 20 percentage points of GDP, this increase in borrowing
kk
costs by itself would not be problematic. But higher global interest rates might be accompanied oo
oo
by broader financial stress and slower EME growth, similar to what is presented in our “Global tt ll
uu
Tightening Tantrum” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. To model these OO
&&
effects, we consider two additional shocks: reducing earnings 20 percent (the effects are shown
ll
ee
by the red cross‐hatched portion of the bars) and imposing a 20 percent exchange rate vv
ee
devaluation on the amount of debt that is denominated in foreign currency (the red hatched DD
nn
portion of the bars). Taken together, the shocks double the share of overall EME risky debt in oo
cc
GDP to around the level observed for the East Asian economies before the Asian financial crisis. EE
ll
The increase mostly reflects China. But even outside of China, the shocks more than double the tt ’’
nn
amount of risky debt in many EMEs. II
All told, a gradual normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies, driven by faster
economic growth, is not likely to cause significant financing problems for EME corporates. But a
sharper rise in interest rates accompanied by broader financial stress could be quite severe for
EME corporates. Such problems could threaten financial stability if they spill over to banks and
create an adverse feedback loop that the authorities have trouble containing.
2 Although on the face of it this shock does not seem too large, it is applied to the average interest rate on
the entire existing debt, not just on new debt. Given that the average interest rate for EME firms is about
4¾ percent, a 1 percentage point rise increases the interest expense about one‐fifth.

of Canada is expected to gradually raise its policy rate from 1.25 percent to 3 percent
by mid-2020.
 Japan. Recent readings of industrial production and the manufacturing PMI point to
a step-down in Japanese GDP growth to 1¼ percent in the first quarter from
1.6 percent in the fourth. We see GDP growth edging down further to just below
1 percent, still slightly above its potential rate, by mid-2019 before temporarily
turning negative as a result of a long-planned consumption tax hike. Compared with
the March Tealbook, this projection is just a touch down in the first half of 2018 and
unchanged thereafter.
kk
oo
oo
ll Inflation picked up further to 2.5 percent in the first quarter, as retail energy and food
tt
uu
OO prices rose rapidly. Still, with core inflation remaining quite subdued, we expect
&&
ll overall inflation to fall back to ¾ percent over the remainder of the year. Excluding
ee
vv
ee the effects of the consumption tax hike on inflation in the fourth quarter of 2019,
DD
nn
inflation is expected to stabilize around 1 percent through 2020, well short of the
oo
cc
EE
BOJ’s 2 percent target. We expect the BOJ to keep its deposit rate slightly negative
ll

tt
nn throughout the forecast period and to continue with asset purchases.
II
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
 China. Real GDP growth picked up to 7.1 percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage
point higher than in the March Tealbook. Growth was boosted by a recovery of
industrial activity, as temporary curbs on production in heavily polluting industries
were lifted. Exports also picked up from an already strong fourth quarter. We expect
growth to slow to 6¼ percent in the second half of the year and to 6 percent by 2020,
as export growth normalizes and as the authorities’ efforts to reduce financial risks
and rein in local government spending weigh on domestic demand.
We estimate that the proposed U.S. section 301 tariffs on imports from China would
have a limited effect on the Chinese economy because the targeted goods, valued
roughly at $50 billion, account for a small share of China’s GDP. (These tariffs
would be on top of the recently levied steel and aluminum tariffs, which should have
even more limited effects.) However, a substantial extension of tariffs—for example,
to all Chinese imports into the United States—would indeed pose a material risk to
the outlook for China and the emerging Asian region as a whole.

Inflation fell to 1.5 percent in the first quarter, almost one-half the fourth-quarter rate,
mainly because of a decline in pork prices. We see inflation moving back up to its
longer-term trend of 2½ percent by the middle of this year. Although China’s
proposed retaliatory tariffs on its imports from the United States add an upside risk to
this forecast, we expect the effect of these tariffs on prices to be limited.
 Other Emerging Asia. After slowing significantly at the end of last year as high-tech
exports moderated, real GDP growth is estimated to have jumped to 4½ percent in the
first quarter from 3.2 percent in the fourth, driven by renewed strength in the region’s
overall exports. While export growth and industrial production have been strong,
kk
recent PMIs point to weaker momentum going into the second quarter. We expect oo
oo
ll
growth to moderate to a trend pace of 3¾ percent by next year. tt
uu
OO
&&
 Mexico. Recent solid indicators, such as construction through February as well as ll
ee
vv
ee
both manufacturing and services PMIs, suggest a continued recovery from the
DD
nn
hurricanes and earthquakes that occurred last year. We estimate that GDP expanded oo
cc
EE
2¾ percent in the first quarter, a small step-down from 3.2 percent in the fourth,
ll
’’
tt
nn
mainly because of a slower expansion of exports through February. We see growth
II
picking back up to about 3 percent by early 2019, held up by strong external demand,
diminished drag from fiscal consolidation, and stronger private consumption as
falling inflation boosts real wages.
Headline inflation declined to 4.1 percent in the first quarter from over 5 percent in
the second half of last year and nearly 10 percent a year ago. The decline in inflation
over the past few months reflects the effects of monetary policy tightening, peso
appreciation, and the fading effect of previous hikes in food prices. Despite falling
inflation, the BOM kept its policy rate on hold at 7.5 percent in mid-April rather than
cutting rates, citing continued concerns that adverse developments, such as an
unfavorable outcome of NAFTA negotiations or financial volatility associated with
Mexican elections in July, could lead to renewed peso depreciation.
 Brazil. After taking a breather in the fourth quarter, Brazil’s economy appears to
have resumed its gradual climb out of the country’s deepest recession on record. We
have penciled in growth of 2¼ percent in the first quarter amid a surge in exports,
solid PMI readings, and improved consumer confidence. We expect the pace of
activity to pick up gradually and reach 3 percent by 2019, supported by global
demand, particularly for Brazil’s commodity exports. Political uncertainty remains
Page 41 of 126

--- Page 45 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) April 20, 2018
the major downside risk, especially given the urgent need for policymakers to tackle
the country’s fiscal problems amid an unpredictable outcome of the upcoming
October presidential election. The front-runner of this election, former President Luiz
Inácio Lula da Silva, was imprisoned earlier this month for corruption and is likely to
be eliminated from the race.
Amid considerable economic slack, inflation remained subdued at about an annual
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter, somewhat below the inflation target. The
central bank is expected to cut its policy rate at its next meeting in May to a record
low of 6.25 percent.

Financial Market Developments
Domestic equity markets continued to experience heightened volatility over the
intermeeting period as a result of developments in U.S.–China trade policy and the
technology sector, though they were considerably less volatile than in early February. On
net, however, market participants’ outlook for monetary policy and economic growth
appears to be largely unchanged.
 A straight read of market quotes shows that the probability of a rate hike at the
June meeting increased somewhat to 85 percent, with two hikes priced in
between now and the end of this year.
 The nominal Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, driven primarily by an
increase in short-term yields, as longer-term yields were roughly unchanged.
Carry-adjusted TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation increased over
the period.
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged down on net. The VIX has declined
since the March FOMC meeting, though it is high compared with last year,
and realized volatility of equity prices remained elevated relative to its
average over the past few years. Credit spreads on investment-grade
s
t
e
corporate bonds were little changed, while those on speculative-grade bonds k
r
a
narrowed a bit. M
l
a
ci
 Conditions in foreign financial markets were not much changed since the last n
a
n
FOMC meeting. Foreign equity prices exhibited notable fluctuations and Fi
ended the period modestly higher outside of emerging Asia. Longer-term
foreign sovereign yields moved little, and the broad dollar depreciated
slightly.
 Rates in short-term dollar funding markets remained elevated but do not seem
to indicate credit risk concerns. Changes in rates and volumes over quarter-
end were relatively muted.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic Developments
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally viewed by
market participants as reflecting an overall upbeat outlook for economic growth and as
consistent with a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation. The
FOMC’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at the
March meeting was widely anticipated. Nevertheless, the market reaction to the March
FOMC communications was consistent with slightly more accommodative policy than
expected, as the median target rate path in the March SEP implied three rate hikes in
2018 whereas some investors had anticipated four rate hikes. Some investors pointed to
the median of participants’ SEP projections for core PCE inflation rising above 2 percent
in both 2019 and 2020 as an indication of the Committee’s willingness to continue along
a gradual path of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate even if inflation
temporarily moves above target. Market reaction to the release of the March FOMC
minutes later in the intermeeting period was minimal.
Domestic data releases over the intermeeting period generally elicited limited
market reaction. Total nonfarm payroll employment in the March Employment Situation
report came in notably below reported market expectations, but market commentaries
attributed the weakness in part to weather-related effects. The average hourly earnings
component of the March employment report and the March CPI both printed largely in s
t
e
k
line with expectations. r
a
M
l
a
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts shows that the market- ci
n
implied probability for the next rate hike occurring at the June FOMC meeting moved up a
n
Fi
to around 85 percent since the March FOMC meeting. OIS-implied federal funds rates
unadjusted for term premiums suggest that two rate hikes are priced in between now and
the end of this year, while a staff model that adjusts for term premiums implies three
hikes. Implied rates at the end of 2019 and 2020 were about unchanged.
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened a bit further over the intermeeting
period, with yields on 2-year Treasury securities up 11 basis points and yields on 10-year
Treasury securities higher by 3 basis points. The spread between 10-year and 2-year
Treasury securities stands at about the 20th percentile of its distribution since 1990. If
adjusted for term premiums, the difference between the two rates is currently at about the

40th percentile of its distribution since 1990.1 TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation increased on net.
Measures of option-implied volatility on long-term rates continued to decline over
the intermeeting period after their marked increase earlier this year, and they are now
close to the levels seen late last year.
Following the sharp increase in early February, realized volatility in the equity
market remained somewhat elevated due in large part to news related to trade policy.
However, the S&P 500 index declined only a bit over the period on net. Equity prices
deteriorated as trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated early in the
intermeeting period, although prices subsequently improved as tensions showed signs of
easing. Additionally, negative technology sector–related news and concerns about
increased government oversight of the sector reportedly weighed on investor sentiment,
though the sector ended the period only slightly lower than the broader index. Bank
equity prices declined about 4 percent over the intermeeting period and underperformed
broad equity indexes, on net, likely reflecting concerns about trade policy, tepid loan
growth, and weaker-than-expected trading revenues. One-month-ahead option-implied
volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—declined but remained at elevated levels
relative to the previous year, ending the period at approximately 16 percent.
Volatility in the equity market did not spill over into the corporate bond market.

Foreign Developments
Global equity markets were volatile since the March FOMC meeting, with
investors in foreign markets also attuned to developments related to trade policies
between the United States and China and to news about the U.S. technology sector. On
balance, foreign equity price movements were mixed, long-term foreign sovereign yields
were generally little changed, and the broad dollar depreciated slightly over the period.
In Russia, although the currency depreciated sharply and equity prices fell following the
introduction of the new round of U.S. sanctions, stresses in Russian markets did not spill
over to other financial markets.
Net changes in foreign equity prices did not exhibit a strong overall pattern.
Japanese and European broad equity indexes outperformed their U.S. counterparts,
ending the period somewhat higher. Equity price indexes in Mexico and other Latin
American countries were modestly higher, while those in some emerging Asian
countries—which may be more directly affected by a potential deterioration in U.S.–
China trade relations—were lower. On balance, capital continued to flow into emerging
market mutual funds and emerging market bond spreads were little changed. Measures
of implied volatilities of foreign equities fluctuated since the previous FOMC meeting
and ended the period somewhat lower.
Over the intermeeting period, market-based measures of policy expectations were
s
generally little changed in the advanced foreign economies, with most of their central t
e
k
banks still expected to gradually move toward less accommodative monetary policy over r
a
M
the next couple of years. Long-term sovereign yields in the advanced foreign economies
l
a
also showed little movement.

n
a
n
Fi
On net, the broad dollar index declined about ¾ percent, largely because
relatively positive news about the current round of NAFTA negotiations led to
appreciation of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, two currencies with large weights
in the dollar index.
At the March quarter-end, money market conditions in Europe and Japan were
characterized as in line with expectations and consistent with previous quarter-end
dynamics. Over the intermeeting period, three-month currency swap basis spreads,
which at times have indicated dollar funding pressures abroad, narrowed to the lowest
levels in recent years. Market participants attributed the decline to continued decreases in

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Conditions in short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the
intermeeting period despite the continuation of notably elevated spreads in segments of
the money market (see the box “Recent Pressures in Money Markets”). Both the
effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate continued to trade in the
upper third of the target range, while repo and Treasury bill rates remained elevated.
Because elevated rates on other short-term investments offered an attractive alternative
for market participants, take-up at the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP facility remained
subdued, averaging about $7 billion per day excluding quarter-end.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing three new overnight

Money market dynamics over quarter-end were muted relative to previous
quarter-ends. The effective federal funds rate dropped only 1 basis point, in contrast to
the typically observed decline of around 9 basis points.2 Foreign banks and dealers
usually reduce their activity in funding markets on quarter-end to improve their
s

Market participants reported no notable effect on money markets, Treasury yields, or
option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS as a result of the normalization process.
Since the start of balance sheet normalization through March 2018, the Federal Reserve’s
holdings of Treasury securities have decreased by $40 billion, and its holdings of agency
securities have decreased by $16 billion. Consistent with the Committee’s Policy
Normalization Principles and Plans, the monthly caps on reductions of Treasury and
agency securities increased in April to $18 billion and $12 billion, respectively.
2 The Good Friday market holiday on March 30 coincided with the March quarter-end and could
have contributed to these atypical dynamics.

Recent Pressures in Money Markets
The upward pressure on private money market rates, beyond that driven by expected monetary
policy, persisted over the intermeeting period. In unsecured markets, the London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR) and rates on commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit
(CDs) remained abnormally high relative to overnight index swap (OIS) rates of comparable
maturities, particularly at tenors exceeding one month. In secured markets, Treasury repo rates
remained elevated relative to the effective federal funds rate, and the spread is also very high by
historical standards. Table 1 shows that a variety of private spreads are currently near the top ends
of their historical ranges. Since the March FOMC meeting, however, spreads on Treasury bills
narrowed some, widening the gap between private money market rates and those on Treasury
bills, as shown in figure 1.
Several factors may have contributed to the wide spreads for private instruments, although none
appears to fully explain the unusually high level of current spreads. First, the surge in Treasury bill
supply in the first quarter appears to have pushed Treasury and unsecured private rates higher, and
the effects on private rates may be lingering temporarily even as bill issuance has slowed and rates
have edged down. Consistent with such a view, spreads on forward rate agreements, or FRAs, over

Figure 2
OIS, shown in figure 2, suggest that the LIBOR–OIS spread is expected to narrow in coming months.
Increased Treasury supply also appears to be an important factor in pressuring secured rates
higher, as dealers had to finance sizable issuance in February and March.
In unsecured markets, a second possible factor is that anticipated tax-induced repatriation flows
may have reduced offshore demand for private money market securities with longer tenors, and
aggregate demand for these securities would fall if repatriated cash is put to other uses. Anecdotal
reports from dealers suggest that cash-rich nonfinancial firms have shifted holdings toward very
short-dated instruments. In contrast, data from the offshore money market fund (OMMF) sector t s
e
only weakly support the repatriation story. OMMF assets under management have declined in k
r
a
recent weeks, but the funds do not appear to be shifting away from longer-dated assets in M
anticipation of further outflows, as weighted average maturities are little changed. a l

n

Other possible explanations are less compelling. Some market participants have suggested that n
the base erosion anti-abuse tax, or BEAT, which may effectively penalize foreign banks that raise
Fi
funds through foreign affiliates—and thus encourage raising short-term funds in U.S. markets—
might eventually boost unsecured rates. But the effects of the tax are unlikely to have materialized
yet, and issuance of CP and CDs has not increased in recent months. Another possibility is that
credit risk has driven rates higher. However, staff analysis of the historical relationship between
changes in three-month LIBOR–OIS spreads and aggregate credit default swap (CDS) spreads of
the largest banks indicates that the recent modest widening of these CDS spreads explains only a
trivial fraction of the LIBOR–OIS widening. Moreover, conversations with market participants have
not suggested any heightened credit-risk concerns.

New Overnight Treasury Repo Rates
On April 3, 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing three new overnight
Treasury repo rates. The purpose of the new rates is to increase the transparency of repo market
trading by providing interest rate and volume measures that cross the major repo market
segments. All of the repo rates exclude transactions in which the Federal Reserve is a
counterparty, such as take‐up at the ON RRP facility.
The Tri‐Party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) covers the “triparty” segment in which securities
dealers borrow cash directly from investors, including money market funds, in trades facilitated
by a third‐party clearing bank. The Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR) includes all transactions
in the TGCR and also includes blind‐brokered transactions between dealers that occur on the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s (FICC) GCF Repo service.
The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)—the blue line in the chart—measures the general
cost of financing Treasury securities overnight across all repo market segments for which data are
available, providing the broadest coverage of the repo market. A broad Treasury repo rate was
previously not available to the public. The SOFR is calculated from all transactions in the BGCR, as
well as bilateral transactions that are cleared by the FICC. The SOFR excludes bilateral
transactions that are executed at very low rates because such trades tend to be motivated by the
lender’s need to obtain a specific security as collateral rather than the need to invest cash.
In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee selected the SOFR as its recommended
alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, which is currently referenced in derivatives contracts with about
$190 trillion of notional value as well as $10 trillion of loans and securities. The transition from
LIBOR to SOFR is expected to take a number of years, and daily publication of the rate is a key
s
t
e step in the process.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Data received over the intermeeting period continue to indicate that financing
conditions for businesses and households remain supportive of economic activity.
• Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative.
Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was strong in March,
and equity issuance was robust. The extension of bank credit to businesses
increased following relatively weak growth in January and February.
• Conditions in the residential mortgage market remained supportive of financing
for most borrowers. For borrowers with low credit scores, conditions remained
tight but have continued to ease gradually.
• Growth in consumer loans moderated early this year from the more rapid pace
seen late last year, and banks responding to the April Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported tighter standards
for both credit card and auto loans. Nonetheless, on the whole, financing
conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of growth in
household spending.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS
Nonfinancial Corporations
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative over
the intermeeting period. Corporate bond spreads continued to be low by historical
standards, and following a somewhat subdued start to the year, gross issuance of
investment-grade corporate bonds was strong in March.1 Issuance of speculative-grade
debt was also solid in March, in line with its average volume over the past few years.
Institutional leveraged loan issuance in February and March was strong, largely reflecting
strength in demand from investors, including considerable funding for M&A activity.
Spreads on new issues of lower-rated institutional loans were roughly unchanged over the s

intermeeting period, while spreads for higher-rated loans narrowed a little further. ti

Growth in banks’ commercial and industrial (C&I) loans strengthened in March,
following relatively weak growth in January and February. Nonetheless, respondents to
the April SLOOS reported that C&I loan demand continued to weaken over the first
quarter. Banks that experienced subdued demand often reported that businesses were
generating more funds internally or shifting their borrowing to other lenders. (For a
discussion of the effect of the recent rise in short-term funding rates on financing
conditions more generally, see the box “Possible Effects of the Recent Increase in Short-
Term Funding Rates on Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households.”) SLOOS
respondents continued to report easing standards and terms on C&I loans, most often citing
increased competition from other lenders as the reason for doing so.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations was essentially stable over the
intermeeting period, although the ratio of aggregate debt to assets remains near
multidecade highs. The six-month trailing bond default rate ticked up in March to a level
in line with that seen about a year ago, while the KMV expected year-ahead default rate for
March was roughly unchanged from February and stood just below the median of its
historical range. The outlook for corporate earnings remains very favorable. Wall Street
analyst forecasts imply that earnings for S&P 500 firms are expected to be about
20 percent higher in 2018 than in 2017, with part of the increase reflecting lower
corporate taxes.
The pace of equity issuance through initial and seasoned offerings was robust in the
first quarter. Announced stock repurchases over the past two quarters were at their highest
levels in two years, suggesting that companies are expecting to distribute to shareholders at
least part of the increased cash they anticipate from lower corporate taxes and repatriation
of earnings held abroad.
Small Businesses
Small business credit conditions remained fairly accommodative over the
intermeeting period. Standards for C&I loans to small businesses eased modestly in the
April SLOOS. Although credit demand remains weak relative to pre-crisis levels, it has
shown signs of strengthening, and lending activity has increased in recent months. Loan

ti
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index—rose in February, leaving the series about di

Possible Effects of the Recent Increase in Short-Term Funding Rates on
Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
The elevated level of short-term funding rates relative to what would normally occur with
monetary policy tightening—as discussed in the box “Recent Pressures in Money Markets” in
the Financial Market Developments section—could serve to tighten financing conditions for
business and households. Here we assess the channels through which this might occur.
One potential channel is an increase in the direct cost of borrowing new funds or servicing
existing debt. Borrowers’ financing costs could increase in short-term funding markets, such
as commercial paper, or on financing instruments whose costs are tied to short-term rates,
such as floating-rate loans or lines of credit. 1 Longer-term borrowing rates could also
increase if lenders expect short-term rates to remain elevated over a longer period. To date,
longer-term borrowing rates have not appeared much affected by recently elevated short-
term spreads. Moreover, forward contracts suggest that investors do not expect the elevated
spreads to persist for long.
For households, a relatively modest share of debt is tied to short-term rates that have
experienced abnormal upward market pressure. Fewer than 20 percent of outstanding
residential mortgages have adjustable rates, and fewer than 10 percent of new originations
have adjustable rates. The majority of adjustable-rate mortgages are indexed to LIBOR, and a
minority of households with adjustable-rate mortgages could experience higher costs as their
loan rates reset. In contrast, floating interest rates on credit cards and home equity lines of
credit are typically indexed to the prime rate—an administered rate that has risen with the
federal funds rate but has not experienced abnormal upward market pressure. Most of the
outstanding auto and student loans have fixed rates and, thus, do not have rates that would
directly increase along with recently elevated short rates.
For businesses, direct borrowing in commercial paper represents a very small proportion—
around 2 percent—of total borrowing by nonfinancial firms. However, floating-rate loans are
common for businesses, and costs on such loans have increased with elevated short rates. As
the table on the next page shows, around 80 percent of commercial and industrial (C&I) and
commercial real estate (CRE) loans outstanding at the largest banks have floating rates. The
majority of these floating-rate loans are tied to LIBOR—typically, the three-month LIBOR.
While borrowing through floating-rate debt is more common for businesses, for many firms it
still represents a relatively small share of their total borrowing. Over 60 percent of borrowing
by large firms occurs through corporate bond markets in which interest rates are longer-term
fixed rates, and around one-third of CRE borrowing occurs though nonbank loans or CMBS
with fixed rates. Smaller firms tend to be more dependent on bank loans for financing.
1 Higher short-term rates could also serve to boost the income of investors in these funding instruments.
The extent to which this extra investment income serves to offset higher borrowing costs of businesses and
households depends on the marginal propensities of these investors to spend additional investment income
relative to the marginal propensities of the borrowers to spend.

Overall, while some businesses have experienced higher financing costs, the recent increase in
some short rates will not likely result in a large, direct increase in debt service burdens. Staff
analysis on the potential effects of a larger and more persistent rise in short-term rates than
has actually occurred indicates that debt service burdens for businesses and households
would only rise a modest amount.2 Moreover, borrowers who do rely more heavily on
floating-rate debt could potentially substitute toward fixed-rate debt or switch to floating-rate
debt tied to short-term rates not experiencing the same upward pressures, such as the one-
month LIBOR, serving to reduce the effects of elevated short-term spreads on direct
financing costs.
A second, less direct channel through which the recent upward pressure on short-term rates
could tighten financing conditions is reduced lending or higher-cost lending by financial
institutions experiencing higher funding costs. For example, financial institutions originating
new loans could set loan rates higher to offset any increase in their funding costs or could
choose to originate less loans. The extent to which this may occur depends on how much of
an increase in funding costs financial institutions experience. At present, it does not appear
that banks’ funding costs have risen appreciably, as most such funding comes in the form of
deposits, but banks and other financial institutions that are more reliant on wholesale funding
could see an increase in their funding costs.
Overall, the recent upward pressure on short-term rates does not appear to have affected the
borrowing costs or capacity of most households and businesses, and staff analysis suggests
that elevated short-term rates will not have a long-term effect on financing conditions. The
staff will continue to track developments in short-term funding markets and monitor changes
in financing conditions.

Commercial Real Estate
Conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) financing remained accommodative
over the intermeeting period. CRE loan growth at banks ticked up in the first quarter,
driven mainly by strong growth at small domestic and foreign banks. Regarding the
components of CRE loans, construction and land development loan growth weakened,
while growth in nonfarm nonresidential loans and in multifamily property loans rose.
Respondents to the April SLOOS reported easing standards on multifamily and nonfarm
nonresidential loans, along with somewhat weaker demand for nonfarm nonresidential
loans and construction and land development loans.
Taking a longer-term view, banks responding to special questions in the April
SLOOS about changes to CRE lending policies and demand over the past year reported
having eased lending terms, including offering lower spreads of loan rates over the cost of
funds and larger maximum loan sizes, across all three major CRE loan categories. Almost
all banks that eased CRE credit policies cited more aggressive competition from other
institutions as an important reason. Banks reporting weaker demand for CRE loans cited
shifts in borrowing to other credit sources and rising interest rates as prominent reasons.
Spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed
over the intermeeting period and remained near their post-crisis lows. CMBS issuance has
continued to be strong through March, although the low volume of loans maturing in
coming quarters may reduce demand for refinancing (and hence issuance) going forward.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on balance,
over the intermeeting period. Spreads on general obligation bonds over comparable-
maturity Treasury securities were roughly unchanged. Gross issuance of municipal bonds
in March recovered a bit from its low January and February levels but was still somewhat
below levels typically seen in March. The weak municipal bond issuance so far this year
likely is a consequence of very high December issuance, which was driven by concern that
pending tax legislation would remove the tax-exempt status of private activity bonds. (The
s
final legislation did not alter the tax status of such bonds.) n

for most borrowers. For borrowers with low credit scores, conditions have continued to
ease. For example, the maximum debt-service-to-income ratio that low-score mortgage
borrowers can obtain has risen steadily for the past several years. However, credit still
remains relatively tight for these borrowers, and the volume of mortgage loans extended to
this group remains low. For the overall mortgage market, rates on 30-year conforming
mortgages edged down about 5 basis points since the March FOMC, roughly in line with
yields on longer-term Treasury securities. However, mortgage rates remained around
60 basis points higher than in December and more than 100 basis points higher than in the
fall of 2016. Consistent with these higher rates, refinancing activity continues to be muted,
and the growth in mortgages for home purchases has slowed over the past year. Banks
responding to the April SLOOS reported weaker demand across most residential real estate
(RRE) loan categories, while standards were reportedly about unchanged for most RRE
loan types.
Consumer Credit
Financing conditions for consumer credit have, on balance, remained supportive of
growth in household spending. However, some indicators continue to point to a tightening
trend in the past several quarters.
Growth in consumer loan balances has moderated from the more rapid pace seen
late last year. In particular, credit card loan growth slowed significantly in early 2018 after
growing briskly in the fourth quarter of 2017. Indeed, respondents to the April SLOOS
reported that standards and terms on credit card loans tightened further, and demand for
these loans weakened in the first quarter. In addition, interest rates on credit card accounts
continued to trend up, reflecting in part pass-through from tightening monetary policy.
Nonetheless, on balance, credit card debt remained readily available to prime-rated
borrowers but tight for subprime borrowers.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS n
U
&
As in the March Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of s
k
s
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark Ri
used by the FOMC. Although financial market volatility remains elevated—reportedly
reflecting, in part, uncertainty about trade policy—uncertainty about fiscal policy has
diminished with the enactment of the appropriations bill that funds government
operations through September.
We continue to judge the risks around our projection for real GDP growth as
being balanced. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater
expansion in economic activity than expected in the baseline. On the downside, given
that the economy is already operating above its potential level and resource utilization is
projected to tighten further, those fiscal policy changes could provide less impetus to the
economy than assumed in the baseline. Similarly, we see the risks around our
unemployment rate forecast as balanced. Although we assume, with the economy
operating above the level associated with full employment, that the unemployment rate
will decline a bit less than would be expected given the rise in the output gap, the shift
toward other margins of resource utilization could be greater than we anticipate.
Alternatively, it is possible that the unemployment rate will exhibit a more typical
relationship with the output gap—or decline even more if the high-pressure economy
leads to a further reduction in the natural rate of unemployment.
Consistent with our judgmental assessment, estimates of the distribution of risks
around our GDP and unemployment rate forecasts conditional on available indicators,
shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly wide or
skewed. Indeed, one important source of downside risk to real activity has diminished
significantly in recent years: As presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk
Estimate,” stochastic simulations around the baseline path in the FRB/US model indicate
that the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three
years is only about 9 percent. If the ELB risk were computed around the median federal
funds rate path from the FOMC’s March SEP, the estimated probability would be
17 percent.

With regard to inflation, we still see average uncertainty and balanced risks
y
n t around our projection. With the estimated 12-month change in core PCE prices having
ai
t moved up to 1.9 percent in March, the risk that last year’s softness in inflation could
r
e
c
n prove to be more persistent than we assumed has abated somewhat. However, there is
U
& still a risk that the inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could
s
k currently be lower than in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming years as we
s
Ri
have assumed. To the upside, with the economy projected to be moving further above its
long-run potential, inflation may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.
Our judgmental assessments of typical uncertainty and balanced risks are consistent with
the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which judges the overall financial
vulnerabilities in the United States and overseas to be moderate. Vulnerabilities from
leverage in the U.S. financial system, as well as from liquidity and maturity
transformation, appear low; in particular, banks are highly capitalized and hold
substantial amounts of high-quality liquid assets. However, asset valuation pressures in
the U.S. are elevated despite easing since early February’s period of increased market
volatility, and they also appear stretched in a number of foreign economies. In addition,
there are some potential sources of vulnerability in the U.S. nonfinancial corporate
business sector. In particular, corporate debt relative to nominal GDP is at the upper end
of historical experience and risk premiums on corporate bonds are compressed relative to
their average since the mid-1990s.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the
baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario illustrates the
outcomes of a recession in which the effects are amplified by leverage constraints on
financial intermediaries that curtail the supply of credit. The second scenario examines
the negative consequences of supply constraints that could arise when labor markets are
very tight for an extended period. In contrast, in the third scenario, running the economy
“hot” for a while leads to persistent positive effects on the productive capacity of the
economy—a form of “positive hysteresis.” In the fourth scenario, we illustrate a
downside risk to inflation associated with the possibility that households and businesses

have lower inflation expectations than in the baseline because they perceive that
y
monetary policy will be too tight to sustainably return inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent n t
ai
objective over the medium term. In the fifth scenario, we consider the possibility that t
r
e
c
faster tightening in U.S. monetary policy, prompted by a pickup in inflation, leads to n
U
financial turbulence in vulnerable emerging market economies and a stronger &
s
appreciation of the dollar. The sixth and last scenario analyzes the effect of stronger k
s
Ri
foreign growth and a weaker dollar.
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of five staff models that embed
different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.1 (For a discussion of forecast errors
over the past year from two staff models, see the box “FRB/US and EDO Forecast
Errors” at the end of this section.) In all scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by
the same policy rule as in the baseline. In addition, the size and composition of the
SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios.
Financial-Based Recession [Gertler, Karadi Model]2
The last three QS reports have highlighted that asset valuations are elevated and
that leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is an area of potential vulnerability,
although overall financial vulnerabilities are judged to be moderate and commercial
banks are well capitalized. In this scenario, we move beyond regulated deposit-taking
institutions and consider risks to the intermediation sector, including shadow banks. We
assume that there is a correction in asset prices that reduces intermediaries’ capital, which
tightens leverage constraints and further disrupts the supply of credit. In addition, this

baseline at the end of 2018 and peaks at 7 percent in 2019 before slowly returning toward
the baseline. Inflation slows only a little relative to the baseline, because the Phillips
curve is flat and monetary policy provides substantial accommodation. Even under the
inertial Taylor rule assumed here, the federal funds rate decreases 2 percentage points in
response to the rapid increase in slack and comes within 25 basis points of the ELB.
Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, Trigari Model]
In the baseline projection, the unemployment rate declines to 3¼ percent by the
end of 2019 and remains below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate for a number of
years. However, with the economy operating so far above its potential, it is possible that
supply constraints will begin to emerge and that these constraints are not fully captured in
the baseline projection. In particular, when the unemployment rate is unusually low,
filling a vacancy becomes more difficult, which could imply a reduced pace of hiring and
a substantially steeper rise in wage growth. In this scenario, we illustrate these risks
using simulations from a nonlinear New Keynesian model with costly search and
matching frictions in the labor market.3 In this model, recruiting costs and wages are
higher when the unemployment rate is low because firms have to spend more time and
resources looking for workers and have to raise wages to attract them.
In such an environment, the unemployment rate stays roughly constant at
4 percent until the end of 2020, ½ percentage point above the baseline; thereafter, it
returns to its natural rate. GDP growth is close to the baseline until the end of 2020
because, in this model, more-intense utilization of capital compensates for the reduction
in labor input. Growth slows after 2020 as the unemployment rate rises toward its natural
3 See also Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau and Lu Zhang (2017), “Solving the Diamond-Mortensen-
Pissarides Model Accurately,” Quantitative Economics, vol. 8 (2), pp. 611–50, who show that simulations
from a standard search-and-matching model deliver state-dependent responses to shocks: The
unemployment rate responds less to shocks when the initial state of the economy is “hot” compared to an
initial state with substantial labor market slack.

Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]
Ri
In contrast to the previous scenario, the hot labor market in the baseline projection
is assumed in this scenario to have persistent positive effects on the productive capacity
of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as “positive hysteresis.” Specifically,
we assume that persistent exposure to a hot economy reduces exits from the labor force
and generates additional entrants, causing the trend labor force participation rate to rise
about 1 percentage point above the baseline by the end of 2023. Furthermore, we assume
that the experience that workers gain through greater employment lowers the natural rate
of unemployment ½ percentage point by the end of 2023. Both of these favorable
developments are assumed to be recognized in real time by monetary policymakers.4
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ¼ percentage point more
per year over the projection period than in the baseline. This additional room to grow
allows real GDP growth to run at a similar increment above the baseline. As a result, the
output gap is little changed. The unemployment rate is close to the baseline until the end
of 2019 because increases in labor force participation offset gains in employment. After
2019, the unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory and is about ¼ percentage point
below the staff projection by 2023. With inflation and the output gap roughly at the
baseline, the federal funds rate is little changed.5
4 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the
natural rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-
generating components.
5 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential
output, the federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching
5¼ percent by the end of 2021. In that case, real GDP growth would be ¼ percentage point lower, on
average, between 2020 and 2023 than in this scenario, with the unemployment rate ¼ percentage point
higher than in this scenario. Inflation would still remain close to the baseline.

Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model]
y
t
n
ai
t Headline inflation, as measured by the change in PCE prices, has been below the
r
e
c
n Committee’s 2 percent objective for most of the past five years and averaged only about
U
& 1¼ percent during that period. In the baseline projection, we have assumed a small,
s
k gradual rise in inflation expectations. However, in light of the persistently low inflation
s
Ri
of the past several years, there is a risk that the public perceives the stance of monetary
policy as being too tight to sustainably achieve the 2 percent objective. In this scenario,
we assume that current longer-run inflation expectations are ¼ percentage point lower
than in the baseline and remain that low for an extended period of time.
Lower inflation expectations cause actual inflation to run ¼ percentage point
below its baseline path during the simulation period. Consequently, the federal funds rate
increases less than in the baseline; even so, expected real interest rates are initially
slightly higher because inertia in the assumed policy rule prevents the federal funds rate
from adjusting more rapidly. As a result, real GDP growth is a touch lower in 2018 than
in the baseline, and the unemployment rate runs slightly higher through 2023.
Global Tightening Tantrum [SIGMA]
In our baseline, we see the spillovers of ongoing U.S. policy tightening as likely
to be manageable for most foreign economies. However, there remains a significant risk
that faster U.S. policy tightening than investors expect could exert sizable disruptive
effects on global financial markets and the global economy. This scenario considers the
possibility that higher-than-expected U.S. inflation causes investors to quickly revise
their expectations about the stance of U.S. monetary policy, causing global bond term
premiums to rise and the prices of risky assets to decline, with pronounced adverse
spillovers especially to emerging market economies (EMEs).
Specifically, our scenario assumes that U.S. core PCE inflation runs at around
2½ percent through 2018 and prompts the FOMC to remove policy accommodation
somewhat faster than in the baseline.6 These developments boost term premiums on
longer-term government bonds as well as spreads on corporate bonds in both the United
States and abroad. Tighter global financial conditions weigh on foreign economies and
6 The scenario embeds transient monetary policy shocks, which allow for a somewhat faster initial
rise in the federal funds rate than implied by the inertial Taylor rule.

Weaker foreign activity, the appreciation of the dollar, and tighter financial
conditions restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States. U.S. GDP
growth moderates to 1 percent in 2019, about 1½ percentage points less than in the
baseline. Core PCE inflation peaks at 2¾ percent in 2019 and then moves down toward
the 2 percent target. Starting in 2020, the federal funds rate edges down, falling below
the baseline path.
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar [SIGMA]
Over the past year, the dollar has fallen despite higher U.S. interest rates and
prospects for substantial U.S. fiscal stimulus. In part, this depreciation reflects solid
foreign growth and the anticipation of policy normalization abroad. Going forward, our
baseline forecast is for the dollar to appreciate, as the federal funds rate rises more steeply
than markets expect. However, it is possible that foreign growth will exceed expectations
and put further downward pressure on the dollar. In this scenario, we assume that foreign
GDP growth rises to about 3½ percent in 2018 and 2019, and thus averages about
¾ percentage point higher per year than under our baseline projection. Increased
optimism about the durability of the foreign expansion—and the perception of
diminished tail risks—cause the broad dollar to depreciate by 10 percent relative to
baseline by the end of 2019, reversing most of the rise in the dollar that began in
mid-2014.
U.S. real GDP expands around 3 percent in 2019, about ½ percentage point more
than in the baseline, as the weaker dollar and stronger foreign growth boost U.S. real net
exports. The unemployment rate falls to 2¾ percent by the end of 2020. Higher import
prices and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to reach 2½ percent in
2019. The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the baseline, increasing to
5½ percent by the end of 2020.

The FRB/US and EDO forecast errors are, on average, somewhat larger than the Tealbook

forecast errors, and neither model uniformly dominates the other one in forecasting s
Ri
performance. Overall, like the Tealbook forecast, both models underpredicted real GDP
growth and overpredicted the unemployment rate in 2017, with the largest error for GDP
growth found in FRB/US and the largest error for the unemployment rate found in EDO.
These forecast errors are within the 70 percent real‐time confidence intervals of these
models as indicated by the whisker bands. However, the realized unemployment rate is
located very close to the lower bounds of the 70 percent confidence intervals of all the
forecasts, including the Tealbook projection.2
FRB/US did well in forecasting both total and core PCE inflation. From 2014 to 2017, its
root mean squared errors are 0.2 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point,
respectively, which are smaller than or equal to those of the EDO and Tealbook
projections. That said, both models viewed inflation as having been surprisingly weak in
2017 and to a greater extent than the judgmental projection, particularly in the case of
core inflation. It is notable that both models made forecast errors for core PCE inflation
outside of or very close to the lower bounds of the 70 percent confidence intervals.3
The FRB/US model attributes the higher‐than‐expected GDP growth in 2017 to stronger‐
than‐expected private spending and stronger foreign factors, such as a weaker dollar and
stronger net exports. The EDO model largely attributes the upward surprise in GDP
growth last year to a low risk premium and a somewhat stronger transient improvement
in productivity. Because the two sources of stronger GDP growth have opposite
implications for slack, the EDO model attributes the bulk of the forecast errors in both
total and core PCE inflation to “own” shocks in the non‐energy price equations; in other
words, the surprise could not primarily be explained by the forecast errors in other
conditioning variables such as slack. The FRB/US model also views the downside
surprises in inflation as originating directly from the price equations.
1 The confidence intervals for EDO and FRB/US are generated via stochastic simulations. For
FRB/US, the simulations sample from historical equation residuals. For EDO, they draw from the
distributions of shocks, model parameters, and latent state variables.
2 The improvement in the forecasting accuracy for unemployment in the EDO model in 2016 relative
to the two previous years is linked to a revision of the assumed steady‐state level of unemployment to
align it with the Tealbook assumptions about the natural rate of unemployment at that time.
3 Note that the staff had seen the very low March CPI by the time of the April Tealbook in 2017, even
though the PCE prices for March were not themselves published yet, so that information was built into
the Tealbook projection. While the staff took on board the implication of the weak incoming data for
the second quarter core PCE inflation, the models did not, which could be one source of the larger
model forecast errors for core PCE inflation.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

U
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&
s
k
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals Ri s
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
y
t intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. In the near term, the revisions to the strategies’
prescriptions are small. Over the medium term, the Tealbook baseline projection features
slightly lower levels of resource utilization and inflation than the projection made in
March; consequently, all strategies call for lower policy rates during coming years than
their counterparts in the previous Tealbook. A special exhibit reports the prescriptions of
several flexible price-level targeting rules.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the “balanced
approach” rule), the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and a nominal income
targeting (NIT) rule. These near-term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown by the black lines in the middle
panels. The top and middle panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal
funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1
• The near-term prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and the Taylor (1993) rules
are about unchanged from their March Tealbook levels because the effects of
the staff’s small downward revision to the output gap offset those of the
staff’s modest upward revision to inflation in coming quarters.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Except for the
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that
are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the March 2018 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline

• The prescriptions of the first-difference rule are a bit lower than in March
because the output gap is now projected to widen at a slower rate over the
coming year.
• Under the NIT rule, the federal funds rate responds to the output gap and the
shortfall of the GDP price deflator from the level it would have attained had it
increased at an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011; the shortfall in
the GDP price deflator in coming quarters is about 2¼ percent. Unlike the
other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call for raising the federal
funds rate in the near term, the NIT rule, in an effort to eliminate the shortfall
in the GDP price deflator, prescribes a level for the federal funds rate in the
second and third quarters that remains within the current target range.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March 2018 Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP).2 In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used
to generate an estimate of r*. The r*concept, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in
the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.
This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real
economy; because it is based on a single criterion, it does not take into account other
considerations, such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the
federal funds rate.
• At a bit under 3½ percent, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* in
this quarter is almost ½ percentage point below the corresponding value
computed using information from the March Tealbook. The downward
revision reflects the fact that the projected output gap in the current Tealbook
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the March 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth
and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the
SEP. For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.

is a bit more than ¼ percentage point lower, on average, through 2021 than in
the March Tealbook.
• At about 1½ percent, the SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower
than the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The difference stems from the fact
that the SEP-consistent projection has output exceeding potential by a
considerably smaller amount over the medium term than does the current
Tealbook forecast. This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact
that the median path for the real federal funds rate implied by SEP projections
averages almost 1 percentage point lower than the corresponding path in the
s
e Tealbook.

through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the
macroeconomy.4 The exhibit also reports the extended Tealbook baseline projection.
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate rises to about 2½ percent
by the end of this year. Over the subsequent two years, it increases by about
1 percentage point per year, bringing the rate close to 4¾ percent in the fourth
quarter of 2020.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding
3 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in
the top panel of the first exhibit.
4 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly
understands the implications of the FOMC adopting a particular policy strategy. In the real world, the
adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a period during which the public
learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications. We abstract from considerations of this kind.

Tealbook baseline values through early 2022. This higher path is associated
with only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10-year Treasury yield than
in the baseline through the middle of 2020, as the Taylor (1999) rule calls for
somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate for a sustained period later in
the simulation period. Because wage and price setting today is influenced by
expected future outcomes in FRB/US, current inflation is a touch higher as a
result of the somewhat more accommodative policy stance later in the
simulation relative to the Tealbook baseline projection. The resulting path for
the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook baseline path over the next
few years, but subsequently takes a bit longer to return to its natural rate.
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate. Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to
projected output exceeding its assumed potential level, the prescriptions of
this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown,
though they are higher than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years.
Starting in the fourth quarter of 2020, the path for the federal funds rate falls
below the baseline path for a sustained period. As a result, current inflation is
higher, and the real 10-year Treasury yield is lower, than their corresponding
values in the Tealbook projection. The more accommodative conditions
engender a more pronounced undershooting of the unemployment rate below
its natural rate beyond the medium term.
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first-difference rule is
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through early 2020 but
runs below the baseline path for some years thereafter. The latter divergence
occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to projected output
exceeding its assumed potential level by progressively smaller amounts
beyond the next three years. The associated lower path of the federal funds
rate, in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies
lower longer-term real interest rates than in the Tealbook baseline and
therefore higher levels of resource utilization and inflation. Thus, the first-
difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower,
and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than the corresponding outcomes in
the Tealbook baseline projection.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

• The NIT rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as
measured by the rate of increase in the GDP price deflator) from an annual
rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011. Compared with the Tealbook
baseline, the NIT rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the
federal funds rate in order to generate a somewhat higher rate of inflation in
coming years and thereby gradually undo the 2¼ percent cumulative shortfall
of inflation from 2 percent since the end of 2011. Because the simulation
embeds the assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this
gap and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters
correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates, the
path of the real 10-year Treasury rate is lower than under the other policy
rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years. Accordingly, the path for
the unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline
and all other simulations shown, dropping to 2¾ percent in 2021.
• Relative to the March Tealbook, the prescriptions of the simple rules are
between ¼ and ½ percentage point lower by the end of 2021 because of the
lower projected path of the output gap.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.6
Three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for the
federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection, for two reasons. First,
high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up
to its natural rate, because in the FRB/US model, the unemployment rate does not
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
6 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

respond strongly to changes in real interest rates, a feature that is consistent with recent
historical experience. Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be
understood and fully credible, the front-loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.
However, in practice, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as high and as
quickly as prescribed by the first three optimal control policies, macroeconomic
outcomes could be less benign than shown here because of the confusion and financial
market disruption that such an abrupt change in policy might engender.7 In contrast, the
fourth optimal control policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels last
experienced during the 1950s; such a development might also entail outcomes different
from those predicted by the simulations.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable
undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate over the next
several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with
the equal-weights loss function judge to be costly.8 The small projected
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates only
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the reaction of
inflation to the level of resource utilization is limited.
• The second simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
7 The simulation results hinge on the assumptions that agents in the model have perfect foresight
and are certain that policymakers will implement the prescribed path for the federal funds rate. While these
assumptions may be reasonable approximations under some circumstances, they may not be valid for
historically extreme changes in the federal funds rate, particularly those prescribed by the optimal control
exercise that places only a minimal penalty on adjustments in the federal funds rate.
8 When we use the March 2018 SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5 percent, compared
with about 8 percent under the Tealbook baseline.

identical to that specification. The resulting optimal strategy is only
marginally more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even
though the losses associated with undershooting the inflation objective are
larger in coming years. There are two reasons that the prescribed path for the
federal funds rate is not materially altered even though the weight on inflation
losses is substantially higher than in the “Equal weights” case. First, inflation
is already close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and, second, in the
FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff because inflation
responds only weakly to resource utilization.

• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but the loss
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the
unemployment rate is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of
the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control
simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path
throughout the period shown. With the asymmetric loss function,
policymakers choose this initially more accommodative path for the policy
rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an
aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment. The tighter labor
market helps bring inflation to 2 percent more quickly than in the case of
equal weights. Starting in the middle of the 2020s (not shown), the
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as
policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the
prolonged period of elevated resource utilization.

ILLUSTRATING FLEXIBLE PRICE-LEVEL TARGETING RULES
The following pages discuss several monetary policy rules that target the price
level rather than the inflation rate. Price-level targeting rules aim to reverse deviations of
inflation from policymakers’ objective rather than letting “bygones be bygones.” Such
rules have been studied as a form of commitment to making up shortfalls of policy
accommodation following an episode when the policy rate was constrained by the lower
bound or, more generally, as a means for increasing the predictability of future price
levels. The NIT rule discussed earlier is an example of a flexible price-level targeting
(FPLT) rule that not only seeks to stabilize an aggregate price index around a target path
but also responds to a measure of resource slack. The nominal income gap can be
decomposed into the sum of a price gap (the difference between the output price index
and a target path) and the output gap; under the NIT rule, by design, equally sized
movements in these gaps call for the same adjustments in the federal funds rate.9 In the
NIT rule simulation shown in the exhibits, the target path for prices is anchored in
2011:Q4, just before the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation objective, and
grows at a 2 percent annual rate thereafter.10
Because it is derived from nominal GDP, the NIT rule uses a GDP-based price
measure for its price gap along with the output gap as its measure of real activity.
However, under FPLT rules, the interest rate could respond to other price indices or
measures of resource utilization. As an illustration, the fourth exhibit considers three
FPLT rules that respond to the price gap measured using core PCE prices and to the
unemployment rate gap.11 The three FPLT rules vary in their response coefficients to the
price gap and the unemployment rate gap and in the reference date for their target path
for the price level. The first rule, “FPLT, large response to ugap (2011:Q4),” responds
twice as much to the unemployment rate gap as to the price gap, while the second rule,
“FPLT, equal responses,” reacts to both gaps in equal measure. As in the NIT rule, both
9 Under this implementation of the NIT rule, the target path of nominal GDP is adjusted for
changes in potential output growth. Nominal GDP targeting is sometimes understood as targeting a path
for nominal GDP that grows at a constant rate, in which case variations in potential output would call for
offsetting adjustments in inflation.
10 As shown in the appendix to this section, these assumptions imply that the price gap can be
expressed as the cumulative miss of output price inflation from 2 percent since the beginning of 2012.
11 The unemployment rate gap is defined as the unemployment rate minus the natural rate of
unemployment. The FPLT rules respond to this gap with a negative coefficient, so that when the
unemployment rate is higher (lower) than its natural rate, the FPLT rule prescribes a lower (higher)
interest rate.

of these FPLT rules seek to make up deviations in inflation from its 2 percent objective
since the beginning of 2012.12 The third rule, “FPLT, large response to ugap (2017:Q4),”
reacts to the unemployment rate and price gaps as in the “FPLT, large response to ugap
(2011:Q4) rule,” but seeks to make up deviations in inflation from 2 percent only since
the beginning of this year. The panels in the fourth exhibit report results from dynamic
simulations of the FRB/US model under the FPLT rules, the NIT rule, and the Tealbook
baseline rule.
• The economic outcomes under the “FPLT, large response to ugap (2011:Q4)”
rule are very close to those under the NIT rule because the initial price gaps
measured using core PCE prices and GDP prices are very similar, at about
2¼ percent, and because these two rules respond roughly equivalently to the
cyclical position of the economy.13 Both FPLT rules call for a more gradual
increase in the federal funds rate than the Tealbook baseline projection.
Given a more accommodative policy—and because, in these simulations,
policymakers credibly commit to sustaining accommodation until the price
gap is significantly reduced—inflation increases immediately and runs higher
than in the Tealbook baseline for a number of years. Low real interest rates
also spur faster growth of economic activity, and the unemployment rate
undershoots the baseline projection by about ½ percentage point in 2021.
• Under the “FPLT, equal responses (2011:Q4)” rule, the path for policy is even
more accommodative than the path under the “FPLT, large response to ugap
(2011:Q4)” rule because policymakers lean less strongly against the
unemployment rate undershooting its natural rate. As a result, inflation rises
and real activity booms, with the unemployment rate dropping to nearly
2¼ percent in 2021, about 1 percentage point below the baseline projection.
The price-level gap is closed notably more rapidly in this instance than under
the “FPLT, large response to ugap (2011:Q4)” rule.
• The “FPLT, large response to ugap (2017:Q4)” rule prescribes a path for the
federal funds rate that is nearly identical to the Tealbook baseline path.
12 The appendix to this section details the calibration of the FPLT rules.
13 In particular, the FRB/US model roughly satisfies the empirical regularity known as Okun’s law
by generating changes in the unemployment gap that are roughly half as large and of the opposite sign as
changes in the output gap. Hence, a coefficient of negative 2 on the unemployment gap has similar
implications to a coefficient of 1 on the output gap in a FPLT rule.

Unlike the rules with a 2011:Q4 anchor date for the price level, there is only a
small initial price gap to which policymakers would respond. Moreover, in
the baseline projection, inflation remains close to 2 percent, and the
responsiveness of this FPLT rule to resource slack is about the same as in the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule that is used to construct the baseline projection. As
a result, the paths for the unemployment rate and inflation under this FPLT
rule and the baseline rule are very similar. Relative to the policy prescriptions
from the other two FPLT rules, the path of the federal funds rate is
considerably higher.

• Overall, the simulations show that the FPLT rules that respond to a price gap
measured using core PCE prices and the unemployment rate gap can give rise
to a variety of economic outcomes, including outcomes similar to those under
the baseline Tealbook projection. In a downturn with a prolonged period of
inflation below the 2 percent target, all of the FPLT rules would provide a
large amount of accommodation compared with rules in which inflation
bygones are bygones, such as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule. Of course, the
efficacy of FPLT rules relies heavily on the assumptions that policymakers
can not only credibly commit to such policies and communicate them clearly
but also that the public understands and anticipates their effects.
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

level targeting rules in the context of a recession scenario.

Appendix
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a
small temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

output gap estimate for the current period ( ), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead

The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined
as the difference between nominal income, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of the
level of nominal GDP, and a target value, denoted and measured as 100 times the log of
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q∗4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate
𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently,
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of
potential GDP. These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be approximated as
the sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the
level it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1

inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2

minal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are

then converted to a 360-day basis.

NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
s price inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps

o The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four
M
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change
components of the loss function. The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four
specifications of the loss function.
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large
weight to inflation gaps. The third specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5 The fourth specification, “Asymmetric
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the
unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate. The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights
used in the four specifications. The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on
the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
FLEXIBLE PRICE-LEVEL TARGETING RULES
The table “FPLT Rules” shown below gives expressions for two flexible price-level
targeting rules reported in the exhibit, “Illustrating Flexible Price-Level Targeting Rules.” In the
table, denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a rule for quarter t. The right-hand-
side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE price inflation for

the difference between the core PCE price level, , and the ta𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿rget path, . For the rules in the
